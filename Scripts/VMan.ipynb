      " The classic shoe is getting a makeover in some seriously vibrant new colors The classic shoe is getting a makeover in some seriously vibrant new colors Text: Vienna Vernose First hitting the market in 1973, Adidas Stan Smiths have since been a universal favorite as the go-to white sneaker to match with pretty much anything in your closet. These days, the timeless classic is undergoing a major transformation in a limited-edition collaboration with celebrating skate brand Fucking Awesome. Offered in four exclusive colorways like \"Lucky Orange\" and \"Chalk Purple\", the all-black sole is added for extra eye-catching contrast all finished off with a golden 'Fucking Awesome' badge. To go alongside with the collection, adidas Skateboarding tapped animator Johannes Gamble in creating a claymation visual coinciding with the launch. The short film, featuring Fucking Awesome's Jason Dill, explores a fantastical, childlike process behind the design of the exclusive silhouette. The collection retails for $110 USD and is set to drop September 21st at 11 AM PST in-store at Fucking Awesome at 6556 Hollywood Blvd., Los Angeles, CA. Limited pairs will then become available online from 6 PM PST. \n",

      "Lazoschmidl’s FW19 collection marked their first show in Paris and drew concepts from a fictional sci-fi B-movie: “Thunder without rain. The air sweltry, sticky, salty… Back in their tents, inquisitorial humans prepare for the diplomats’ reception with the promiscuous alien race, bulging with stamina and erotic excitement.” \n",
      "The collection exhibited beaded mesh, lurex and see-through garments, as well as patterned prints on bright and pastel colors. The pieces represent Lazoschmidl’s continuous defiance against gender stereotypes through revisions of womenswear for men. \n",
      "Lazoschmidl offers many points of differentiation as a brand. Founded by Swedish-German designers Josef Lazo and Andreas Schmidl, the brand began by creating made-to-order pieces for clients and declined offers from various retailers before finally turning to Opening Ceremony. Lazoschmidl is an interdisciplinary pursuit combining fashion, design, and literature, as each collection is prefaced with a descriptive text outlining every look. Instead of creating lookbooks, exclusive fanzines specific to each collection are released in limited quantities. \n",
      "During a time when the industry is witnessing an increase in gender-agnostic clothing, Lazoschmidl’s widespread appeal demonstrates that their designs are “for the new human who is defined by their mindset and aesthetics – not race, age or gender.” \n",

      " Following local dissatisfaction, were the tagger's actions activism, or petty crime? Following local dissatisfaction, were the tagger's actions activism, or petty crime? Text: Julian Wright The Louis Vuitton pop-up in New York City closed its doors for good yesterday. Its neon shell still sits on Ludlow Street in the Lower East Side, almost eulogizing the store's 10-day existence. Most residents of the area are happy to see the all-green shop leave the area, but one local even went as far as making the pop-up a little less green, tagging it two days before its closure. The tag didn't have any particular message, but maybe the act was note enough: these people didn't want this pop-up near their homes. There are a few associated issues with pop-ups like the one from Louis Vuitton. Stores are disruptively placed in the middle of residential areas. Their presence sets up problems for residents, whose already-crowded neighborhoods get flooded with clout-seekers and tourists. Local businesses suffer, too. There's only so much in the pie of commerce; notable names like Louis Vuitton can steal pretty big pieces of it. Putting luxury stores in low-income neighborhoods also raises concerns about the quickening tide of gentrification. But just cause these larger problems surround this pop-up doesn't mean they were the motivations behind the tag. After all, the store was located in Hell Square, one of NYC's notorious crime spots. Whether you think the tagger's actions were activism or petty crime, the Louis Vuitton pop-up doesn't have to worry about graffiti anymore. It's now gone, and its bothersome attributes along with it. \n",

      "Raf Simons doesn’t like America. That’s widely known, but the designer’s return to his homeland in Belgium has left him with a seemingly different kind of vengeance for the States. \n",
      "As always, 51 year-old Simons geared his Spring Summer 2020 collection toward one audience and one audience only: the youth—a generation fed up with the corporate monster, Trump era politics and frankly, old people. \n",
      "Simons’ designs certainly made a statement. Simons, however, did not, declining to answer any questions after his show at Paris Fashion Week Men’s. Despite some cryptic phrases and his lack of clarification, Simons’ intentions for the collection ring loud and clear when pieced together as a whole. \n",
      "Some of the motifs stitched across his garments included “STONE(D) AMERICA,” “MY OWN PRIVATE ANTWERP” and “HOW TO TEXT YOUR TEEN.” As witty and, in some cases, funny as the sayings were, they were no joke to Simons. The short quips were blunt reminders of how out of touch the world, America, and older generations can be. \n",
      "Simons created an almost apathetic, desensitized environment by sending his models down the runway in lab coats, mid-calf rubber boots and oversized rubber gloves. The evil scientist aesthetic coupled with young models resulted in an even more demented showing. \n",
      "David Bowie’s “This Is Not America” opened the show, followed by a voice saying, “big lie, corporate America, fascist America” and so on. Simons’ pointedness is something that all youth, Americans included, can sympathize with, making this collection a win in his book. Raf Simons: 1, America: 0. \n",

      " Forever Guilty for not giving a f*ck, V chat with Jared Leto on all the indulgences. Forever Guilty for not giving a f*ck, V chat with Jared Leto on all the indulgences. Text: Stella Pak Jared Leto is the embodiment of the non-conforming Gucci Guilty Pour Homme. At first spray, scents of spicy pepper greet you with a hit that opens up to a refreshing zest for life. Traditionally used to evoke romance and innocence for female fragrances, Orange Blossom Absolute is used at the heart much like the essence of Leto's mature, yet young soul. Starring alongside Lana Del Rey in the latest Gucci Guilty fragrance campaign lensed by Glen Luchford, Jared Leto plays a free spirit in a quintessential Gucci fantasy, wandering through scenes of Los Angeles where Courtney Love makes a cameo appearance as a waitress in a glammed out diner. From cupcakes and music to the hustle and what’s ahead, V chat with Jared Leto and all things Guilty. The Gucci Guilty campaign reveals a sense of liberation, self-expression, fun and fearlessness but the fragrance name is Guilty. Have you ever felt guilty for just being yourself? I’d like to say no, because I feel like that’s kind of cosmological to feel guilty for just being yourself. And I think that so much of what we all fight for and the world is to create a place where we have the ability to be who you are and for that to be okay. I think the term “Guilty” and this (campaign) institutes a more playful take on the word. You know, as in a guilty pleasure. I think that’s fun you know? We all know that eating a cupcake is probably not a good idea because you want to take care of yourself, your body, and your mind. Sugar is a pretty nasty drug but sometimes it’s nice to just plow into it and treat yourself to eating a cupcake and see what you’re made of. That’s a nice thing – to have some guilty pleasure in your life, have some balance and for it to be okay. But what do I know? What are some of your indulgences? This is going to sound weird, but I kind of indulge into work quite a bit. And it is an indulgence. I don’t have a family. So, I can take that time and energy, and I can put it toward work and be probably a little more selfish with my creative life and my work life than if I had commitments and obligations to other people. So, it is a bit of an indulgence to have the ability to do that. Other than that, I like to spend time outdoors and in nature when I can indulge in that whenever possible. That’s a nice balance. You’re also a musician, so I have to ask if you were to translate the scent of Gucci Guilty sonically, what would it sound like? Maybe we would choose an old analog synthesizer, some big system I think would be really interesting because of the flexibility and variety that we get from that piece of technology. What are some scents that comfort you? I think the smell of fireplaces is always really comforting and beautiful. A primal smell. When your mom makes cookies, that’s always very hard to beat. Men’s fashion is having such a huge moment. You’re never afraid to experiment with your looks throughout the years. Do you feel like you take on a character when you put on an outfit? How do you become a chameleon of these looks? I appreciate that. I mean part of it is pretty much not giving a f*ck. You know for me and to the V readers, who gives a f*ck? It’s just a piece of fabric right? I think that there’s a little bit of that and just having a little bit of fun as well. That’s what I love about Gucci and Alessandro (Michele). They brought the fun back and kind of started a party over there. And everyone’s like, “Well that looks like a good time.” For me personally, I started to wear a lot of dresses recently on stage. Dresses. Yeah, I’ve been wearing dresses on stage for quite some time. And when I put them on, I don’t feel like I’m a character in them. I don’t even feel like I’m wearing a dress. Once you’re playing summertime shows outdoors, they’re better to run around in than like a muumuu or something. Haha. Just let the boys breathe! There’s a reason grandmas wear them, right? It feels more like a tunic and feels really pleasant to wear them, you know? It’s more of a bit of funkiness not just worn for me to run around on stage. It’s refreshingly and not too hot or restrictive. Well I guess that answers my next question, but what do you feel most comfortable in? Is it whatever in the moment? I’m comfortable with comfortable. I was putting something on last night and trying some stuff that Gucci came up with and whipped up. And when I put some stuff on, I’m just smiling and laughing, and you know, it’s kind of fun. I think that’s a determining factor for me. To just have some fun. I don’t really take it that serious. You’ve been a huge supporter of Alessandro (Michele) since he’s taken the helm at Gucci. Now your relationship has evolved and you’re really at the forefront of this Gucci gang. What is that relationship been like with Alessandro? It’s been great. It’s been wonderful. It’s awesome to work with your friends. The best thing about Alessandro besides his talent is his heart. And he’s a really kind, thoughtful person. He’s one of a kind and we’ve had a lot of fun with each other and I think we really like the fact that we get to work with each other. It’s just kind of a bonus, you know? It’s rare when it feels like work and we’re just kind of having a blast. It’s always a unique experience. Do you have any new projects that you have coming up that you can tell us about? I guess just wrapping up the tour this year. We’ve played about 110 - 115 shows all over the world and just got home about a week and a half ago so I’m really happy to be in one place. We’ve been all over the world multiple times and we’re actually having a summertime festival tour. But I’m going off to shoot a movie called Morbius, and then Warhol. So, yeah that’s my next year. Busy, busy. We’re looking forward to it. It’s always a pleasure to see you on screen, off screen, and to hear your music. Thanks for the chat. My pleasure. I’ll see you soon, I hope. \n",

Following his crystal-coated Louis Vuitton hoodie moment in London last week, the actor kicked things up a notch at a promotional event in Busan, South Korea wearing unique splatter-painted denim overalls by a double-threat artist and designer who has already worked with all your top fashion favorites. The entire ensemble was from S.R. STUDIO. LA. CA. owned and directed by American artist Sterling Ruby who views his clothing pieces similar to his art producing one-of-a-kind creations that mimic his artistic style. Previously, Sterling has worked alongside Raf Simmons with his tenures at Dior and Calvin Klein creating prints for dressmaking and designing the interior of flagship stores. In terms of the look, Chalamet opted for a double-dose of multicolored denim in overalls and a button-down that appeared acid-washed then dyed. Sterling even designed his footwear for the night featuring a chunky ankle-length white lug sole rain boot. The whole look proved to be a statement by Chalamet who has continued to develop his on-point style leaving everyone to wonder what he'll wear next. \n",

After last year's more serious theme Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination, it was a shift to see something more playful and fun, such as a pink red carpet subbing in for the classic scarlet hue on the steps, and kitschy flower sculptures upon entering. \n",
      "With so much press attention, the annual Met Gala is one of the biggest nights in fashion, and the boys brought their A-game. Stars played with gender, tailoring, glitter, tulle, jewels, makeup and dandyism. Looks ranged from sheer tailoring to bejeweled corsets, embroidered pink suits and sparkling tuxedos. The boys definitely stepped up to the plate for the 'camp' theme. \n",

Text: Nicole Territo It’s no understatement to say that industry has contributed mightily to the constellation of climate-related issues facing Planet Earth today. But fashion is one industry making material changes to both their manufacturing and marketing practices, increasingly relying on sustainable sourcing and eco-friendly initiatives, as the recent occasion of World Oceans Day helped illustrate. Italian brand Etro is one that dove headlong into the ocean-related festivities, releasing a down jacket made from approximately 120 recycled PET plastic bottles. The #ForTheOceans down jacket, designed by longtime menswear creative director Kean Etro, reflects both heritage craftsmanship techniques and alternative resources; in addition to the recycled PET, which has dramatically impacted our underwater ecosystems (estimates say that by 2050, the ocean will contain more plastic than fish), the jackets feature a sustainable, Italian-made polyester called New Life Yarn, which saves 32% of CO2, 94% of the water and 60% of the electric power used in traditional polyester. And thanks to the model’s use of an alternative, down-like padding, the comfortable, aqua-inspired coat makes the perfect outerwear piece to wear all winter, giving new meaning to the term “reuse.” \n",

      "The Love Ball has a rich history in New York City. Susanne Bartsch, the famed event producer, threw two iterations of the Love Ball in 1989 and 1991 as fundraisers for HIV/AIDS. She is teaming up with CDFA to put on an even bigger, third version of the spectacle in time for the 30th anniversary of her event. Nearing the celebration, Raul Lopez, designer of LUAR, created a custom t-shirt in honor of Love Ball III in partnership with the Phluid Project. \n",
      "Lopez was very drawn to the cause from his own AIDS-related loss: his uncle passed away during the AIDS epidemic. The shirt was inspired by those people who succumbed, featuring a sacred heart and angels as “a kind of representation of them.” To promote the shirt, a series of photos were taken of LGTQI+ influencers, ranging from drag queens to activists, all modeling the shirt. Notable faces on set included Desmond Is Amazing, Ezra J William, and Jacob Tobia, among many more. All proceeds from the shirt benefit the CFDA/Vogue HIV/AIDS Fund. \n",

Moncler released their collaboration with Hiroshi Fujiwara for the seventh chapter of the Genius Project. Text: Cullen Ormond October 3 marks the unveiling of “The Next Chapter” of Moncler’s Genius Project that was launched in 2018. The venture allows different creatives to put their mark on the classic Moncler designs. The seventh installment, dropped today, is a collaboration between Japanese musician and founder of fragment design, Hiroshi Fujiwara. Fujiwara is also referred to as the godfather of street fashion. In the eighties, he traveled to New York where he was introduced to hip-hop music and fashion. He brought these influences back to Japan and is credited with popularizing the genre and style. The pieces in the collection are the embodiment of Fujiwara’s futuristic and military-esque style. But, they are also made with light fabrics that emphasize fluidity and movement. Whether it’s the green bomber jacket or the bright orange parka with chunky white letters spelling “MONCLER FRAGMENT” on the back, even the athleisure tracksuit—the collection has something for everyone. Accompanying the launch of the collection was a brief film that encapsulates the essence of the clothing. Follow the two main characters, clad in the orange parka and a long, industrial style jacket through a futuristic labyrinth of wonder and metallic color. \n",

Prioritizing technical utility and practicality over the typical glamorous (and often unsustainable) trappings of typical NYFW presentations, the forward-thinking collection is a response to the imminent threat of climate change, because after all, in the words of designer Luka Sabbat, “If it comes down to the world burning down, who gives a shit about a pair of jeans that looks cool?” On display in Milk Gallery in Chelsea, the 4-piece concept collection was created in a collaboration by Luka Sabbat, Milk Studios, and The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC). Fashion essentials were designed to adapt to the current climate change threats —prototypes included headphones to combat heat waves and extreme storms, a jacket to combat infectious diseases, a bandana to combat air pollution, and a backpack to support environmental refugees. “Luka, Milk and the Natural Resource Defense Council have come together to put a face and a name to the challenges we’re facing and make the changes to save our planet,” said Mazdack Rassi, Milk’s co-founder. “The exhibition is a part of that story and a part of your story.” “The approach of it is less of an aesthetic design or trying to make it look as cool as possible, I looked at it more from a technical standpoint than a fashion standpoint,” said Sabbat in a video about the project. “There’s more money in destroying the environment than keeping it the way it is.” Having officially launched over the weekend alongside a microsite with a pledge to take personal climate action this 2019, the exhibition is now open for public viewing at Milk Gallery until February 14th. \n",

It’s that time of year again when most people dread exchanging their lighter yet stylish outerwear for their durable, less fashionable gear.  On November 29, which is the launch date for the collection, outerwear will be redefined. The emphasis is all things leather: a leather baseball jersey, a leather anorak with a removable hood, a leather duffle bag, just to name a few. But there is also an emphasis on gold exemplified in the 14K gold ring embossed with the “Nike” logo.   All of the products will be available in Supreme stores and online at 3:30 p.m. on November 29 and will be available in Japan on November 30. With the holidays right around the corner and as the winter chill sets in, this is the perfect time to snag a gift for the special someone – even if that special someone happens to be yourself.  This collaboration comes swiftly after the release (November 23) of Supreme’s Vol 2. 351-page monograph archiving the brand’s work from 2010 to 2018. \n",

But most importantly, people of all ages walk the street in glee, transformed with a completely different identity for the night. Halloween is a time for exploration and expression. It’s the one day of the year where you’re allowed to dress up as a completely different person and live vicariously through an entirely altered appearance. While it can be very difficult to hone in on the look you want to commit to, the final result is always worth the hassle. It’s even more fun to see those in the spotlight take on an alter ego for the night. Going to extravagant extents, celebrities have set the bar high for their costume expectations, and this year’s batch was nothing short of thrilling. Below, we’ve selected our favorite celebrity men’s Halloween looks of 2019: Rickey Thompson as Neo from The Matrix:   Rickey Thompson certainly did not come to play this Halloween season. Dressed in all black attire with Neo’s signature sunglasses and trench, Thompson is sending full Matrix energy. Russell Willson as Jay-Z with Ciara as Beyonce:   Alongside his wife Ciara dressed as Beyonce, Seahawks quarterback Russell Willson mimicked the style of Jay-Z in all of its bright blue glory. Fully committed, the married couple pulled off “Jay & Bey” to a tee. Liam Payne as Clark Kent:   With his shirt ripped open exposing his Superman chest, Liam Payne perfectly executed this classic Halloween look. The “Strip That Down” singer performed at the Kiss Haunted Show in full Clark Kent attire appearing fiercely heroic. Patrick Schwarzenegger as Austin Powers with Abby Champion as Fembot:  With his girlfriend Abby Champion dressed as Fembot, Patrick Schwarzenegger showed out in full Austin Powers style and attitude. Although he was impersonating the fictional spy, Schwarzenegger certainly did not manage to stay under cover as this creative couple’s costume garnered major attention. G-Eazy as Rockabilly Frankenstein  With a full green face and a screw jabbing into his neck, G-Eazy nailed his Rockabilly Frankenstein costume. The varsity jacket and cuffed jeans complete the ensemble reminiscent of the iconic fictional figure. Wiz Khalifa as Karate Kid:  Wiz Khalifa kept it simple in a white karate robe and blue belt. In a crowd of costume partygoers, the rapper appears ready to pull a punch at any given moment. Justin Timberlake as a microphone with Jessica Biel as Justin Timberlake:   Jessica Biel dressed up as her singing-songwriting husband Justin Timberlake, while he complemented her complete NSYNC fit dressed as a microphone. Their commitment is uncanny and so completely appreciated. Evan Peters as Sonny with Halsey as Cher:   Evan Peters and Halsey imitated the legendary American rock duo Sonny & Cher for their Halloween couple moment.

Text: Zoe Elefterin With men's fashion month well underway, the styles coming out of Italy right now are blowing us away. Central to it all is Pitti Uomo, the bi-annual Florence-based trade show is amongst the best events to catch some of the most formidable menswear around. Exhibitors come from all over the world, and this year, 1,230 different brands participated in the event. Located at the Fortezza da Basso, the historic fourteenth century fort has been home to the trade show for nearly 50 years. Raffaello Napoleone, the CEO of Pitti Imagine and also one of its founders, caught up with V about the legacy that their event has created and how things have changed. “The shows started in 1972. [It was] ninety percent formal wear, and then we understood that the market was changing.” Throughout the years, the street style has become central to the experience at Pitti Uomo. Looking at the street style at this year’s event, the influence of streetwear has had obvious international reach. You’ll see a lot more sneakers and sportswear these days. When Napoleone is asked how much things has changed, he humbly answers: “Dramatically.” From the business side of things, to how much menswear has evolved, Napoleone seems to be pleased with the direction in which things are going. In an interview with Fashion Insiders, he expressed that “We work with visionaries. They represent the trends of the future. We shouldn’t forget [that] fashion is the fastest-paced and most creative industry in today’s world.” \n",

      "Canali’s spring/summer 2020 debut came in two decidedly disparate installments. One presented inside the historic Palazzo Ximènes during menswear trade show Pitti Uomo, while the other showed at the brand's Milan showroom, and the two segments each lend themselves to an idyllic summer of leisure, despite their obvious differences. \n",
      "The first installment married formalwear with the casual spirit of the Italian summer. Set up as a mise-en-scène layout, the label’s models preoccupied themselves with games of chess, recent literature, Canali bicycles and friendly croquet matches. The presentation told a story of chic Italian gentlemen content in their tranquil and undisturbed state. \n",
      "The clothing told the same story. Lightweight fabrics formed soft silhouettes. Linen blend jackets were worn atop tightly tailored pants. Tone-on-tone neutrals were interspersed with muted red and hunter green tones, Canali’s color of choice for the season, sometimes paired together and other times as a monochrome look. In one ensemble, green slacks were topped by a long sleeve green jacquard knit, the latter of which made common appearances despite being a spring/summer collection. The knits either came as full-on sweaters or short sleeve polos. Another unexpected but delightful surprise was the presence of neck scarves, which added a touch of sophistication to the casual but undeniably sharp line. \n",
      "The second installment, labeled the Black Edition, pushed Canali in a seemingly new direction: performancewear. Active is to lounge as black is to white, yet somehow, they almost always come hand-in-hand. Such is the case here. Canali’s active/loungewear came in these two shades alone, save the occasional grey number. High-performance athletic fabric was outfitted as sweats, t-shirts, tracksuits, and hooded jackets. Semi-sheer coats and mesh panels covered t-shirts and hoodies emblazoned with a graphic rendition of Canali’s name. The line, which will formally debut this week at Milan Fashion Week Men’s, signals a new course for Canali. \n",

      "Seven Crash debuted its Fall Winter 2019 collection in classic streetwear style—with a sustainable twist. The inspiration for the futuristic collection stemmed from a space explorer aesthetic, incorporating metallic, innovative fabric choices throughout the show. In partnership with BASF, a German chemical company, the streetwear brand was able to create a collection that is not only sustainable but also embodies their goal of creating \"futuristic workwear.\" Every piece is designed with both fashion and function in mind, creating a look that withstands the elements. The color palette for the collection consists of neon dayglow accents, out-of-this-world metallics, and pops of vibrant red and yellow. \n",
      "“Seven Crash is looking forward to presenting our highly innovative and fashion-forward streetwear brand to the US and international press for the first time during New York Fashion Week. Our partnership with BASF allows Seven Crash to be leading the pack in offering our customers great streetwear style in new and sustainable fabrications.” \n",
      "This function-driven collection embodies the future of Fashion Week and Ready-to-Wear styles: a push towards forward-thinking, sustainable fashions that push the envelope of what has come to be expected from a new brand.

Virgil made his Louis Vuitton debut at Paris Men’s Fashion week with a star studded runway featuring Steve Lacy and Kid Cudi, just to name a few. Hedi Slimane taking over the iconic house of Céline may have been controversial in his decision to remove the brand's signature accent aigu, thankfully, Slimane's Celine did give us all what we've wanted from the brand; Menswear! And we must say, it was worth the wait. \n",
      "Moving on, we also had the initiation of Margiela's iconic Tabi boot into the menswear arena, available to the boys in different color ways and styles. There have been clear standouts in mens fashion, but a few notable contenders that typically fly under the radar garnered some attention for their unexpected influence to style. These fellas include some unassuming characters, Ross Lynch and Shia Lebouf to name a few, but we have to say that while their effortless looks may have not garnered them \"Best Dressed\" status, they've earned place on our mood boards.             \n",

      "Fashion historians may remember 2018 as the year that menswear made noise. While the template for men's formalwear, the tuxedo, has essentially gone unchanged since coattails went out of style, both creators and consumers of menswear have lately embraced a culture of experimentation—as seen in the leadership shuffle at top houses like Louis Vuitton and Dior, and on the red carpet, where black-tie conservatism has given way to sartorial risk-taking among men. From heeled boots to dress shorts to pink suits, here are the men's fashion moments that pulled the most focus from the usual tide of evening gowns (and made the most headlines) in 2018. \n",

      "The now ubiquitous distribution model of fashion-as-merch—rogue capsule collections, lines around the block, high demand and limited supply—can arguably be traced back to Supreme, the streetwear brand founded by recent CFDA winner James Jebbia in 1998. While its hard to quantify Supreme's impact on fashion, art and commerce, one metric might be an ongoing online auction at Sotheby's—comprised not of Supreme clothing, but of skate decks created in concert with various visual artists. The lots, which belong a single collector named Ryan Fuller, reflect the only complete collection of the brand's 248 skate decks, and further evidence that Supreme's collectibles-based business model is far more than a fad. \n",
      "Estimated to fetch between $800,000 and $1.2 million, the auction ranges from relatively recent drops like the Louis Vuitton x Supreme Fall/Winter 2017 capsule, to more obscure items like the \"Unauthorized and Recalled Logo Set\" from 2000 and the \"Jesus Deck,\" released only in Japan. Artist collaborators include KAWS, Takashi Murakami and Richard Prince—many of whom continue to loom large in the art-meets-fashion economy (see: KAWS at Dior Men). While a bid might cost you a pretty penny, placing one is just a click away—which sure beats waiting for hours on the sidewalk. The online-only auction runs until January 25. \n",

      "The Goethe-Institut Paris is probably the last place you'd expect to see an American high school reunion. But thanks to Lazoschmidl and their SS20 collection last week, it felt as though you could have seen something similar. Playing on the stereotypical profiles of high school, the Swedish-German designer duo sought out to rattle our notions of teenage socialization. Jocks, nerds, bad boys: it was these groups that Lazoschmidl chose to simultaneously portray and rebel against. \n",
      "The looks, though they channeled high school energy, felt more sexed-up and theatrical than one would see there. The garments were tight, thin and translucent. Most covered a large majority of the body, but Lazoschmidl's cuts and fabric choices left us seeing more than expected. Long-sleeved shirts still revealed lanky arms and visible midriffs underneath a thin layer of fabric. See-through pants showed long legs and models' briefs. Despite the amount of body and skin showing, the attention was on the clothing. The entire collection was bright. Bold prints, florals and pastel colors dominated throughout, adding a retro feel to the runway. Much like the personas the garments portrayed, the fabrics felt like the reimagination of objects from yesteryear. When looking at its entirety, the way the collection characterized the figures of high school was pretty obvious. Jocks wore varsity jackets, tanks and track shorts. Geeks wore collars and glasses. We even saw fringed sashes for prom kings. Lazoschmidl SS20 played on what we knew and disrupted it with a twist we surely wouldn't miss. \n",

      "The two designers of Cottweiler, Matthew Dainty and Ben Cottrell, named their FW19 collection, “The Lost Art of Cruising”, an activity deeply based in the physical and public realm, and a verb that rings back to times sans internet. It was the pursuit of intimacy by gay people, without apps or direct messages.The location of the show–a 12-story-deep cement parking lot, flashed back to common cruising locations. \n",
      "Large, stone-like urinals presented themselves as the initial statement of the show. Covered in unattractive sludge-like moss with water sprouting out of them, there is a reference to Marcel Duchamp, the artist who notoriously named a urinal “Fountain” and called it art in 1917. The urinal-as-art calls back to a time of transformation, an upheaval in the time of tradition, a concept that certainly felt present in this collection.  \n",
      "Of course, there were references to gay culture, with towels attached to belts, dog leashes without dogs, and luxurious transparent shirts. The clothing felt interestingly in tune with earth shades of greens and blues with organic patterns that had a certain nature-taking-back-the-earth vibe which felt like the perfect place for humanity and sexuality to exist in peace. Noteworthy moments included Reebok sneaker/loafer hybrids, a collaboration with Italian outerwear brand, Allegri, who created some gorgeous raincoats, and a hand-dyed olive green coat complete with three zippers and a flash of skin. \n",

Fendi has launched a few capsule collections lately, but its capsule with Jackson Wang is its first with the Chinese brand ambassador. Text: Julian Wright It was only January when Fendi announced Jackson Wang as its brand ambassador for China. Fendi described Wang, a member of k-pop group Got7, as \"perfectly connected\" to its spirit. With a comment like that, it only makes sense that the two would eventually collaborate creatively. It didn't take long: Fendi launched its capsule collection with the singer on Friday. This marks its first collection with Wang, one in a long series of millennial-friendly capsules from the fashion house. Wang's personal style acted as the main inspiration for the collection: sleek, slender, and street-ready. The designs have one obvious joining feature: every garment is black. The collection includes jumpers, running sneakers, T-shirts, a suit, a baguette bag and a \"Fendi Team Wang\"-plated cap. Black velvet and chenille are the principal materials, with a few exceptions like the leather bag. In a time when streetwear is taking over, capsule collections allow brands like Fendi to experiment and innovate. Serge Brunschwig, Fendi's CEO, said, “Capsules are always a way to collaborate in unexpected and new ways - the idea is super interesting.” With Fendi's growing partnership with Jackson Wang, we'd have to agree. \n",

And for a good reason—during the Fast Company Innovation Festival, Kanye West and YEEZY head sneaker designer Steven Smith have announced that the brand is going to be “farming and going seed to sole”, making its Foam Runner clog-style shoe out of seaweed-like algae. For YEEZY, this move is a sustainability initiative that will help clean waterways to protect wildlife and drinking water while eliminating fossil fuels commonly used in the traditional production of foam. “Eco-concerns are intersecting with what we do, this is just the beginning of the future that Kanye envisioned for us to start working on,” Smith shared. Kanye added that the company is currently working on finding alternatives to harmful dyes and that the Foam Runner prototype in his hands was made inside the U.S., in Atlanta.

An influential week in the world of fashion, the Italian organization behind it all fosters creativity by providing smaller brands a platform to prove their worth in an industry bursting at the seams with talent. A combination of well-established professionals and new designers come together to learn, grow, and ultimately, show us what they’re made of.

The show includes a “weather room”, allowing viewers to immerse themselves in a frozen experience that ties into the cold-braving wares of the Woolrich collection.

Haculla Haculla is a brand inspired by the street art culture of NYC.

For SS20, Ermenegildo Zegna similarly showcased in a former industrial park in Milan. Peculiar to most, Sartori's choice again had intention. He said about his setting to WWD, \"...what a place meant in the past continues to live in the present and will continue to live in the future with a different soul.\" The industrial complex allowed Ermenegildo Zegna to follow its show's tagline, \"Use the Existing.\" \n",
      "But it didn't just stop there: the clothes walked also followed the show's mantra. When you glance over the collection, nothing feels utterly revolutionary or never-before-seen. It was practical essentials and classic menswear pieces, one after the other. The trick to Ermenegildo Zegna SS20 was consistency. It drew upon the existing fashion staples and adapted them for the modern man. There was the brand's bread-and-butter tailoring, of course, but the way it was presented felt new. Sheeny fabrics, an embrace of color and patterns, and a multitude of complementary accessories gave the show freshness. The sophistication we expect from Ermenegildo Zegna was ever-present, but now, it was elevated by seemingly incremental innovations of past products. Sartori was just using what already existed, but he made it better.  \n",

Photography: Fujio Emura Text: SAMUEL ANDERSON Like a beautiful yet devastatingly indifferent couch-surfer, this year’s New York Fashion Week: Men’s came and slinked away in all of 72 hours. Despite an abridged lineup, largely due to a creative exodus affecting NYFW at large, the men’s labels who stayed local elicited lingering feelings of discovery and spontaneity. These notes were thick in the air at the Linder headquarters on Wednesday night, adding to the humidity and preppy nonchalance, when menswear creative director Kirk Millar showed his SS20 collection. With the class-conscious family portraiture of Thomas Struth and Tina Barney as the collection's springboard, the brand’s tony East Village townhouse provided an apt backdrop for Millar’s gang of models, densely assembled in a parlor fashioned as a bedroom-like domain of privileged adolescence. “The Playstation and TV belong to my friend Dane, one of the models in the show; he plays a lot,” says Millar of the tableau. “I think the video games, for me, are more about escapism and entering into a different world. And fashion has been that [to me] since I was a teenager.” With “trophy husband”-emblazoned polos and “boyfriend” socks unassumingly slipped into loafers, Millar seemed to use fashion as a subversion tactic, whether against country-club dress codes or sexual normativity. “Ideas of love and connection have [existed] throughout [my collections],” he says. “My first collection was about coming out, [whereas] this collection is more eclectic; people ask, ‘Do you want to be a trophy husband or have one? And I’m like... [shrugs].”  Millar describes Spring/Summer as an appeal to the private desires of the proverbial black sheep, one inspired by his own dueling attractions. “The character I wanted to push into the collection was this sensitive, dorky [guy] who doesn’t quite fit the mold of what [he was] born into,” says Millar. “Which is very much the opposite of how I grew up, in a small town in Arizona, but is a character [I’ve] run into a lot in New York; friends, or whoever, that were all years ahead of me in terms of the culture they’d consumed.” On the cusp of his 10-years-in-the-city milestone, Millar expresses disappointment at the tide of designers decamping to European fashion weeks. “I think the industry is trying to chase things down instead of hanging in there... Is that mean of me to say? [laughs]” wagers Millar. “The creativity that New York fosters is unlike any other, so it’s kind of a shame that New York is treated like a stepchild of other fashion weeks, when it used to be the best. And will be the best again, in my opinion.\" In this exclusive, VMAN takes an intimate portrait of Linder’s latest offspring. \n",

He now sports a head full of ashy, blonde-ish, blue-purple locks. The appointment was bitter-sweet. “My hairdresser, he’s a lovely guy named Charles,” Howarth, better known as Perto, said. “And I just found out that it’s the last time he’ll cut my hair today because he’s moving to Vancouver, and I’m really sad. It sucks, I don’t know what to do.”  This 17 year-old—half-amused, half-distressed by the uncertain fate of his hair—is the very same boy whose bio reads, “bowl cut baby.” That bio appears on the website of his management company. The L.A.-based group boasts a roster of big-time EDM DJs including Skrillex and Zedd. And now, on the homepage of their website, right in front of those two multi-platinum artists, is the scrawly logo of Perto.  The Sydney native doesn’t lead an average teenage life. Just halfway through high school, Perto traded homework and classrooms for sound systems and concert venues. Still, the young DJ lives in the same home with his parents and identical twin brother. Only so much can change when you’re still underage.  Before Perto caught the attention of top industry players, he was just a kid enjoying good music like the rest of us. But, as many artists do, he had an ah-ha moment—one that led to a story so well-rounded and wholesome it’s almost envious.  “I was in the car with my mom and I heard a Skrillex song on the radio and I freaked out ’cause I had never heard anything like that before,” Perto said. “From that day forward, that’s when I cracked Ableton.”  The song was “Bangarang” and it led a young, 10-year-old Rupert to start learning the production software, eventually attending production school for a year. Still a tween, the youngster began crafting music and uploading it to Soundcloud.  “I started making really, really shitty EDM like everyone does,” Perto said. “For music producers, I think that’s how most people start nowadays. I didn’t really like my music until last year.” Perto sent those “shitty” demos to anyone he could. The producer joked that he probably even sent some to his current management company back in the day.  Back in Sydney, Perto was seeking out local gigs, eventually landing a slot at The Wall. The fan-based nightclub with a cult following hosted the DJ’s first-ever live show. The performance went semi-viral, leading to a string of bookings. Singer and producer Enschway was Perto’s music godfather in all of this, helping the young prodigy navigate the thrilling and sometimes confusing waters of the music industry. Enschway was a recipient of one of those cold-emails that Perto sent asking for feedback.  Years after Perto was brought onstage at a Major Lazer show for repping the group's merch, fulfilling a musical dream and perhaps igniting his love for fashion, Diplo came back to Australia. This time, Post Malone was his opening act. Naturally, Perto went to the show in Sydney.  “I waited outside of the venue with a bunch of USBs, and Post’s team pulled up,” Perto said. “I was like, ‘oh fuck, this is probably going to be my only chance.’ So, I went up and said, ‘hey, I don’t want to bother you,’ but I handed him a USB and was like, ‘can you please give that a listen?’ Next morning, Diplo followed me on Instagram.” Diplo, a three-time Grammy winner with five Billboard Hot 100 hits, has since worked with Perto in the studio, collaborating on a number of tracks, though there are no plans to release anything at the time.  Earlier this year, Perto finally met the producer who inspired it all: Skrillex. The two were introduced by Diablo and Whethan—both of whom Perto frequently collaborates with—after Skrillex’s set with Boys Noize as Dog Blood at Miami’s Ultra Music Festival.  The EDM kid-whiz had another star-studded weekend in Miami working with legendary producer Timbaland. During that week, Perto produced with anti-pop royal Billie Eilish and helped Timbaland work on content for Ludacris, Kanye West and Justin Timberlake. “It was the craziest week of my life. It was fucking insane,” Perto said. “I can’t say that there’s a record coming out, though—I don’t really know. But it was a great experience.” Most recently, Perto collaborated with New York-based Kah-Lo for their single “Bad Maybe Good,” which dropped last Friday. The track came together in a few short hours. “I think the best records I write happen super fast,” Perto said. “It’s just a very simple idea that comes out quickly and it’s natural and it’s organic. Those are the best ideas.” The song has already been added to full rotation on triple j, one of Australia’s biggest radio stations.  Quantity of content is no issue for the Australian DJ, who is sitting on a mountain of tracks. It’s finishing the pieces that presents the greatest challenge. He'll spend the rest of the year polishing some of these songs to be released as singles before gearing up to make an EP in 2020. The DJ is also preparing to play his first festival: Listen Out in Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Sydney, alongside dance-music heavyweights like Diplo, 6lack, and ScHoolboy Q. Big crowds don’t scare Perto. What does make him nervous, is being interviewed. “I’m not very good at talking about myself” he candidly confessed over breakfast, post-haircut. “It’s crazy for me to say that this is what I do for a living. I still don’t really believe it. I started learning how to DJ when I was 10. I fell into production and honestly, I just haven’t stopped.” That he hasn’t. If Perto keeps sprinting down his current path to EDM stardom, then there will be many more shows, many more records and, of course, many more interviews.  Listen to the DJ's latest single, \"Bad Maybe Good,\" with Kah-Lo below. \n",

Well, we may just have the answer for you. Today, Giorgio Armani Beauty named Golden Globe nominee Ryan Reynolds as the face of their Armani Code fragrance. Introduced in 2004, Armani code has since become one of the top male fragrances in the world. Embodying effortless seduction, Armani Code has found the perfect face to front the fragrance; and Giorgio Armani himself couldn’t agree more. “Ryan Reynolds perfectly embodies the modern sensuality of the Armani Code man: someone with charisma, authenticity, an effortless style, and the right dose of irony”, said Mr. Giorgio Armani. Shot by Matthew Brooks the first ad campaign starring Reynolds will also feature the newest addition to Giorgio Armani Fragrance family; Armani Code Absolu. The updated take on the original fragrance Armani Code is set to make it's first appearance beside Ryan Reynolds February of this year. Along with the release of the first ad campaign there will be an accompanying short film directed by Emmy award winning Reed Morano. Producing and starring in box office record breaking film “Deadpool” showed us all that he had the magic touch. With Ryan Reynolds fronting the fragrance Armani Code Absolu may just be liquid Gold.

Check out this French post-punk inspired campaign film for Hedi Slimane's first menswear collection as creative director of Celine. Text: Zoe Elefterin Celine without the accented “é” has no doubt made waves. We’ve already witnessed a full rebranding and recently, Celine announced that they’re joining Paris Men’s Fashion Week this January after Hedi Slimane declared that all Celine menswear will be marketed to both men and women. Now, the latest from Slimane’s Summer 19 Paris la Nuit collection has debuted in the form of a film. It features Celine’s Summer 19 collection in various rich black and white images shot by Slimane himself. The film shows structured and classic suit silhouettes, leather jackets, and funkily patterned jackets by Swiss-American artist Christian Marclay, all paired with dark, narrow sunglasses from Slimane’s inaugural collection. The two-channel video, accompanied by the obscure 1985 song, Polaroïd/Roman/Photo by French synth-pop duo, Ruth, flips through images on both sides, sometimes like a timer, and sometimes like a printed polaroid. It’s very simple, very mod, but nonetheless rock-n-roll in its mentality. Where there are references to television, sound, and reel-to-reel tape recorders, there are also the nods to sculpture, mirrors, and classic synthesizers that situate the collection in a dual 60's/80’s fantasy.  The Celine menswear Summer 19 collection will be available in stores for both men and women in February. See the campaign film below: \n",

After touring around the world, the Louis Vuitton pop-up, promoting the brand's FW19 collection, made a stop in NYC. Text: Julian Wright Over the last year, you may have seen a Louis Vuitton Pop-up emerge in a city near you. It started in London, then Shanghai, Tokyo, Beverly Hills, Chicago and now, the Big Apple. Promoting the fashion house's FW19 collection, this pop-up in Manhattan's Lower East Side is packed with familiar looks from the runway. The collection's Parisian debut setting inspired the pop-up's location, sharing a similar grungy, downtown aura. The brand's creative director, Virgil Abloh, guided this pop-up, making it one of special importance. Though the clothing is the store's focal point, the 6,000 square-foot destination is filled with one other thing: neon green. For real, everything is green. The exterior, the interior, the fixtures and even an all-green male figure sitting on an all-green couch. Even the mailbox and trash bags are that same acidic hue. The products being sold are the only objects with any other color. You can find sharp suits, monogrammed accessories, rainbow leather prints, and the updated version of the \"skate\" trainer from FW19 at this new locale. Whether you can afford Louis Vuitton or not, the company is selling an immersive experience for anyone and their Instagram to enjoy. The Louis Vuitton Pop-up Store is located at 100 Rivington St, New York, NY 10012. It will be running until July 21st. \n",

      "Fashion's fresh talents don't always start out as stars. So when a freshly graduated designer puts together a collection both subversive and timely in equal measure, they're an undisputed standout. Marvin Desroc master's collection presented this year at London's Central Saint Martins, was sported by mostly black models and offered a fascinating tension between the masculine and the feminine, with male musculature subtly outlined by fishnet tops, waists cinched by frills or capacious bows, and feet in lacy boots, bringing a fresh voice to the growing crop of designers un-gendering menswear. \n",
      "Intrigued, VMAN had a chat with this young French designer, whose fascinating exploration of his Caribbean heritage and gender roles make him an outright talent to watch. \n",
      "VMAN: Can you please introduce yourself? \n",
      "My name is Marvin Desroc, I’m 23 years old. I was born in Martinique and raised in Paris. \n",
      "VMAN: When did you realize that you wanted to become a fashion designer? \n",
      "It’s been a while now. My mom used to sew and make little African dresses as a side hustle growing up. The sound of the sewing machine is something I always knew and liked. \n",
      "VMAN: What shaped your vision as a fashion designer? \n",
      "Marvin Desroc: I would for sure say the people around me. I have fearless, black, queer friends around who inspire me every day, in everything they do. \n",
      "VMAN: Are there designers you particularly admire? \n",
      "MD: I like everyone. There’s always bits to like from all the greats. I respect anyone who has enough balls to do what we do and to let themselves be open to so much criticism. I love designers from Bob Mackie to McQueen. I’d say the ones that I can somehow relate to, as human beings, are Alaïa and Gaultier. They do hold a special place in my heart. \n",
      "VMAN: Can you tell us more about your own background and heritage? You've mentioned that people used to say you were an \"Oreo\". Can you please tell us more about it? \n",
      "MD: I was born in Fort-de-France. My father is from Martinique and my mother is from Dominica. I came to Paris when I was 4. I was the last of four children. I guess my Caribbean heritage wasn’t as present compared to my siblings, due to the fact that I left the island very young, and I received loads of slack for this. To top it off, I was very flamboyant...it just didn't help. Being criticized because you are deemed to have \"forgotten your roots\" was very hurtful. Foolishly, growing up I really didn’t give myself a chance to explore this side of me either. I later on did; and I’m still learning. \n",
      "VMAN: How do your origins shape your vision? \n",
      "MD: They always come into play, from the way I research to the actual result. An image means something when you incorporate your origins and your own experience to it. Otherwise it’s just fluff, another nice reference that everybody has. What’s important is what this image means to me and how it mirrors my own life experience. \n",
      "VMAN: How was it studying at Duperré? \n",
      "MD: It was ok. I was at such a different time in my life at this point, because I barely knew myself. I was so young. So it allowed me to make mistakes, explore what I could do creatively within a safe environment. I enjoyed it. \n",
      "VMAN: How was it studying at Saint Martins? \n",
      "MD: Saint Martin's was a different ball game. It was hard but definitely worth it. Everything I explored now had to be thought through again. I came in knowing myself better this time, but they even make you question that certainty, too. The Masters is truly an amazing program. It’s mentally challenging, in all aspects. \n",
      "VMAN: Your collection at Duperré was pretty focused on womenswear. And your CSM collection also had a lot of elements people would qualify as \"feminine\". Can you tell us more about your vision on the masculine/feminine debate? \n",
      "MD: I feel like it’s 2019, and people can do what they want. I’m inspired by my friends who still consider themselves masculine, but still won’t mind wearing a cute sexy female top to show off their body. I do that too, a lot! We do it because it’s fun, but mostly because it’s not that important. There’s an \"order\" that I believe people want to preserve. And this goes beyond sexuality, because even in the gay community, that debate is still there... I don’t think people are really ready, but when it comes to all this, I believe that this separation can be mended from time to time. And all these \"rules\" are definitely here to be challenged. Funny enough, time has proven that there has always been a fine line between the two. As we go along in history, what was considered masculine, for example, is now feminine... You never can win with that debate. It’s definitely a social construct that people need to just let go of. \n",
      "VMAN: How would you describe the collection you showed this year at Saint Martin's? What was the message? \n",
      "MD: I would describe it as elegant with a touch of softness; yet it feels quite strong at the same time. It was all based on my experience growing up. This feeling  of being \"caught in between\" two things; that idea of limbo. It's something that I carry with me all the time. Therefore, with this collection you're in between blackness/whiteness, masculinity/femininity, hard/soft...Within that a recurrent theme I'm tackling various issues that are dear to me. \n",
      "VMAN: There is a a whole new generation of black creatives emerging right now, (photographers, models, stylists, designers, etc.). How do you feel about this new wave? \n",
      "MD: I hate the word \"wave.\" I believe it shouldn’t be considered as just another trend. It’s something that has been happening for a long time; it’s not something new. People are somehow finally interested in hearing us. Does it have to continue? Absolutely! Is this something that should be considered normal now and should go beyond race? Yes! But other than that, I’m really happy to see this happening, because the power of representation is real. Thankfully, it can only be a great sign for future generations... because now they can see themselves in this industry thanks to those who are leading by example. \n",
      "VMAN: What are your plans for your brand? \n",
      "MD: I just want to create and inspire. The word \"brand\" is a word that introduces so many other aspects that I’m not particularly fan of in this industry. I’m more focused on clothes and the challenges that come with designing. That’s what I love to do! The plan is just to have fun and challenge people’s views through beauty. But most of all, grow. \n",
      "VMAN: Are you working on any projects at the moment? \n",
      "MD: I am. I’m always working otherwise I can’t function properly. But I believe in not saying anything before it is out. So bare with me. \n",

Text: SAMUEL ANDERSON It’s not every campaign film that sees a pair of models piloting a vintage Rolls-Royce through a stormy, CGI-inflected U.K. countryside, only to collide with a pile of lumber, thereby accessing a blazing portal to some supernatural great beyond. Such is the conceit dreamed up by British brand Represent for its Fall/Winter visuals, including a gritty fantasy starring poet Sonny Hall and model Mudi Sama. Maintaining the brand’s alt-aristocratic aesthetic, the campaign’s Highlands-meets-scorched-earth theme extends to the collection’s mix of cable-knit sweaters, tactical gear and graphic sweatshirts, as well as to the casting of Hall, a model-writer known for his lyrical takes on grief, apathy and addiction.  Leveraging youth-focused cache for timely purposes, Represent founders George and Mike Heaton say the film visualizes the U.K.'s current relationship with the European Union—a topical yet familiar struggle between establishment and uprising. “The campaign was shot in the great British outdoors of West Penine Moors in England, and we definitely wanted a British name to star and go with it,” they tell VMAN. “But we also wanted someone with that ‘rock-n-roll’ attitude, to bring the collection to life. We thought Sonny Hall was great for this, because, though not a musician, he used his life experience as [em]powerment.” No stranger to metaphor, Hall, a face of Burberry and fixture in the mad-tea-party-punk scene paved by Pete Doherty (whom he has called an influence), is known for his confessional poetic style, as recently showcased in his chapbook, The Blues Comes With Good News. Watch his latest hallucinatory mini-saga below.  \n",

      "Prada has been around since 1913, orchestrating industrywide trends throughout its storied, century-long history. Historically anchored in Italy, the fashion house made a telling debut of its new Spring/Summer menswear line in Shanghai, not Milan. This is a substantial change, and one that matches the thematics of the show. When asked about her first experience in China, creative director Miuccia Prada said in a statement, \"I was 25 years old, in the late Seventies.” She said, “The difference [between then and now], of course, is huge. Now it’s so modern but it’s so funny, when you go back to Italy, it’s like you go back to medieval times.\" \n",
      "With Prada SS2020, the renowned brand is seemingly focused on catering to this new modern. The clothing matched its creator's aim, renovating timeless essentials and retro motifs for confident contemporaries. The show made a point to highlight accessories and variable proportions, giving consumers the power to stylize their Prada pieces to their own taste. Necklines plunge to mid-chest and trousers vary in width. Oversized coats and baggy bombers layer untucked, sometimes fitted, collared shirts. Models walked down the runway in bolo ties, neck-wrapping bandanas and geometric glasses. Colors and prints brought a boldness to this collection, presenting pastels and old tech references. Think cassette tapes and floppy disks. \n",
      "The most striking feature of this collection is a power to choose. Stiff pants or billowing jackets, bright colors or muted earth tones and a gamut of necklines. Prada is giving men many options to play with. It has a new consumer in mind: a man with respect for fashion's history but a desire to add his own individualized contributions. \n",
      "The brand and its many years of shows are contributory to its showcased pieces' \"classic\" status. It's reminded of its influence with every feature of the garments. But with a younger generation and era of fashion before it, Prada redesigned these canonical pieces for a new world. Just like when she was 25, Miuccia Prada came to China this week in pursuit of the current. This time, she came prepared with a modernized version of her brand's legendary Italian roots. It's easy to mistake this collection as another attempt at the familiar. If you're seasoned Prada aficionado, you know it's nothing of the sort, but actually a look to the future. \n",

Text: Fred Sahai Ermenegildo Zegna has unveiled its inspiring Fall/Winter 2019 campaign, which features two-time Oscar winner Mahershala Ali and actor, martial artist, singer and chef Nicholas Tse. The “#WhatMakesAMan” explores the different definitions of masculinity, which is fluid like the world it lives in. The campaign presents itself as a sort of manifesto, proclaiming that masculinity cannot exist within a set of rules rather, it can be anything one makes of it. As we as a society have evolved to recognize qualities like coming to terms with inner weaknesses and strengths and embracing fragility, the men in the campaign show what it means to be a man and to be true to oneself. Zegna seeks to open a dialogue about what masculinity means to different men, inviting influential figures such as Ali and Tse into the conversation. These men both portray versatility in their careers and refuse to be defined, much like the modern man. Discover what being a man means to them below.    \n",

      "It was only 10 years ago that Massimo Giorgetti started MSGM. Since then, the label has built a name for itself, proliferating throughout the world with its stores. Its collections have had some trends over the years: bold prints, tailoring and a penchant for the contemporary. MSGM SS20 menswear was no different. \n",
      "Seriously, the show was nowhere near short of eye-catching prints. Tie-dye, bleached denim, bright red lobsters, multi-colored leopard, paisley, and maybe a few flowers. The garments were bold and confident, emitting assurance in patterns previously well-received. It was something we have come to expect from MSGM, and clearly a nod to the brand it's built for itself over the last decade. The brand even went back further, with some nineties nuances cropping up throughout the collection. Upon further inspection, it's obvious that the brand is doing more than looking back - it's also mapping out its future. The looks are geared towards street style, incorporating what we've come to know of MSGM with where fashion is headed. Giorgetti said of this collection to i-D, \"It’s a declaration of what MSGM is, and what fashion means to me right now.” The brand has every intention of being a part of that \"right now\". \n",
      "MSGM has always been about looking towards the future. After the show, Giorgetti said, \"It is ten years since I started, but this is just the beginning\". His eyes are on what is to come next. He recognizes it's important to commemorate the past, which MSGM did with SS20. But it's equally as important to strive to stay relevant. For a brand that is obsessed with the immediate, he is looking in the right direction.  \n",

      " In new web series, editor-turned-auteur Jacob Brown sheds light on industry realities. In new web series, editor-turned-auteur Jacob Brown sheds light on industry realities. Text: SAMUEL ANDERSON Company lore states that Jacob Brown, V and VMAN alumnus, once pitched a then-unknown downtown showgirl for coverage, thus laying track for her 2009 V debut. Like said subject, now universally known as Lady Gaga, Brown has evolved as an image-maker, eventually graduating from print media to the moving image. After harvesting his industry knowledge for a string of shorts, including his 2011 debut Blinders starring model Luke Worrall, Brown has continued to probe behind the curtain. For his new digital series, out today, the writer/director considers fashion's most notorious subaltern: the male model.  Created by Brown, Model Boy follows three fresh faces, played by real-life models Taylor Rosen (VNY), Stanley Simons (Next) and Phoenix Jakob (Click), as they strive to beat the business’s lopsided odds. “Labor economists have a very formal definition of what they call a ‘bad job,’ relating to wages, seasonal nature, unpredictability, lack of benefits [etc.],” Brown says. \"Economically [being a male model] is the only high prestige ‘bad job,’ quote unquote.” The story came to Brown while researching an ill-fated T Magazine feature on two seemingly high-flying talents, whom he’d followed to Milan castings. “One booked no shows at all and [the other] walked in one [because] he had a Prada exclusive,” he recalls. “So that kind of killed my piece, but I [realized] these guys' situation can get pretty fucked up and dramatic.”  While male models have long had the dubious distinction of earning significantly less than their female counterparts, Brown sees them as more than a wage-gap anomaly. “I see Model Boy as a feminist narrative transposed onto male bodies; these are young guys, new to New York, who are suddenly subject to the male gaze and dealing with the threat of sexual misbehavior,” he says. “These are things that of course women deal with constantly, at all times, but I think it’s interesting to see what happens when men and boys are put in that situation.”  Model Boy’s supporting players, including a queer it-photographer and a trans agent played by Victoria Beltran (Sex and the City 2), draw out the show's true-to-life, six-episode narrative. However fictional, the show serves as a multifaceted counter-portrait to the over-it, golden-boy archetype—one Brown suggests may contribute to ingrained power dynamics at play IRL. “[Models] were really excited [by the premise] and to audition, but I think that a lot of these guys, [after] work[ing] in the fashion industry, project a kind of nonchalance, I-don’t-care attitude, which is what people want in a male model,” says Brown. “But yeah, I think that the core theme of the show definitely resonated [because] behind closed doors it’s something they constantly talk about.”  Witness to his share of both success stories and hard truths, Brown remains a card-holding member of the fashion ecosystem, enlisting everyone from Opening Ceremony to CFDA on the production of Model Boy, which is stream-able on YouTube. “The show dovetails well with some of CFDA’s current initiatives around diversity and health and safety for models,” he says. “So they’re hoping to use the next season as a platform to be make [those initiatives] more inclusive of male models.” With the fuel of industry support and his second season mapped out, Brown’s gritty drama seems poised to rewrite the script.

      " Two fashion executives give their two cents. Two fashion executives give their two cents. Styling: Gio Chiappetta Let’s face it, luxury watches are the least coveted accessory by men of a younger age. We don’t know much about them. They're something our fathers wore. When it comes to telling time, we've ditched analog, relying heavily on our phones and smart watches. Most of us can’t even afford a good watch if we wanted to. Good watches are historically unaffordable to the average man (the classic ‘starter’ Rolex starting at $5,000). So, as a non-purveyor of fine watches (I wear a Garmin Forerunner 350) I was recently caught off guard when I came across a beautiful $1,800 watch from Oris called the BC3 Advanced, that I fell in love with. I dug deeper and found a whole catalog of watches that I had never seen any of my friends wearing (or anyone else for that matter). There was a tasteful air to the watch, an elegant impression, one unexecuted by the popular, more accessible watches wrapped around the wrists of the masses. It got me thinking. What does make for a good starter watch? Is it the shape, size, color, band type? Do men even care about Swiss movement? I wanted to know so I reached out to two business professionals who I thought might have different opinions and asked. Marti Crampshee, VP of Marketing, Versace, wears the Blue Oris Aquis Date (39.5mm) Do you wear a watch? If so, what brand of watch do you wear? Rolex GMT II and IWC Portofino. How do you know about watches?  An admiration of them since childhood, which could end up turning into an addiction. What makes a good starter watch? I think something plain, simple and understated. If you had $2,000 to spend on a watch of any style, what style would you buy? Search high and low for a vintage Rolex. What characteristics does an accessory need for every day wear? Durability, style and flexibility (for outfits). What color for everyday wear? Silver or black Quality or name? Quality Fashion or function? Fashion Heritage or hype? Heritage Left hand or right hand? Left Justin Stewart, CEO, Cherry Pick wears Grey/Orange Oris Chronoris Date (39mm) Do you wear a watch? If so, what brand of watch do you wear? I don’t wear a watch, I’ve never worn a watch. I got an apple watch for Christmas three years ago I wore it for a month. I tried to get used to it and failed. How do you know about watches?  I really don’t. Watches as something cool has never been me. Outright symbols of status has always been something unattractive to me. What makes a good starter watch? Something that is of a higher quality that feels good, that I can notice a meaningful difference. It’s like the difference between good steak and bad steak. If you had $2,000 to spend on a watch of any style, what style would you buy? A plane ticket to Paris. What characteristics does an accessory need for every day wear? I think it needs to have the ability to become part of your body. It cannot be something that is too much of a call out. What color for everyday wear? Silver Quality or name? Quality Fashion or function? Quality Heritage or hype? Quality Left hand or right hand? Right \n",

      "Alexander Roth doesn't consider himself a photographer. The NYC-based creative is best known for his candid polaroids of New York Fashion Week (in the style of Gigi Hadid's own @gisposable), he considers himself merely a vehicle of the moment. Roth is an active member of the New York City art scene, interspersing his various collaborations with a steady modeling career. His Instagram, @alexanderdroth, has gained nearly 40,000 followers, and Roth supplements the feed with his own original photography, life updates, and artwork. Most recently, Roth partnered with the iconic fashion house Dior on a new editorial (shot by Nick DeLito, styled by Roth, and makeup by Erin Esparza). VMAN asked the rising star about his beginnings in New York, his creative inspirations, and what kind of art he wants to see in the world.  \n",
      "You’re based in NYC. Are you from here? What brought you to the city? \n",
      "I grew up on Long Island and then went to college in Maryland. I came right to the city afterwards. Growing up so close to the city, I knew I wanted to end up here, one way or another. \n",
      "What's your favorite part of working in New York? \n",
      "Everyone’s focus is not just in one bucket; it’s common for people to dip their hands in multiple waters, which is the new norm. Also, New York City might be big but it’s also very small — everyone knows each other through some degree of separation. \n",
      "Describe an ideal day for you, whether you’re working or on vacation.  \n",
      "Wake up around 9am, egg sandwich made by Dawn from the deli on my block for breakfast. Get ready and head to wherever we’re shooting or working for the day. The whole crew is made up of friends or people whose work I admire. That’s when I feel we create the best product. For lunch, a Katsu Sando from Lost In The Sauce. Then back to set, finish work, hopefully play with someones dog somewhere in there, most likely Pepe Rosso carbonara pasta for dinner. Definitely end with a Marvel movie. \n",
      "What are some essentials you never leave home without? \n",
      "This sounds corny, but I try not to leave the house without being in a positive headspace; it shapes how you go into your day. You’re only as good as the energy you keep. Then, of course, phone, wallet, chapstick and keys.  \n",
      "Who are some artists you look up to? \n",
      "The word “artist” is evident in any creative industry, so I have a bunch. Helmut Newton, Jonathan Anderson, Jack Vettriano, Rei Kawakubo, John Galliano, to name a few. And a lot of members of the young New York scene, everyone is shaping their craft. It’s inspiring to watch. \n",
      "Earlier this year, you released some iconic NYFW disposables showing a lighter side of fashion week. What prompted you to go for a more informal tone with that project? \n",
      "I think personality really shines through a photo more than anything. We see so many candid moments in magazines, social, web, etc., and generally I think we’re more attracted to spontaneity. We look for people’s true selves to shine through photos, raw emotion at that exact moment, you know? I just wanted to show exactly what I saw, but more importantly, I wanted to show a more personal and brighter side to an event [Fashion Week]. As of late, it’s had a negative connotation associated with it. Having the photos taken with @manual_nyc disposables gives it a novelty that digital or iPhone photos just don’t have. There’s a nostalgic quality to it, more than anything; you look at a photo and you’re like, “Yeah, I wanna keep that shit.” \n",
      "In what ways do you attempt to capture the personality of your subjects when you’re shooting? \n",
      "I don’t really consider myself a photographer. That would require me to me well-versed in the technicalities of it all. I like to capture moments with what I’m given. Plain and simple. \n",
      "What elements of Dior did you want to capture with the latest editorial? \n",
      "I wanted to keep the looks simple to show the elegance of each piece. Dior’s DNA is with tailoring and couture, Kim is a master of both and blends them seamlessly. His love for collaborating with artists and friends is evident and inspiring. Collaborating with people I admire is always my plan when it comes to projects like these. Nick’s photography is unmatched and Erin is Picasso with with a makeup brush, they're so easy to work with. Also, I love playing with the things that bring me the feeling of nostalgia. Each shoot location are places from my childhood where I would spend a lot of time and have some of my best memories with my family. \n",
      "How does the creative process differ when you’re working alone vs. collaborating with a major brand? \n",
      "It’s pretty much the same, honestly. I want to keep the integrity of the brand visible in the final product, but with my own touch. I’ve definitely developed a process by now. I’m always second guessing myself and asking everyone for their opinion even if they’re not well-informed on the topic. I like to understand as many view points as I can to see how something might be perceived. \n",
      "What kind of photography do you wish you saw more of in the world? \n",
      "I think we're exposed to it all with social media. We’re at the point where the bigger names are using the more uncommon or younger artists. I think its great but there is a fine line between using someone because you believe they’re a good fit and using someone for views.      \n",

What direction do you want to go in as an artist?   SJ I’m here. It’s looking like north, right?   How would you describe the energy at your shows?   SJ Passion. It’s an excessive amount of passion. It’s like me being able to redo the songs for the first time over, but you’re watching.   What's the strangest/most exciting fan encounter you’ve had?   SJ (Laughs) I get things all the time, but the craziest thing, someone flew from Tokyo to DC to see me two nights ago.   How does it feel to leave that kind of impression on someone?   SJ I just felt a responsibility. I just want to make sure I’m responsible.   What’s next on your to-do list?   SJ I want a Grammy. I think I deserve one of those.

      " Today, Gucci released a new book dedicated to Harlem's Dapper Dan with a signing during Pitti Uomo in Florence. Today, Gucci released a new book dedicated to Harlem's Dapper Dan with a signing during Pitti Uomo in Florence. Text: Reshmi Kaur Oberoi Today, Gucci announced the release of a limited edition homage to Dapper Dan - Daniel Day.  With a $200-price-tag, there will be 500 copies available in the Gucci Wooster Bookstore, the November 2018 addition to the atelier’s SoHo retail space that opened only 6 months prior, and Gucci Garden in Florence, where a book signing will coincide with Pitti Uomo on January 8. With a $200-price-tag and a limited stock of 5oo copies available in the bookstore, one could consider these collectibles. The SoHo-based literati tapped photographer Ari Marcapoulos to document his half-hour subway ride uptown to the heart of Harlem, the crib of Dapper Dan, where the designer beloved by the everyday citizen and hustler crowd was not only born but also forged his eponymous creations. Marcopoulos is already familiar with Dan x Gucci having shot their pre-Fall 2018 capsule collection look-book. Dapper Dan told GQ that his designs catered to the hustler style, at odds with the preppy Ivy League look that debuted during the 80s-his initial foray into design. Day professes to designing with the time and changing style preferences, rather than creating defined lines. Evidence of this true-to-style aesthetic is the 2017 collaboration with Gucci that Transpired via here-say among the pop cultural influencers in Day’s social circle. The eventual retrospective capsule partnership utilized vintage Gucci prints and Day’s archival creations like acid-washed heavy weight denim, tracksuits with python piping, and uncanny Christmas palette of colors that harkens Gucci imagery like red, black, green, and gold. Recollection of past handiwork required some hunting down by Day’s son and business manager, Jelani Day, in the aftermath of his apartment being raided. The book features portraits of Day’s friends- movers and shakers in their own right that include Harlem-based chef Marcus Samuelsson, author Cleo Wade, and artist Trevor Andrews. V Magazine reached out to Wooster Bookstore to one of the book worms – staff – confirmed that the books had not yet arrived with a couple of calls already being made for its purchase. \n",

      " Where did the menswear accessory causing red carpet controversy really come from? Where did the menswear accessory causing red carpet controversy really come from? Text: Reshmi Kaur Oberoi The late 19th C fanny pack’s less-endowed sibling- the harness- is the latest accessory to no longer become a gender-specific relic. It has been crafted in such a way so as to bypass its controversial history: From country western stereotypes and combat gear sported by armed civil officers, to being of stripped of its weapon-holster capabilities, to being utilized as a fashionable accessory that emphasizes the female silhouette, to becoming a faux-shirt for openly gay men. The suspender-like garment has been revived in high fashion, and most notably by red carpet heavyweights. The result? A slew of celebrities, almost all men, have sported the controversial garment without batting an eye. Yet this lightweight accessory has stirred up some weighty matters. Timothée Chalamet donned a Louis Vuitton black harness at the year’s first red carpet. Wearing the quintessential dressy uniform- all black. His pastor-collar long-sleeved button down paired with black trousers was accented by a black sequined harness from Virgil Abloh’s S/S ‘19 collection. The 23-year-old actor was quick to address the newest inanimate addition to Twitter on the Ellen Show, possibly crying wolf when he said, “I thought it was a bib! They told me it was a bib!” He did not want to be associated with sex culture. GQ combatted the popular idea that the garment was a kind of sex toy, reporting that the harness was “nothing like the BDSM gear you would think of when someone says, well, a harness. This is the bejeweled kind we are talking about. And the high-fashion item is officially called an embroidered bib.” Ineffectual as a bib, considering the purpose is to shield one’s clothing underneath, makes it unlikely as such. That said, what GQ reported is not synonymous to Chalamet’s horror at being linked to the controversial clothing made popular by queer culture in 1960s San Francisco. In an op-Ed, a gay writer argues that it took a straight man of celebrity status to normalize the “on the fringes” garment. In contrast, Esquire’s senior culture editor tweeted that the rhinestone-studded harness was the equivalent to a school-goer’s Jan-sport backpack. Michael B. Jordan donned another Abloh harness to the SAG Awards. Multicolored in a galactic motif, the Abloh creation didn’t cause quite the same stir as its predecessor. Still, it was enough to catapult the harness as a guarantee for landing on best-dressed lists. Predating both straight celebrities was the openly gay Olympian, Adam Rippon who sported a harness in the classic BDSM black leather to the Academy Awards in March 4, 2018. The Moschino chest harness’s impact was evident: Cher mentioned it as an example of Rippon's self-confidence in the excerpt published for TIME Magazine’s 100 Most Influential. In the days that followed, Rippon tweeted, “I think fashion is all about self expression and I chose to wear what I wore on the red carpet because I felt cool AF. Everyone should take risks, be bold. It’s LOTS of fun.” Jordan quipped that he wasn’t concerned with any deeper existentialist matters, but just thought, “why not? It was just like f-ck it, I’m going to do it.” Alexander McQueen crafted lambskin harnesses for women wear Resort 19. The accessories did not conjure homosexuality and instead were likened to being a strong woman: a warrior-princess. The cut-out in, what would otherwise be considered a bib or a vest, was meant to frame a woman’s curves much like a bustier accentuates the bosom like a bra cup would. McQueen’s harness was a hard-hitting western take on its softer effeminate counterpart, the corset. Creative Director, Sarah Burton’s impetus for the design was rooted in British Paganism. The harness was a form of strict tailoring emphasizing strength as opposed to softness- a woman who is “rooted to the ground, rooted to the earth,” Burton explained. Harnesses are paralleled to sex in more than one way. For example, for many religions, sexual acts are not for purposes of pleasure, but are instead a means to an end: to reproduce, to continue the human race or a belief system. It’s a numbers game. Likewise, harnesses for civic-armed officers, professional photographers, rock climbers to prevent falls, to hold infants, all serve a specific purpose. Though Abloh’s design was inspired by Michael Jackson’s glittery golden harness at halftime during the Superbowl, one could argue that wearing the garment was to serve the performance and the audience. And while one could argue that bondage is a purpose, or simply a means of expressing one’s self, the underlying reasons for wearing anything rests on how one wants to present his/herself. And that is wear the waters get murky: what is the place of pop cultural icons in a larger societal context? How far is too far? The red carpet harness has struck a chord, just as Michael Jackson intended, but this time, it is not without a power struggle. \n",

Text: Czar Van Gaal Ermenegildo Zegna's just-opened flagship, replacing its former 5th Ave. digs, befits the Italian house's near-110 year history of fine craftsmanship. Outfitted with an entirely new façade of metallic strings signifying a finely woven textile, the seven-thousand-square-foot, Peter Marino-designed menswear mecca has been in the works since 2016. At long last, the Milan-based brand's latest \"Global Store\" has arrived, transforming the historic (and high-priced) Crown Building into its very own museum. The store pays homage to Zegna’s past with historical images, a luxurious atelier for suiting personalization and a vintage Italian bar, but the interior contents also look to the future. To accompany the new store, Ermenegildo Zegna will debut the Taccuino capsule, a leisurewear collection geared toward a younger, athleisure-seeking clientele. The capsule was inspired by a young Ermenegildo Zegna, taking visual cues from a notebook that the brand's founder used on one of his first trips to New York in 1938. Known for utilizing top of the line fabrics and complementing designs with impeccable tailoring, Zegna’s new temple is sure to conjure a multi-generational outlook on luxury. \n",

Collaborating in support of Pharrell's campaign for female empowerment \"Now Is Her Time\", this duo is so important. Text: Dylan Kelly Adidas Originals has secured several celebrity endorsements as part of their marketing  campaigns over the years, but their latest collaboration is much more than a simple photo shoot. Partnering with Pharrell Williams on his campaign “Now Is Her Time”, a political movement that supports female empowerment through representation and bold voices, Adidas is cementing their political standpoint as a brand, advocating for gender equality, releasing exclusive apparel alongside Pharrell, and controlling the zeitgeist as they go.  Pharrell’s latest collaboration with Adidas Originals features women of various identities and backgrounds sharing the stories of their personal endeavors through womanhood as well as the allies who support the “Now Is Her Time” movement. Utilizing Pharrell’s platform to amplify the voices of these women, the “Now Is Her Time” campaign, shot by legendary photographer Collier Schorr, is blasting international soundwaves of awareness on issues and perspectives regarding gender, sexuality, and race.  Among the many featured in the campaign are co-founder of Black Lives Matter Patrisse Cullors, founder of period.org Nadya Okamoto, singer-songwriter Syd, director Reggie Yates, architectural technologist Iddris Sandu, surfer Keala Naihe, human rights activist Sana Azim, founder of Art Mom Project Tyra Mitchell, co-founder of Style Saves Isabel Rangel Grutman, models Sara Cummings and Kadija Diawara, and dancers Sheena Cain and Sophia Parker.  Pharrell’s own Billionaire Boys Club has collaborated with Adidas Originals in support of the “Now Is Her Time” efforts to create two unisex shoes that will support the campaign. Known as the “Now Is Her Time” pack, the two silhouettes are available at Billionaire Boys Club in two exclusive colors: a vibrant red and a fluorescent yellow. Athleisure at it’s finest, these exclusive kicks add an eccentric pop of color and a vibrant aesthetic to any outfit, all the while remaining comfortable in style.  In an Instagram post promoting the campaign, Pharrel wrote, “History was her time. Now is her time. The future is her time,” and the buzz surrounding his efforts has been astoundingly supportive. The “Now Is Her Time” pack will be available in Billionaire Boys Club NYC, London, and Tokyo Flagships as well as the website on August 31. Show your support with these politically-aware sneakers because now is certainly her time.  \n",

Models stood stoically still, as if sculptures on pedestals, before they disappeared into the darkness of an infinite runway. It was almost as if Jones translated the theatrical nature of the classic runway format into performance art. The context immediately shifted, and for good reason. This season, Jones collaborated with artist Raymond Pettibon, widely known for his pen- like drawings and album artwork for bands like Black Flag and Sonic Youth. As models rolled by, all eyes were fixed on the garments. “The inspiration [for the collection] comes from the artworks of Raymond, from the more romantic part of his work and tying that into the loves of Monsieur Dior, which was the nature and the romance of the House,” explains Jones. The collection includes items emblazoned with works handpicked by the designer, as well as original prints. “It was a very easy process,” Jones elates. Having discovered Pettibon’s work as a teenager, he says, “It has been a dream to work with him.” Ahead of the artist’s Fall show at the newly opened David Zwirner Paris gallery, Raymond Pettibon recalls the creative exchange. VMAN Let’s start from the top. How did this collaboration with Kim Jones come about? I understand you were also working on a series of leopard drawings and prints for Dior Men? RAYMOND PETTIBON I believe it was Stella Schnabel who set it up through David Zwirner Gallery. The leopard drawings were suggested by Kim Jones. I was happy for the chance to work with them. I’ve never felt that my work has to be confined to the white cube of the museum or gallery world. VMAN Tell us about the specific works used in the collection. I understand some of these have never been exhibited before. RP Some go back a while, some were not done specifically for the project. Ultimately, it came down to Kim Jones’s choice and sensibility. VMAN What was the dialogue like with Kim? What was this exchange? How would you categorize the works that Kim selected? RP My works were like any of my pieces that would appear in one of my books or shows. That is, they were not designs or illustrations. It was Kim Jones’s inspiration to make fashion out of them. VMAN What was it like seeing your works reinterpreted in embroideries? Once applied to clothing, do you feel like the messaging of the works shifts at all? RP I don’t mind seeing my work displayed [in contexts] other than gallery walls; that can be tattoos or fashion, walls, street art or telephone poles. In fact, I rather like to see it in unexpected places. VMAN Tell me a bit about your process. How do you select phrases and words to match imagery? RP It’s an adjunctive, associative process I’ve developed over many, many years. It comes out of literature, of writing, reading, rewriting, editing and wedding [those influences] to imagery. Images can come from any source whether imagined, abstracted, borrowed, found; from nature or real life. VMAN I’m also curious to know more about your beginning in the punk rock scene. Tell me a bit about this time. RP I never did drawings for punk; my brother happened to be in a punk band and had a punk record label. Since I made art and he didn’t have a massive in-house art department to work with, he asked me to do some of his covers and flyers. VMAN What do you feel your experience in the punk music scene brings to your works? RP Nothing. VMAN What do you hope the viewer takes away from your works? Are you hoping for a particular reaction? RP That’s undecided. Once a work leaves my hands I don’t have any expectations. I’ve never thought of it—there is no hectoring on my part for the proper way of reading or seeing my work.     “The inspiration for [the collection] comes from the artworks of Raymond, from the more romantic part of his work and tying that into the loves of Monsieur Dior, which was the nature and the romance of the house. It was a very easy process. It has been a dream to work with him.” — Kim Jones.   \n",

And now, it seems, the stress of constant jet-setting and staying on top of his overbooked social calendar has taken its toll on Abloh’s health: the designer announced that he has decided to take a three-month break from traveling and work home instead, as ordered by his doctor. And yes, this means staying in Chicago AKA missing the Off-White women’s show in Paris scheduled for September 26th.  Regardless, Abloh sees this as a positive thing: a way to re-charge, rehabilitate and breathe new life into his creative process. “I’m excited to drop the kids off at school and be able to be here for those moments,” he told Vogue.com. “I’m using this as I do everything else, as a way to propel me forward.” Wishing you the best, V.A.! \n",

      "If Coco Chanel designed the Little Black Dress, then Yohji Yamamoto designed everything else in the closet. Paving a path of his own by bringing everyday ease to the avant-garde, Yohji Yamamoto has developed quite the reputation for odd proportions, dramatically abstract silhouettes, and color palettes dark enough to put any New Yorker’s wardrobe to shame. Making a departure from his black monochromatic looks, Yohji Yamamoto uses SS20 to introduce graphic print into his design repertoire.   \n",
      "Showing at Paris Men’s Fashion Week; Yohji Yamamoto’s SS20 collection features free-flowing wide leg trousers, extended long-line button downs, and oversized coats showcasing Yamamoto’s unwavering quest for impeccable tailoring. And as one wouldn’t expect a tiger to change their stripes, a Yohji Yamamoto collection wouldn’t be just that without hints of black. Strategically using his preferred shade of black as a canvas, Yamamoto features white, yellow, red, and blue photograph prints as accents to deliver an unexpected pop of color. The prominence of color in the collection gradually builds up look after look until a grand reveal of blue and yellow trench coats brighten up the runway.  \n",

      "Celine, with Hedi Slimane at its helm, was consistent with its SS19 show at Paris Fashion Week. There were many pieces that seemed in congruence with this new era of Celine, but if you looked closely, you would notice there was something very new for everyone involved. The label partnered with artist Chrisian Marclay to create sneakers, jackets, backpacks and various leather goods. Many of these pieces were featured on the models walking down the runway, but now you can wear them too. \n",
      "The collaboration is expansive: bomber, denim and leather jackets, military parkas, crew neck Ts, lace-up and slip-on sneakers and a leather wallet run the gamut of the line. These items utilize an onomatopoeic motif throughout. Marclay discussed this artistic choice in detail, “What I love about onomatopoeias is that they’re not really words, they’re images… The idea of having these sounds on people’s bodies is also a beautiful image. They come to life, they’re like sound effects for everyday movements… It’s beautiful how, through the translation, the graphics get altered, become something different.” Slimane and Marclay have now created pieces that visually manifest action and drama for day-to-day wear. \n",

Photography duo Mert and Marcus look to their formative years in the ’90s for a limited-edition capsule collection with DSQUARED2. Photography: Mert Alas & Marcus Piggot Styling: Semra Russell Text: MATHIAS ROSENZWEIG         This feature appears in the pages of VMAN41, our Spring 2019 issue, on newsstands March 1st! Pre-order the issue here.  The saying “A jack of all trades is a master of none,” despite its ubiquity, doesn’t quite hold up in the creative sphere. History supports that with the right amount of good taste and determina- tion, talent is transferable. Case in point: Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott, who, since pioneering digital manipulation in the ’90s, have created some of the industry’s most beloved fashion photography: Kate Moss drawing her foot to her mouth to puff a cigarette cradled between her toes, or a ghostly Björk wading through a ooded house. Now, the pair is conquering fashion design, having released a capsule col- lection with Italian powerhouse DSQUARED2 called 1994. “It was the year we met,” Mert says of the col- lection’s name. It was also when DSQUARED2 founders Dean and Dan Caten began planning the launch of their brand, which re ected the fun-loving energy of the time. “At the same time, Mert adds, “it was the year of a lot of dressing up, a lot of partying, a lot of music, change of hair col- ors, and trying to express ourselves as differently as we could from everybody else,” Mert adds.     The ’90s-inspired designs—metallic silver pants and pink mesh tops reminiscent of tech- no’s heyday and sweatpants begging to be worn high-waisted and with a fanny pack—are ampli- ed by graphics drawn from early Mert & Marcus highlights. But 23 years later, the duo’s work is still controversial. During the 1994 preview in Milan last September, some sneered at a hoodie featuring two women kissing. “There is a certain punk in me and Marcus,” Mert admits. But don’t call the collection “nostalgic.” “Fashion is, in one way or another, a repeat of memories, stories, history, and so on,” Mert says. “Sometimes we salute those moments and sometimes we wish we never had them.” Nor is the collection tied to a region, despite possible comparisons to the acid-house streetwear aesthetic emerging—or reemerg- ing—in places like Russia and Berlin. “Quite frankly, the [fashion] we are seeing in Russia and Berlin and so on are not too far off from what we were wearing in the ’90s,” says Mert. “They could be the same clothes, maybe with a different waistline or [paired with a different] accessory. Instead of branding the DNA of the collection with the ’90s, or Berlin or Russia, what we were trying to create is streetwear that has our point of view, what we like, and what we want people to wear.”     And who better to re-envision ’90s nostal- gia than Mert & Marcus? After all, for finding a fresh POV, two pairs of eyes are better than one.         \n",

      " Ryan Trecartin, Lizzie Fitch, and Fondazione Prada break new ground in the hinterlands of Athens, Ohio. Ryan Trecartin, Lizzie Fitch, and Fondazione Prada break new ground in the hinterlands of Athens, Ohio. Photography: Rhett Larue Text: Samuel Anderson \n",
      "Ryan Trecartin and Lizzie Fitch slip-n-slid their way to art world acclaim in the 2010s, powered by dueling, highly visual forces: one the RISD grads’ wabi-sabi video art techniques, the other their subsequent cult stardom. If celebrities were adjacent to Fitch/Trecartin-land, they would eventually be absorbed by it; a 2016 commission saw Kendall Jenner and Gigi Hadid as Snapchat-inspired tableaux vivants, transposed with cutesy yet deranged animal masks. But the latest Fitch/Trecartin showcase disrupts this delicate equation. Having long explored the bounds between the real and imagined, Fitch and Trecartin recently severed their close connection to the postmodern milieu, decamping from L.A. to a 32-acre live-work studio in Athens, Ohio. \n",
      "Both Ohio natives, Fitch and Trecartin often create hermetic spaces to channel their fluid, Internet-bred visions. (As one of their final pre-move projects, they overtook an entire Masonic temple.) The studio, cosigned by Fondazione Prada, the luxury brand’s eponymous Milan art space, is a carte blanche for those visions to flourish. “For so many years we built things that were temporary,” says Trecartin. “By moving here, we wanted to create something that had a [long] life. The Foundation was very encouraging of [that].” As reflected in their inaugural exhibit, “Whether Line,” made of works created onsite in Athens, the campus offers ample space for the artists’ dystopian whims. In said works, artist pals roam the woods, filing under a transplanted TSA-grade metal detector or scaling watchtower-like structures. “We tried to use forms that have recreational use in some contexts or can be oppressive or jail-like; maybe [the metal detector] is for theme park guests, or maybe it’s for surveillance,” Trecartin explains. \n",
      "But as the duo discovered, putting theory into practice is more complicated on a construction site. “We faced a lot of building challenges that we did not anticipate,” says Fitch. “Much of the land here is on top of clay,” adds Trecartin. “It slips really easily when you disturb it, so there was a lot of engineering to figure out, which we had never dealt with before.” \n",
      "The property’s crowning jewel is its Trecartin-designed mega-pool. “We [flew in] someone from Las Vegas who does those weird fancy pools at hotels, and we also employed workers from the Athens area for the actual construction,” says Trecartin. A monument to resort-style grandeur and post-ironic whimsy, the pool is an emblem of Trecartin and Fitch’s long term ambitions. Busy shooting footage for an exhibition in Milan slated for this fall, they have work to do yet before declaring the property Miuccia-ready (the Prada co-chief executive and lead creative director has yet to visit, but she plans to, say Trecartin and Fitch). “Our goal is to slowly continue to add to this property and almost develop it out as a kind of amusement park,” says Trecartin. “The first phase is about 80% complete,” adds Fitch. “We would like to build it out a lot more and expand its form, but [we need] to first get it to a functional point.” \n",
      "Unlike lazy rivers and treehouses, Internet access has been a surprisingly low priority in the Fitch/Trecartin infrastructure plan. “We didn’t have [Internet] for the first year that we lived here,” says Trecartin, perhaps the foremost artist of his WiFi-dependent generation. “It was really weird at first, but I kind of loved it. Now it’s like I can’t even bring myself to use Instagram anymore. It was just so much fun not using it.” Without the shackles of social media, these art pioneers are finally free to choose their own adventure.   \n",

      "Virgil Abloh, Louis Vuitton’s Menswear Artistic Director presented his Autumn / Winter 2019 collection at the Jardin des Tuileries on Thursday in Paris. The show was an homage to Pop Megastar Michael Jackson. The inspiration was clear, Abloh sent white gloves in lieu of the traditional paper invites. As the crowds entered Michael Jackson’s music filled the space against the backdrop of a set, which was a city landscape reminiscent of 1980’s New York (traffic lights, trash cans, roads signs, fire hydrants, and a barber shop). \n",
      "Live music took over from Jackson’s hits as Dev Hynes (Blood Orange) created an original composition for the runway. Abloh's love of music was obvious in this show, he is also a DJ and producer. Abloh is known for merging fashion and music together, in fact Dev Hynes has even walked at Abloh’s colorful debut Louis Vuitton show back last year. \n",
      "In front row attendance was Naomi Campbell who got the 80’s memo, Naomi wowed in a tonal look. The show began with an army of grey looks, it featured a plenty of coats, jackets (quilted and puffer) relaxed tailoring paired with sneakers. Abloh also took on the classic items such as the trench which was shown in various colors. The show moved onto colors of silver, lilac and lavender before returning to tonal looks of all black. \n",
      "There was a huge focus on oversized backpacks and holdalls. Abloh reimagined the classic Louis Vuitton staple for today’s hype driven consumer, he presented bags of blue, purple, pink and fluorescent green. The looks progressed into natural tones and then browns before the show cumulated in a celebration of color, unity and identity. Abloh sent models down the runway draped in flags of various countries (an ode to MJ’s, We Are the World). Paving stones from the runway also light up (a reference to Jackson's Billie Jean music video) as did the models sneakers and backpacks. \n",
      "Abloh's has only just started at Louis Vuitton’s Menswear top position and he has already proven to be a huge commercial and artistic success.   \n",

      "Calling the Y/Project Spring Summer 2020 collection “unconventional” might just be the biggest understatement of the year. In fact, it’s fair to say that just about every look that went down the runway at Paris Fashion Week broke at least one of the rules of garment making, from tailoring and construction to proportion and presentation. \n",
      "Rule breaking may look easy, but the amount of work put into this intentional irreverence is apparent. Serious drapery and tailoring know-how lie at the heart of this collection. \n",
      "Despite, or better yet, because of this disregard for fashion law, Y/Project created something equally jarring and intriguing. Creative director Glenn Martens may have strayed from convention, but he certainly stayed true to Y/Project’s eccentric character. \n",
      "Though most ensembles were oversized, the variations were far and wide. Marten’s love affair with denim was on full display, this time either as wide leg, zippered cargos or dad jeans with, let’s call them, “shoe umbrellas” that bring to mind the tiny rain jackets seen on city-dwelling pups when it’s raining outside. Still, other denim pieces featured bright, artisanal hand painting. \n",
      "Chunky cable knit sweaters were further “chunkified” by pulling at the seams to create a cinched, asymmetrical cut, baring t-shirts and skin underneath. Quarter zips and utility jackets featured exaggerated, popped collars and twisted tailoring, leaving a disheveled temperament in its wake. A dress shirt designed to pull at all the wrong places conjured up images of a drunken bar fight, while semi iridescent suits with faint patterns left a more sophisticated impression. \n",
      "Fashion rules aside, Y/Project confronted our comfort zone head on. The delivery, as chaotic as it may have seemed, was masterful. \n",

Text: Brandon Tan With the mark of the new year is also a rush of new collections. Just around the corner are the Men's Fashion Weeks spanning London, Paris, Milan and New York. Though proving exhausting to keep up with, the month-long review of runways this season are also anticipating of much excitement. With the tremendous development of menswear as its own pillar within the industry, designers across the globe are stepping up their fashions for the fellas. Below, we round up the most exciting highlights of the menswear mania to ensue! CELINE by Hedi Slimane Arguably the most looked forward to show of the season is CELINE's first menswear show by newly-appointed creative director, Hedi Slimane. The show marks Slimane's second collection at CELINE, but the house's first of full menswear. The creative director's removal of an accent aigu from the brand's logo proved a minor move with major impact, causing a stir among fans of the French house's previous director, Phoebe Philo. Full forced Slimane followed, introducing menswear to the line for the first time, in their Spring Summer 2019 show, and then announcing a full menswear show for Fall Winter 2019. In excitement our knees buckle and our boots shake for this show that is sure to be iconic. The show will be held January 20th. Louis Vuitton Louis Vuitton men's FW19 show will be Virgil Abloh's second collection as the maison's creative director of the menswear division. The designer's appointment made waves across media as the first person of color to be heading such a prestigious French label. Abloh sustained all of the chatter after a buzz-worthy show that represented a new chapter for both himself and Vuitton, sending visions of white down the runway on a full cast of black models. Apparently, this collection is inspired by Michael Jackson to whom Abloh quotes as a direct inspiration in an interview with Interview Magazine. \"When I have Michael singing in the background, it’s a different type of shirt, it’s a different kind of boot, it’s a different fit of pants.

The show will be held January 7th. Fumito Ganryu Fumito Ganryu is an emerging Japanese designer who launched his own eponymous label after sharpening his talents at a stint with Comme Des Garçons. After showing at Pitti Uomo for his first collection, Ganryu will be debuting his second in Paris. While the context changes, his integrity to redefining high quality from pricey materials to those unknown and untapped remains. Another concept central to the design of his garments is interchangeability, in form and in function, seeking an aesthetic that he deems as \"genderless\" over \"gender-bending\". The show will be held January 15th Jacquemus's Second Menswear Collection Simon Porte Jacquemus of his own label, Jacquemus, is well-known for his womenswear that somehow shares an aesthetic between avant-garde and effortless. That said, after much teasing last year, he debuted his first menswear collection. Drawing inspiration from his local South of France, his designs leaned more towards the easy, breezy side of things, showing  a march of baggy pants and linen shirts. For FW19, the designer has adopted a more hush-hush approach to his typical Instagram teasing, with not many hints of what to expect for his second menswear collection. The show will be held January 20th. \n",

Known for celebrating Americana Lauren has created a multi-billion dollar company that is recognized across the globe. The film also shows a personal side of Ralph as he talks about his love for classic movies, vintage cars, and baseball. Speaking on the documentary Lauren said “I actually didn’t want to do it, but everybody was pushing me to do it. I didn’t want the publicity. But this is a momentous time. It was the 50th anniversary, and it all came together as something special. The film was directed and produced by Susan Lacy, an Emmy nominee who directed Jane Fonda in Five Acts and Spielberg for HBO. Lacy conducted several in-depth interviews with Lauren to get a full understanding of what drives this 80-year-old man to keep going, to keep designing. “He’s a very shy man. He’s not a guy who opens up easily. He’s very private and he’s shy and we got to know each other pretty well, and he ended up with a lot of trust in me,” said Lacy. Check out the trailer for the documentary, Very Ralph below. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dv2QL9z1HPU Very Ralph, debuts Tuesday November. 12 exclusively on HBO.

      " Rick Owens is returning to LA for the first time in forever with a VIP book launch Rick Owens is returning to LA for the first time in forever with a VIP book launch Text: Paul Madley Not content with disrupting the fashion status quo, Rick Owens is now an author and curator. The designer has released two new books, one in collaboration with photographer and friend Danielle Levitt, and the other in homage to his creative hero, Lary Legaspi. Owens will return to LA for an invite-only book signing on November 18. The first book, RICK OWENS PHOTOGRAPHED BY DANIELLE LEVITT features 150 images of the designer's work. The photographs include exclusive behind the scenes moments as well as magic from the runways. Owens collaborated with Danielle Levitt who spent a decade capturing the images. “Danielle’s imagery has a clear-eyed honesty and tenderness that I want to align myself with and endorse. The way she has captured what I do is exactly how I want it to be remembered,” said Owens. Levitt commented, “The images that I make, I believe, are of the moment where what Rick thinks, feels, and wants to present is actually seen. This is Rick’s entire vision as documented by me. It actually gets me emotional,” she says, “because he gets better every season. How does he do that? I’m an artist, he’s an artist, but his artistry—every time I see it, it’s better. I’m in awe of his level of artistry and focus.” The second book, “LEGASPI” chronicles the life and creations of the late designer Larry Legaspi. Curated by Owens the book is a tribute to his idol. Huge in the 1970’s Legaspi a New York designer was responsible for some of the most iconic imagery of that era. Legaspi worked with Kiss and Grace Jones, both major inspirations to Owens. Legaspi died of AIDS in 2001 and overtime his legacy has somewhat been forgotten. Owens's new book pays tribute to the designer with contributions from Pat Cleveland and André Leon Talley. The exclusive book signing will take place at Rick Owens LA boutique on November 18. RICK OWENS PHOTOGRAPHED BY DANIELLE LEVITT and LEGASPI are published by Rizzoli Books. \n",

For his latest venture, though, he's taken a much more analogue approach. If you want any of the pieces from his newest brand, named Fall Risk, be prepared to pick up the phone and call him (on a landline, no less, Vogue reports). His new label has a trendy, tongue in cheek approach with a heavy focus on youth culture and vintage aesthetics.    The line is set to include athleticwear, blouses, bras, camisoles, caps, coats, denim jackets and jeans, dresses, footwear, loungewear, sweaters. It's sold to customers through an exclusive drop (if you're a member, that is) or with a call to the design team. With the likes of Bella Hadid already having been seen in Fall Risk, it's well worth picking up the phone.  \n",

Text: Dylan Kelly Bridging athletics with fashion, Los Angeles-based streetwear brand 424 announced a one-of-a-kind partnership with the forward-thinking sports association Arsenal Football Club. As the team’s official formal wear partner, 424 will keep the world-class club in pristine condition with custom suits for head coach Unai Emery, the first-team players, the senior club staff, and for the first time, Arsenal Woman. Inspired by the urgency of social and political issues, Guatemalan designer Guillermo Andrade founded 424 in 2015 to combine his passion for fashion design with his efforts to make bold statements and spread provocative messages. As a leader in progressive fashion, Andrade takes a creative approach to his stance on relevant topics with an authentic design aesthetic that resonates with his growing fanbase. Seeking to push the boundaries on fashion, Andrade is bringing the 424 signature red armband to the sleeves of professional athletes and spreading his message to an entirely new audience of athletically-inclined individuals.  “We are excited to welcome 424 as the Official Formal Wear Partner of Arsenal men’s team and, for the very first time, Arsenal Women,” Arsenal Commercial Director Peter Silverstone stated. “Their creative and innovative values match those of Arsenal Football Club and we look forward to collaborating with 424 to create exciting content and events to showcase their latest designs, whilst helping them reach a new audience and grow their brand internationally.” Born out of Andrade’s friendship with Arsenal football player Hector Bellerin, this two-year collaboration speaks volumes to the club’s organizational values.

Young Hollywood's edgiest power couple attended the Milan Fashion Week show in coordinated looks. Text: Erin McDowell It was a Stranger Things reunion at the Salvatore Ferragamo's Milan Fashion Week Show when Charlie Heaton and Natalia Dyer heated things up in the front row. The young Hollywood power couple looked right at home amongst Milan's fashion crowd as they took in Salvatore Ferragamo's latest collection. Heaton wore dark gray trousers with a hunter green sweater, while Dyer wore pieces from the latest collection handpicked for her by creative director Paul Andrew. Heaton and Dyer were joined by their Stranger Things costar, Joe Keery, and his actress girlfriend Maika Monroe. Let's just say, this was one uber-fashionable double date. The Ferragamo show marks the Fashion Week second show that Charlie Heaton and Natalia Dyer have attended together as a couple, despite Dyer being a regular at Fashion Week for the past two years. Charlie Heaton has been dating co-star Natalia since 2017, one year after the on-screen love interests began filming Stranger Things. They share a mutual love for fashion and are heavily inspired by the 80s styles they wear whilst filming the critically-acclaimed series. \"I think he did a great job,\" Dyer said of Paul Andrew's latest collection in a press statement. \"There were a lot of jumpsuits and very cool, wearable pieces — lots of big coats and bits of athleisure, which I always appreciate because I like to be comfortable.\" Check out our review of the best looks from the Salvatore Ferragamo FW19 show. \n",

Samuel Ross dedicates an eerie set to modernism in his proclaimed \"runway installation\" entitled BIRTH.ORGAN.SYNTH for Fall Winter 2019. Text: Brandon Tan Deemed a \"runway installation,\" entitled BIRTH.ORGAN.SYNTH, A-COLD-WALL*'s Fall Winter 2019 collection proved stimulating to say the least. The show's title is an obvious progression to its previous season, named HUMAN.FORM.STRUCTURE. This time around, Samuel Ross, the brand's creative director and founder, procured a set that froze time and took the audience into a sinister vortex of style. A moat surrounded the runway, with a mirrored obelisk lining the walk. What could be perceived as sweat ran down models' faces and at about half way down their slow-paced struts, each took an eerie look behind his shoulder. Consider us spooked. Once adjusted to the runway's ominous nature and the odd figures dancing about the shallow pool, the show becomes a sort of dark oasis. Suddenly, a Dobermann barks ferociously, dispelling the last ounces of ease from the audience--representative of societal fear, or perhaps an admonition for what was to come? Though initially on edge, the environment that had once distracted focus from the show began to inform it. In conversation with each other, the runway looks and set come together in  BIRTH.ORGAN.SYNTH, and the show does exactly what one would expect of fashion: to keep you on your toes. The \"Birth\" part of BIRTH.ORGAN.SYNTH leaned more towards \"The end is near,\" and if that's what the end looks like, so be it. Take me! That said, for the birth of a new chapter, comes an end to one prior, right? Then it's clear here, whether through the eerie presence or the stamping of \"Modernist\" across coats and bags, that A-COLD-WALL*'s FW19 collection welcomes modernism at the expense of traditionalism. Utilitarianism was certainly a focal point in the show, and unlike the relationship between modernism and traditionalism, there was no compromise to style. Ross continues to forge a strong front as an emerging designer, with distinct ideas and a fixed eagerness to display them in innovative manners. It's inspiring to see creative expression alive and well. Watch the full show below. \n",

      "Alexander McQueen showed its SS20 menswear line in a one-off exhibition at a former monastery. This was the first occurrence in a new McQueen initiative to show collections in different cities around the world, taking on London during its Fashion Week. The brand has a strong heritage: British by nature, disruptive by habit. This collection was in line with that heritage, adding vivid color and embellishments to otherwise traditional suits. Sharp, modern and stylish, these looks were cut for any evening. \n",
      "For the most part, the suits played with length and color. Some of the suit vents were uneven. One suit featured a vent in the style of a pleated skirt, extending below the knee. Other suits appeared ink-blotted with the design of a flower, consuming the vast majority of its jacket and pant legs. Florals were also featured on a button-down, embroidered into its chest. Another suit was quite literally petalled, with sheaths of fabric descending from the waist down to the knee in layers of black ruffles. But the collection's crown jewel took the phrase a bit literally: a black ensemble with a suit jacket covered completely in gems. \n",
      "It's women's eveningwear that typically receives an eye for glamour and ornamentation. However, in the case of the Alexander McQueen SS20 collection, extends that privilege to men too. \n",

      "If there aren’t florals or bold prints, it’s not a Dries Van Noten show. It’s a feature of the brand’s collections that we have come to expect, and once again, it delivered. The Belgian designer contributed further to his brand of botanical dandyism, but it felt different this season: less clean, less straightforwardly elegant; Dries Van Noten SS20 felt delightfully disheveled and dark. \n",
      "Like the flowers it co-opted, the collection was colorful. Suit jackets came in fuschia and slick trench coats in a grassy green. It was notably vibrant, unafraid of venturing past standard neutrals. The prints ranged from zebra to leopard and back to impressionistic flowers. Watching the collection trickle down the runway was like watching the assemblage of a spring bouquet. It wasn’t all sunshine and roses, a notable departure for Dries. Considerably more skin, draped chains and mesh featured heavily, leading to a less kempt look for the usually dapper designer. Alongside this change was a lean into femininity. Blazers were nipped at the waist, necklines swooped low, and shorts were cut above the mid-thigh. Though these attributes felt unique to this collection, they were presented in Dries Van Noten style. \n",
      "Dries Van Noten SS20 was true to form. It was bold, decorative and challenging. It’s not quintessential menswear – it takes male archetypes and infuses them with femme attributes. It plays somewhere in the middle of gender. Thanks to Dries, men can embrace their inner flowers, alluring passersby with color and styling that grabs eyes among a field of people. \n",

(& we’re going allllllll the way back to some collections you probably didn’t even know about.) So sit back (in your Supreme Inflatable Chair), snuggle up (with your Supreme Steiff Bear), pour yourself a drink (with your Supreme Sake set) & ENJOY. This one’s for you, hypebeast flex-ers. (*This is in no particular order, so calm down.*)   Supreme x Louis Vuitton Collection  Wow. Just WOW. This particular collection disrupted the high-fashion and streetwear worlds simultaneously. This was, debatably, the collection that started a revolution, in regards to luxury brands tapping into the streetwear/skating world, in a way that generated a response like never before.  One of the most grail worthy items that quickly captured the attention of all hype-beasts. The hand-painted porcelain cupid is seen uniting two hearts in love, all while wearing a box-logo tee. Who wouldn’t want this rare, tongue-in-cheek collectors item?  Supreme x The North Face There is no particular collection in this continuous collaboration that we could point out as being the best. Of course, some collections were better than others but the relationship between the two iconic brands, as a whole, deserves a spotlight of its own.  Can you imagine B.B. King, Slash or Santana jamming out on one of these bad boys? Ugh, we can only dream.  One of the first endeavors that Supreme took, in the world of high fashion. Many over-and-under hyped collections later, the relationship between the two labels remains a follower favorite.  Ideal for all those “make it rain” moments, but super messy because who’s going to clean up all those hundreds? Definitely not us.  An honorable mention from one of the older collections from ’08. Supreme was kind of ahead of their time in declaring that Visvim jackets are an important staple to have in one’s wardrobe.  Honorable mention because what the f*ck? and to make this drop even better, you guys actually bought this. Bravo. What an investment.  Supreme-ception. A Supreme tee of Kermit The Frog wearing a Supreme tee. 2008 was a fun year.  This one is for all of you adventurous hype-beasts. This was your chance to dominate the high seas in the flashiest way possible.  No stranger to the art world, Supreme commissioned one of the greats, Damien Hirst, for a collaboration. Think Box logo meets Hirst’s multi-colored spots.  One of the most major collaborations in Supreme history involved legendary New York-based artist Brian Donnelly, aka KAWS. His now-defunct OriginalFake label spotlighted the concept of “art as product”, making any piece from this collection a customer-cherished item.  “Mama said knock out out.” James Jebbia is apparently a huge boxing fan, so a collaboration with two brands was a no-brainer.    SKATE! BOARDS! Remaining true to the roots of the brand, Supreme teamed up with Artist George Condo to release a collection of beautifully striking boards. Who would ever dare use this to actually skate? Photo via ArtNet   Look Out Sucka! Would you mind if your partner takes a Supreme Louisville Slugger to both headlights and slashes a hole in all four tires?  This rare collaboration that no one ever really acknowledges, we feel should be explored a bit more. Quite a drastic shift in aesthetics for the skater-boy brand, Supreme went to legendary brand Schott to re-imagine the classic leather biker jacket that Schott is known for. Think: Fringe!  Basically, How To Get Robbed 101  One of those collections where Supreme actually created a super chic collection that can legitimately be worn anywhere, dressed up or down. Kudos to Supreme for polishing these boys up for a change.  Vroom Vroom, Skrrt Skrrt, & all that sh*t.  POP. ART. Supreme really went for the POW! factor with a collaboration with Artist Roy Lichtenstein. Another forgotten/overlooked collection that shows the ever expansive and visionary mind of Supreme.  Perfect for hiding your little treasures *wink wink*. Whatever they may be. (Also a clever disguise for anyone coming over to give the whole “in-touch-with-my-spritual-side” vibe.  If you didn’t get one of those, are you even a real NYC hype-beast?  In the 60’s, Playboy had a Chicago nightclub & club members received a Bunny adorned Playboy key, required for entry into the club, which quickly became a status symbol. Fast-Forward into the future, the brand launched a playboy capsule collection in 2011, which included a red-box version of the infamous key. (We wonder if it’ll work at the Playboy Mansion. Gotta call Holly, Bridget or Kendra and find out if they have one.) This domino set is perfect for going head-to-head in an intense game with someone’s grandpa in Union Square Park.  Supreme x Steiff  A childhood favorite amongst us all. The Supreme x Steiff teddy bear collaboration, in which the bear donned its own box logo hoodie, was by far the cuddliest and cutest in the 25 year run of the brand.                \n",

Originally a simple, canvas-bodied, rubber-soled basketball shoe by makers like Converse and Colchester, the kicks have now morphed into varying forms of styles, fabrics and even prestige. \n",
      "New York acts as a hub for said culture of hyped footwear, of which Stadium Goods, a Soho store specializing in sneakers, sits at the center, stocking some of the most collectible footwear on the market. The store's supervisor, Michael Louis-Juste, attributes the rise of the sneaker to a particular shoe, the Air Jordan 11 Concords \"from back in the day,\" first released in 1995. Celebrities ranging Mark Wahlberg to Dwayne Wade to Jay-Z rocked the kicks on the carpet, foreseeing a trend that we now see the emergence of across masses. Louis-Juste details, \"Most people and celebrities wore [the Concords] because they thought that they paired perfectly with a suit.\" The sneaker had raised so much in cultural value that it was seeing light as formalwear, a territory unseen prior. Today, we don't only see the Concords on the carpet, but also a range of designer sneakers from the runways to the streets, as well. Today's authorities of style, Timothée Chalamet and Kanye West to name a couple, are seen rocking all from Virgil's Vuitton West's own Yeezy line. \n",

      " The California festival has exclusive dibs on the highly-anticipated collab. The California festival has exclusive dibs on the highly-anticipated collab. Text: Brooke Kushwaha Takashi Murakami and Crocs? It's a match made in pop art heaven. The Japanese artist best known for his \"superflat\" mixture of high and low art styles has teamed up with the iconic waterproof shoe for the first time ever, and we're loving the results. The shoes will debut at the Complex Con Gift Shop, where Murakami will also display his latest art pieces alongside Madsaki from the Kaikai Kiki Gallery. While Murakami has dabbled in all forms and mediums, his commitment to 2D styles that mirror anime and manga has manifested into perhaps his most iconic image: the Murakami teddy bear. With the Complex Con Croc, Murakami has returned to the bear once again, along with all the psychedelic imagery that's become his calling card. His other famous icon, the smiling daisy, peek out more subtly on the strap, where the Croc logo normally stands. Murakami washes the entire shoe in multicolor camo, with black trim and soles to ground the trippy experience. Murakami has had a big year in the pop culture world. Back in March, the artist directed V cover star Billie Eilish's music video \"you should see me in a crown,\" which allegedly took him eight months to create. The video also drew heavily on anime influences, with Murakami's signature neon visuals. The Murakami Croc arrives just in time for Croc Day, and the announcement comes one week before Complex Con goes underway. The two-day music festival based in Long Beach is both a music festival and a larger cultural convention where fashion, art, and media intersect. This year the festival will take place from November 2nd to November 3rd, on the heels of Halloween. This first look is just one of the exclusive features and collaborations that Complex Con has to offer this year, but if you couldn't get a ticket, you can always try to score a pair off eBay. \n",

      " Meet Willie Norris, the artist who is using queer entrepreneurship as a means of defense. Meet Willie Norris, the artist who is using queer entrepreneurship as a means of defense. Text: Jack Reilly \n",
      "Willie Norris is an NYC based designer creating \"intentionally and holistically queer\" streetwear. Focusing on spreading queerness to elevate himself and his community, he has been working on an upcoming show that is strategically placed on June 13th, right in the middle of Pride month. This line is an inspiration to many in the queer community and making strides in the race to equality, practicing queer creation as a way to combat the marginalization of many sexualities and gender identities. \n",
      "The in-your-face designs feature a series of t-shirts that say things like “PROMOTE HOMOSEXUALITY” and “INCITE QUEERNESS,” which force you to consider your own identity, and how wearing these extremely blunt t-shirts leads to queer liberation and celebration. The line is inspired by, made for, and produced by LGBTQ+ people. Relying so heavily on the word “queer” and it’s importance to the community, Willie has created a social media campaign leading up to his show, where he has partnered with a network of queer artists to spread awareness and promote pride by supporting one another. \n",
      "In order to reach his goals, along with the social media campaign, Willie has created a Kickstarter where you can support the success of his show. If you are interested in learning more or supporting the cause, head to his Kickstarter page before May 12th. \n",
      "VMAN had an interview with Willie discussing why he created this brand and where he hopes to go with it, and he has given us an exclusive look at the work being released during the campaign. Get the first look here, and see what he has to say about it. \n",
      "When did you start this collection? What inspired you to start it? \n",
      "I've been doing this for about a year. What it is now in the simplest sense is a line of t-shirts. I know there’s nothing inherently special about having a t-shirt line, but I think t-shirts are super powerful and undervalued as a means of getting your message and propaganda out there. The idea behind it is really this kind of queer propaganda. If you look at my shirts they are very simple, very text-based, almost Russian or soviet union inspired. These are messages that you either are for it or you're not. There's no in between, no vagueness. Since I've been doing this, like every designer, I've had this craving to do a show. I have ten years of design experience so this is something I knew I could do. I wanted to really challenge myself, and I wanted to really challenge the fashion industry too. To really question what this idea of what a queer apparel brand could be. The reason I put it in the middle of June, not during any fashion week, is because this is not for the industry. More than anything it's a way to speak to my community. I put it during pride month very intentionally. Pride is sort of the 30 days of the year where brands will make their pander to the queer coin, and everyone knows it. What it boils down to is, it is one thing to have queer ambassadorship or even a queer CEO, but its another thing to have a completely and holistically queer business. And that's what I want. I want to build it from the ground up, not just place a gay face on top of what I'm doing. \n",
      "Your line so far has consisted of all of these t-shirts and hoodies, will your show include a bit more? What can we expect to see? \n",
      "I want to work slowly but intentionally, so I’m presenting a collection of jeans, t-shirts, and leather accessories. You’ll see a lot of denim and a lot of interpretation of what I think denim is and what it can be. Variations of t-shirts and t-shirt forms. Like, what does a t-shirt gown look like? Everyone understands what a t-shirt is and I want to mess that up a little bit. I’m introducing a kind of system of a leather wallet and bag that I'm calling the kit. I'm being hyperfocused on only including those materials. Nothing crazy, nothing techy, all really relatable and understood fabrics. I struggle a lot with saying menswear or womenswear because it seems like such an unnecessary classification, but it does sometimes help, so I like to say I'm doing menswear for all genders. \n",
      "One thing that really stuck with me about your work is the idea of being intentionally queer. You use the term “queer entrepreneurship as a means of defense.” Can you describe what you mean by that? \n",
      "That is kind of my brand's mission statement. I know how to make clothes, and I know how to work with fashion as a means of commerce. That being said, I can use that as a way to foster my community and people that identify with what I'm doing. I truly think that is a form of defense. If you're looking at my Instagram or wearing my clothes, you're part of a consumer culture. I want to use that to my advantage. If I'm going to play this game, I'm playing it for my people. I'm playing it as a way to bring up and support queer people. Even saying you're a queer person is kind of a radical thing so queer entrepreneurship that is made for queer people by queer people is a form of interacting and surviving in this world. \n",
      "Aside from this first show and the interaction with and support of the community, are there any other goals you have for the brand? Where do you want to take it? \n",
      "I want to practice what I preach. The only way to really do that via what I know is to have a business. The long term goal is to not fall into the trap of being a hyped up young designer who can make amazing runway clothes and then at the end of the day paying the bills by freelancing for someone else. I want to make a full collection of apparel that queer people can buy. That everyone can buy of course, but that is accessible. I want to truly engage with the fashion industry. And when I say that I mean the money behind it. I want to really create a viable business. I want to be like 80s Calvin Klein but queer and with guts. \n",
      "It’s interesting you say you want to make clothes that everyone can buy. Because right now it is very much made queer for queer. In the future how will you distinguish whats made for queer people and whats made for allies or straight people who want to buy it because it becomes trendy? \n",
      "That's a super good point. If I have my eyes on something bigger, I obviously have to think about that. It's unrealistic to say that I want to have a big business that is only going to be for one group of people. The way I know how to answer this is: first and foremost I am a product designer. I live for making really identifiable and distinct products. If I can make my version of a Levi’s 501 and sell thousands of them, I want to sell them to whoever wants to buy them. But the way that I can handle that is that my focus will always be on using any money that comes into supporting queer people. So you can buy my products, please do. I want straight people to buy them, I want allies to buy them, I don't want Trump supporters to buy them but that's a different thing. \n",
      "They’ll start buying them just to burn them. \n",
      "Exactly. That would honestly be iconic if someone did that. But no, the way I can handle it is that, that's just the nature of the game and open commerce. But I can keep up my message if I continue to use any excess funds or profit to solely benefit queer people. So everyone can support that, but know what you're supporting. \n",
      "It is definitely tricky, because someone may be buying it for the wrong reason, but at the end of the day they will still technically be supporting the cause, whether they know or not. \n",
      "And of course, I know I will never be able to have a company that exclusively employs queer people, that just not realistic. And that's not really my goal anyway. My goal is to have core queer values at the core of the business. \n",
      "Speaking of that, you are doing this campaign working with other queer artists and people. Can you talk about that? \n",
      "The campaign is called 30 days of gay. The idea behind the campaign is to get a photographer, an artist, someone I love, or just someone who makes good content, to put this t-shirt that I'm making (Promote Homosexuality) through their creative lens and just see what comes out. Its a way for me to collaborate with people, and it's a good way to introduce myself and my brand to a lot of other markets and people that would not necessarily have found me on their own. So yeah, there's a lot that I have been launching. Photos of me, people that I love, I have art that's coming out. I just really want as many people to know about me as humanly possible. If there is someone that could benefit from what I'm doing then I will do whatever I need to do to get myself to them. \n",

Saint Laurent's Spring 2020 Menswear collection combined classic men's tailoring and resort silhouettes, creating a Mick Jagger-inspired romp through androgyny. Text: Erin McDowell \n",
      "Saint Laurent Spring 2020 marked a turning point for the fashion house, as it turned away from quintessential New York style towards cities further afield. For his second Spring/Summer Menswear show, Anthony Vaccarello explains he drew inspiration from rock icon Mick Jagger and archival pieces. The creative director also called upon references from Marrakech, Morocco circa the 1970s, reimagined as a modern-day Los Angeles. \n",
      "“You come to LA for vacation,” Vaccarello said in a press statement, “and you can disconnect from the rest of the world.” Disconnect, show attendees did as an army of open-shirted, rhinestoned models marched down the runway in signature Saint Laurent style. \n",
      "The collection can only be described as a bohemian romp through androgyny. The fashion house seamlessly melds classic nighttime elements with silhouettes that appear at home in a resort collection. In classic Saint Laurent fashion, much of the collection stuck to a monochrome black-and-white palette. However, pops of denim, sheer detailing, and khaki elevated the mood. \n",
      "A modern Saint Laurent menswear collection wouldn't seem right without suits. In this regard, Vaccarello delivers. All-white suits and red rhinestoned dress pants brought glam rock to the runway. Meanwhile, metallic harem pants delivered Vaccarello's Moroccan inspiration. Upon first glance, it is immediately apparent that Saint Laurent Spring 2020 doesn't prescribe to a single gender. Rather, these party-ready pieces were made for anyone who can truly rock them.  \n",

      "Italian-based label Numero 00 was among the many designers who took the runway last week at Milan Fashion Week Men’s. Of the week’s many takeaways, one was particularly unsurprising—designers across the board used their shows to make a statement or push a progressive political agenda, namely, challenging conventional gender roles. \n",
      "Instead of fighting gender crusades, however, Numero 00’s political slant angled toward environmental consciousness. Designer Valerio Farina, who backs the label, outlined his inspiration from Ayurveda in a press release, which translates as the science of life. The traditional Indian system of health and medicinal knowledge asserts that the universe is made of five elements: space, air, fire, water and earth. \n",
      "Representations of these elements and an earthy color palette allude to Farina’s vision. If it’s not clear enough, garments sporting the definition of climate change are surely enough to make his sentiment crystal. \n",
      "Crisp, angular and practical are three words that come to mind in regard to Numero 00’s Spring Summer 2020 collection. Lightweight, organic and recycled fabrics are commonplace here. Anything that appears to be made of plastic, is actually made from PLA, or Polylactic acid, a polymer derived from plants. \n",
      "Sage greens and icy blues make appearances among the sea of neutral blacks, whites, greys and earth tones. Frequent drawstrings and minimalist piping add to the simplicity of the refined, contemporary line.

The Soundtrack to the show was a mix of music and voices. Snippets of songs were mixed with conversations, and interviews from David Bowie, Kurt Cobain, John Lennon, David Hockney, Francis Bacon, Iris Apfel, Christopher Isherwood, Yves Saint Laurent, and Jimi Hendrix guitar riffs. The show felt like an art manifesto as Noten introduced new ways to view men’s tailoring: nipped waists, squared shoulders and pleated trousers. \n",
      "Set in an industrial space, the show opened with a blue spotlight that faded to white as the first model took to the runway. The opening look set the tone for the show, clean, sharp, and relaxed tailoring. The show continued with popular Fall 2019 color trends such as navy, grey, and charcoal. The collection featured blazers, pleated pants, monochromatic tie-dye, V-neck sweaters, turn ups, dungarees, puffer jackets, and raincoats in hues of brown and cream. \n",
      "There was a focus on accessories with extra long belts, patent shoes, bags made from matching coat fabrics and colors.

      "The collection is aptly named to convey Palomo’s period of inspiration, namely the 20th century when Sergei Diaghilev’s ballet company Ballets Russes played a prominent role in Europe’s cultural landscape. Palomo’s sensual explorations reflect those of Diaghilev, and both creative minds share artistic visions that extend beyond traditional approaches. \n",
      "Tailored suits are coupled with flowing silhouettes and topped off with voluminous collars and bows. Contrasting textures and colors are laid against black, which is a color that’s new to Palomo’s palette. \n",
      "Palomo’s explorations can be seen literally through their past Spring 2019 collection, \"Wunderkammer\", which took fashion elements and accessories from different geographical regions throughout Europe. Continuing from their last, Palomo’s newest collection is fitting for their expansive presence in the industry, as the brand’s collections are shown throughout the world from Madrid to New York. \n",

It’s 10 degrees in New York—so bone-chilling outside that it’s even bone-chilling inside—and Mark Ronson is sitting in Studio C of the Electric Lady Studios in the West Village, putting the finishing touches on his fifth album, Late Night Feelings, his tall, lithe frame slumped in a chair and wrapped up in a heavy shearling. Frost be damned, he hunches over a mixing board and pulls up a song, staring off into the distance while listening for elements to change or get rid of. He is a producer and songwriter, not a singer or rapper, and so this part of the process—finding an album’s exact sound—is Ronson’s mastery.     “I’d say the record was done, then think, is this bad? Am I just conning people?,” says Ronson, who, at 43, is angularly handsome with a wall of pompadoured hair. “But [you have to] be painstaking.” Late Night Feelings, in its aura of introspection, is something of a departure for Ronson. Though he has long been capable of creating deeply emotional work on other people’s albums—like Amy Winehouse’s despondent 2006 masterpiece Back to Black, which he coproduced—he has generally stayed in party mode on his own projects, like 2015’s Uptown Special, which featured “Uptown Funk” with Bruno Mars, a winking and excitable funk throwback that has racked up 3.5 billion views on YouTube. Before hitting it big as a producer in his own right, he was known as a DJ, and has an instinct for keeping the mood elevated.         Late Night Feelings has all the hallmarks of Ronson’s oeuvre, including an A-team of talent to perform the songs, in this case Miley Cyrus, Camila Cabello, Lykke Li, and Angel Olsen. Since going from the DJ booth to the recording studio in the early 2000s, Ronson has refined a glittering sweet spot that he says is “somewhere in between dance and R&B and pop.” The new track with Cabello, for instance, is a sugary slice of ’80s synth. But the album also has a truly tender touch. Since his divorce from ex-wife, the model Joséphine de la Baume, in 2017, everything he’s felt like creating has had a softer underbelly. “I was going through it. I was overwhelmingly melancholy,” he says. “Because of songs like ‘Uptown Funk,’ I’m always like, no, I’m a DJ, no one wants to hear [feelings] from me. Then the minute that I actually let my emotions into the music, it was the only thing that resonated.” Still, in keeping with his DJ’s intuition, he was as interested in reading the room as he was in analyzing his own psyche, and he wanted the “late night feelings” behind the album’s title to be less specific to his own life than they are emblematic of the stresses that keep most people awake at all hours. It’s an album that’s more empathic than strictly personal—a mirror as much as a diary, sung by a cast of characters who all bring their own experience to the mic. “You know that feeling when you are trying to get to sleep and then two, three AM rolls up, you start to see dawn cracking, and you’re like, how the fuck am I going to get through tomorrow?” he says. “It’s about anything that leaves you unable to sleep. Heartbreak, anxiety, lust, bills, disdain for the world, the state of America.”         Which isn’t to say Late Night Feelings is maudlin. Many of the songs are, as he has labeled them, “sad bangers,” the kind to sweat out your pain to. “It still has to dance and move and be a tiny bit shiny,” he says. ”I’m not completely abandoning my box in the DJ section of the record store.” Take “Nothing Breaks Like a Heart,” the album’s first single sung by Miley Cyrus, a beautiful ode to forlorn 1970s country done with a glitzy and contemporary disco twist. “The longing is there, the heart is in the voice, but there’s still killer basslines and drums,” he says. “I need to know that I’ve reinforced [a song] with everything that’ll give it a chance. What’s the point in getting Miley Cyrus to deliver this amazing vocal if you’re not going to ensure that it’s gonna fuckin’ bang?” He is finishing Late Night Feelings all while gearing up for the Academy Awards. His work on “Shallow,” performed by Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper for A Star is Born is favored to win Best Original Song after snagging the Golden Globe (at press time, the final winner had not yet been announced). He first worked with Gaga on her album Joanne, and those sessions turned into him writing on “Shallow,” but he’s known her—and that she’s the real deal—for about a decade. “[When we met], she was just starting to blow up, and I was like, ‘Do you want to come out with me and my friends in London?’ We ended up at a loft apartment in East London,” he remembers. “She instantly went to a piano. There’s 30 people [there], nobody knows who she is, she’s wearing this skin-colored latex outfit, she’s playing some chords, and [we have] a jam session. I think five o’clock came around, and she was still there.” He is characteristically pragmatic about his Oscar nod. “I was in Terminal 5 about to take a JetBlue flight at 8 in the morning when I found out I was nominated,” he says. “It’s an incredible accolade, but you still have to board a plane. Just get on with life, just keep doing the things that got you there to begin with.” Which is exactly what he’s up to here in this studio on a freezing cold Monday in January. “I think that continuing to care about the quality of the music, and working with incredibly talented people, is a good formula. I know I’m a 43-year-old dude making pop music. I’m aware my shelf life should may be over,” he says. “You have to prove yourself.” And with that, he queues up another track.         \n",

      "Tyler Blue Golden is a kind of alt scene golden boy. The young model has been skating since he was 10 years old, and competing for over a decade. His skating sponsorship at age 15 has led him to the world of fashion, where he's seen his two passions overlap more and more. Now, Golden has partnered with Gucci for the first time for their release of the Gucci Grip, a genderless watch line. In an exclusive interview with VMan, Tyler sat down to talk about skate life and his experience with the iconic Italian brand. \n",
      "As skating gains mainstream popularity once again, Golden notes that branded partnerships have been an important door-opener for skaters into the larger pop culture sphere. \n",
      "\"Seeing other industries like fashion, film and all those types of things embrace skate culture is only is only a good thing,\" Golden said. \"You know, like a lot of my favorite skaters ride for skate companies. I think the more people see skateboarding as a viable activity or something that's cool or interesting, the more that that boosts sales, and ultimately, that's how favorite skaters of mine make their living. In my eyes, it's really doing a lot of good and it's spreading the idea of skating and how fun and cool that is.\" \n",
      "[embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/B3hxfcXAzdk/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link[/embed] \n",
      "For Golden, it's important that brands capture skating in an authentic and natural way. With his partnership with Gucci, Golden believes that the fashion house has done their due diligence, and given him free reign when needed. \n",
      "\"They really gave me a lot of creative control, which I think only benefited like the overall look and feel of the photos and videos,\" he said. \"They were really hospitable and accommodating to what I needed from them. And so in that sense, there was a lot of freedom to go and, you know, pick locations and people to be a part of it and whatnot. And within that, because I did have that hand in things, I feel like it ultimately became more of a natural product. For me as a skateboarder looking at this from that perspective, you get a more authentic result.\" \n",
      "Golden hopes his work with Gucci will help bring skating to a wider audience than ever before. \n",
      "\"It's great that people like Gucci have involved skating on such a global scale,\" he shared. \"And I think that things like that are, again, in a similar vein, only really good for skating in the long run, in terms of [giving] a platform. It's just really, you know, it can do no wrong. And if somebody sees it on Gucci and then all of a sudden decides to buy a skateboard, then maybe that will become their origin story.\"  \n",

      "The artwork on the bottle consists of the Andreas Kronthaler for Vivienne Westwood logo, a love heart, the brand’s iconic orb logo on both the neck and the bottom of the bottle, and, most notably an original 1970 Vivienne Westwood statement graphic in red that reads “Let it Rock.” The graphic has immense significance within the brand; it was first created in 1971 when Vivienne Westwood began designing with Malcolm McLaren. It’s reminiscent of a time when London was the leader in cultural trends. The shop that showcased their designs at 430 Kings Road, London came to be known as “Let it Rock,” when it shifted to 1950s Rock n Roll records and clothing, a refreshing departure from the aesthetics of the time. The slogan and graphic represent the brand’s ingenuity and subversive ethos.  \n",
      "The artwork is inked directly onto the glass bottle so it appears as vivid and bold as it was intended to. “We’re always seeking new ways to bring innovative and exciting celebratory experiences to our fans, and our collaboration with Vivienne Westwood and INKD is going to do just that,” remarked Natalie Wills, the global head of CÎROC vodka. “We love to collaborate with partners with similar values and just like CÎROC Vivienne Westwood is continually pushing and redefining the meaning of modern luxury.” \n",

      "The art of the readymade—or the filtering of non-art through an elevated context—pervades the latest Helmut Lang drop, an extension of the brand’s “Logo Hack” series featuring Russian-American artist Slava Mogutin. The installment is comprised of two subcollections, “Helmut Go-Go” and “Stock Boyz”— extensions in themselves of Mogutin’s unabashedly queer artistic practice. While the series’s title may imply a pre-existing framework, Helmut Lang’s famously modest “logo” offers a carte blanche for collaboration, reflecting, in Mogutin’s case, a range of readymade queer iconography, from adult entertainers to male-wrestler silhouettes.  \n",
      "Since fleeing Russia’s anti-gay climate in the mid-90s (and becoming the first Russian citizen to gain U.S. asylum on such grounds) Mogutin’s work has foregrounded queer sexuality and gender, collapsing seemingly disparate subcultures in the process. “Helmut Go-Go, ” an implicit reference to Mogutin’s mockumentary-like 2017 portraits of Helmut Lang-wearing go-go boys, appropriates the utilitarian design of technical uniforms, while “Stock Boyz” layers eroticized male wrestlers under rows of stock exchange figures.  \n",
      "The erotic readymade plays a functional role in queer art: after years of institutional marginalization, the readymade offers a means of dramatically centering queer sexuality. This process is still underway, as the Wade Guyton show at Galerie Chantal Crousel, not far from the original Helmut Lang HQ, is currently demonstrating with a blown-up XVideos scene entitled “Gay sailors enjoy piece of navy cakes.” Mogutin went one step further, casting adult film actor Sean Ford in his “Logo Hack” collection’s self-shot lookbook.

      " The highly anticipated drop sparked controversy in the sneaker world The highly anticipated drop sparked controversy in the sneaker world Text: Vienna Vernose After a long wait, musical artist Travis Scott finally released his highly-anticipated Air Jordan 6 “Cactus Jack” collaboration this weekend. Rumors first sparked about the forthcoming collaboration during the rappers Super Bowl 53 halftime performance back in February, and as of this weekend, it’s finally up for grabs. Featuring a dusty olive suede upper with black, white, and gray detailing. One of the unique focal points of the shoe is the tactical mini pouch on the left side of the shoes drawing on Scott’s taste for the utilitarian trend. The rapper’s Cactus Jack signature is featured on the heel and inner tongue of the shoe with an added glow-in-the-dark sole.  Offered in four sizes, the sneakers went up for sale this past weekend with a retail price of $250 for adults, $160 USD for grade school; $80 USD for preschool; and $60 USD for toddlers at select retailers and globally on Nike’s SNKRS app. However, the collaboration sold out in minutes with resale market users soon reselling the shoes for upwards of $1,000, four times its original retail price on sites like Grailed and StockX.  Frustrated fans who were unable to get their hands on a pair took to social media to discuss the greater issue with resale marketplaces dominating the system. A Travis Scott let out his grievances on Instagram in a post addressed to Nike and Scott touching on prioritizing “real fans” to be able to purchase the shoes first rather than “resellers using devices to cheat the system.” Several thousand users resonated with the statement, including Scott himself commenting “Ur voice won’t go unheard.” The situation speaks to a larger issue of resellers saturating the majority of the market giving customers no other choice but to purchase an upsold version. While the drop still remains sold out on Nike retailers, it seems Scott is working to change the system in which the high-profile collaboration is sold so that all fans are able to get a piece. \n",

Accompanying the accessories, models wore neon color tags that were labeled with the words “bored”, “sad”, “excited”, and “confused”. \n",
      "The show revolves around the word “confused”. This shows of course in a literal sense, with the tags worn by the models, but you can see the sense of confusion throughout the show.

Japanese designer Jun Takahashi took his label, UNDERCOVER, in a new direction this summer in his third menswear show of the decade. Take a look. Text: Teddy Willson \n",
      "UNDERCOVER went into Paris Fashion Week Men’s with a reputation for theatrical, themed collections that err on the side of costume rather than high-end dress. The Spring Sumer 2020 collection, however, managed to achieve the dramatics that the label is known for, this time in a wearable format. \n",
      "The show in Paris was only UNDERCOVER’s third menswear show in the past decade—the brand’s menswear lines are typically only presented as lookbooks. Weary of his costume-like designs, Japanese designer Jun Takahashi decided to take UNDERCOVER in a different direction, putting womenswear on pause while he focused on making a name for himself in menswear. \n",
      "For this season, Takahashi continued to mine culture’s past for inspiration. Through references, both subtle and direct, Takahashi partook in unconventional storytelling via his clothes. UNDERCOVER’s Spring Summer 2020 collection borrowed from the 1929 horror film Nosferatu, as well as American photographer Cindy Sherman’s iconic Untitled Film Stills series from the late 1970s. \n",
      "The nearly all-black collection was dark in spirit. Spiderweb dress shirts carried a menacing ambiance, while pleated coats alluded to a leather bondage situation. The looming figure of Nosferatu’s infamous Transylvanian vampire and an ominous crescent moon made regular appearances on the front of blazers, coats and semi-cropped, short sleeve shirts. Sherman’s black and white films were pressed onto the front of simple bomber jackets, shirts, t-shirts, coats and sweaters alike. \n",
      "The show itself possessed a sinister aura. Eerie, haunting music played as the models traced down the runway, expressionless and grim. The entire presentation protected UNDERCOVER’s staple dramatics with a refined and stylish look. If this collection is any indication of what we can expect from Takahashi’s new direction, then we have reason to keep our eyes glued. \n",

Text: Teddy Willson Product-release day is just any other day in the world of Virgil Abloh. The Off-White designer and artistic director of menswear at Louis Vuitton has been moving full steam ahead, from LV’s Lower-East Side pop-up to the worldwide availability of Off-White’s Pre-Fall 19 women’s collection. A new Off-White sneaker is the latest in Abloh’s steady stream of releases. The shoe is a variation of the label’s wildly popular Off-Court sneaker. Made of a leather-cotton-polyamide blend, the sneaker has a high-top style. The “high-top” part of the shoe has a soft, sock-like quality to it. Off-Court’s iconic orange and black patches remain, as does the practical rubber role. Beige laces add a touch of simplicity and chic to the footwear. The real highlight of the sneaker is its iridescent turquoise details on either side. The color is a bright complement to the neon orange patches, while the iridescent material will easily catch the sunlight, giving sneakerheads that necessary #glow. The shoe, which retails for about $580, is available online now. \n",

      "The verb, “to represent,” has become a kind of cultural super-entendre, meaning to pledge allegiance, be true to oneself, to support cultures outside one’s own, et cetera. But to George and Mike Heaton, the sibling founders of the British brand Represent, the name refers to something more specific: “[It’s] a story of our lives seen through garments,” says Mike, 27.  \n",
      "The U.K.-made line is deeply rooted in British craftsmanship. Launching in 2012 with t-shirts, the collection took inspiration from a single pair of jeans made by the Heatons' grandmother, a tailor by trade. “She re-made a pair of jeans I wore in my late teens,” says George, 25. “That really set the brand off [to create] a perfectly fitting jean.” \n",
      "Now spanning full men’s and womenswear collections, the luxury-leaning line reps everything from the Heatons’ gran to the British aristocracy; the “R” logo is a riff on the Rolls-Royce insignia. “It’s is a completely different world and product,” says Mike, “But the ethos and craftsmanship is a real inspiration.”  \n",
      "But if Represent is a representation of anything, it’s of the viral currency of streetwear culture, which originated in Japan and soon spread to SoHo before its eventual British invasion, with brands like Burberry dropping sporty collections earlier this year. And while the name Represent may not be a call to action, the designs seem to be enough to compel high-profile fans, from Hailey Baldwin to Young Thug, to rep the Heatons’ clothes. “Everything we design is what we’re either missing or what we can develop further,” says Mike.  \n",
      "And who better to represent this spread than the American prince of streetwear himself? Below, flip through the lookbook for Represent’s latest capsule, starring Luka Sabbat. \n",

      "Bridging science camp (as in the summertime rite of passage for sports-averse youth) and camp-as-in-campy, Francesco Ragazzi’s SS20 collection for Palm Angels went heavy on the semiotics of eco-tourism, from butterfly and hibiscus-flower motifs to abstracted leis worn as neckwear.  \n",
      "If Palm Angels is the warm-climate-skewing pupil of Moncler, for whom Ragazzi served as art director, the SS20 range reflected that like-father-like-son, sportswear-meets-resortwear mandate, complete with durable statement pieces like amber-hued cyclops shades and duck-billed rubberized trainers. These modern angles, combined with well-trod leisuretime tropes like the Hawaiian shirt, conjured a distinctly ’90s father-son duo—perhaps unabashedly blowing off steam by catching butterflies. A perfect arrival to coincide with Father’s Day festivities, the collection proved simultaneously nostalgic for a simpler time while looking forward to a freer future.  \n",

Combining a distressed suede with a tejus printed leather, coupled with mesh trims and reflective details, each contrasting element draws eyes to the Ultrapace’s bold originality. \n",

The  Ultrapace sits on a tricolor rubber sole, connected by a hand-colored midsole and terry cloth lining, while the uppers are composed of a variety of materials including metallic leather, Lavaredo fabric, and suede depending on the colorway. Tying the varying components together, an old-school Gucci logo adorns the sneaker's tongue and embroidered “GUCCI” lettering completes the outside of the shoe. Found first on Michelle’s Fall 2019 runway, the low-top Ultrapace was followed by a mid/high-top version at the Gucci 2019 Cruise Show featuring an elevated design with a velcro strap. Each iteration of the Ultrapace is completely different to the next, providing  ample styling options and a colorful, walking statement piece. \n",

Embracing everything menswear has not been lately, Craig Green brought a loud, bright and complex collection to London Fashion Week for SS20. Text: Julian Wright \n",
      "Menswear has become increasingly simple. The influence of streetwear from brands like Off-White and Supreme have stripped men down to baggy basics and brandished logos. The modern man has welcomed this style with open arms, but it's not the only one being well-received. Craig Green proved this in London with his SS20 menswear line. \n",
      "Green didn't shy away from elaborate ensembles. In fact, those may have been the only things seen traveling down the runway. The designer said his inspiration came from the self-gaze and visual inspection one confronts in the mirror. Justly, the garments in this collection matched anatomy, with pieces featuring ribbing and padding to match natural muscular lines. The closing garments even went as far as to add a superimposed male body to their exteriors. \n",
      "Green wasn't always so literal. He attacked his motif with a more grandiose approach by amplifying and extending elements of the body with his use of structure and color. Large gingham cloaks shrouded models with baggy movement. Translucent plastic garments, reminiscent of Mexican Easter Lanterns, heightened and broadened shoulders. These large outfits left many bodies amorphous, directing attention away from the figure and towards color or structure. \n",

      " The veteran multi-hyphenate is back with a blinged-out song and vid. The veteran multi-hyphenate is back with a blinged-out song and vid. Text: SAMUEL ANDERSON The recent boon of “K-Pop” and “J-Pop” fandoms, specifically within the Western zeitgeist, is undeniable. But contrary to the suggestion of the qualifying labels applied to East Asian pop-cultural exports—that they are a hybrid of non-Western influences and some overarching “Pop” landscape—they in fact reflect something less like opposing slices of a Venn diagram suddenly colliding and more like a mutual interplay dating back eons.  One modern case study in \"East-meets-West\" binary-breaking is Verbal, a Tokyo-born MC of Korean descent who’s been slicing and dicing cultural and disciplinary bounds for two decades. A founding member of pioneering Japanese hip-hop group M-Flo (“The Asian Fugees,” he calls them), Verbal is also a driving force behind cross-cultural touchstones as Teriyaki Boyz, of The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift-fame, and Ambush, a rockstar jewelry brand he shares with wife and Dior Men jeweler Yoon Ahn.  Today, Verbal’s latest co-production, PKCZ®, releases its single, “Cut It Up” featuring 2NE1 alum CL and Dutch DJ Afrojack. In a prime example of pop-cultural reverse engineering, the song’s video follows the format of the epically choreographed bloodbath in Quentin Tarantino’s Kill Bill Vol. I, and even features some of the original fight sequence’s extras, as we learned in a conversation with Verbal shortly after his Met Gala appearance.  Here, he reflects on his hyphenate-packed CV, spanning music, design and more, from catching a young Kanye West’s eye with a particular piece of jewelry to lessons in marketing learned from Madonna. On breaking into the music industry as a kid Before we started M-Flo, Taku, my friend since fifth grade, and I would send demo tapes to TV shows, which got us pretty far. We won competitions and got offers from record companies, but we never took them; rapping as a career wasn't realistic for an asian kid in the 90s. And neither of our parents approved, so we just went off to college. Long story short, we got back together [after school], and that's when we [met our vocalist Lisa] and made our first record as M-Flo, Planet Shining. On the J-Pop industry back in the day When I started my career with M-Flo, in 1999, we were very independent even though we were signed to management. I think my marketing degree came into play, in the sense that we were able to design our way of being viewed. The first thing they taught us in the marketing major was Madonna, and the whole art of evolution. In Japan at the time, it was very rare for a bilingual group to exist. We were people of all backgrounds—I’m of Korean descent, Taku is Japanese, and Lisa is half-Colombian, half-Japanese. Now it’s kind of the norm, even in Japan, but back then they didn’t know what to make of us. We were rapping and singing in Japanese and in English. It was new. On landing on the Fast & Furious: Tokyo Drift soundtrack [Teriyaki Boyz] was a totally different group [from M-Flo]—a bunch of friends from high school, and from clubs and parties, including [A Bathing Ape founder] Nigo. Nigo had a track from DJ Shadow, so he was like, you guys wanna do something with it? So we laid our vocals down, and the rest is history. Universal wanted us to make a whole album. So we got Daft Punk, Kanye, Pharrell, and all these people to write for us. [It was based on] a sort of American rendition of the Japanese Bosozoku culture—Bosozoku is a bike gang. I think back then, that was a good enough image of what Japan and Asia was like [to translate to a U.S. audience]. We just thought it was cool because it was something so foreign to us, [too]. On meeting and designing for Kanye West  This was way before Yeezy, in 2005 or 2006—back in the day when he wanted to become an intern at Fendi. We met at a dinner with Silvia Fendi—he was in Japan with [her]. He came into the restaurant, and I had on this chain, my rendition of a [cross] but it was like Michael Jackson. Immediately he came in and he goes “What is that?” I said, I just made it for fun. He goes “Make me one but bigger.” So that’s when we started [collaborating]. He still approaches us for our design work. We are always talking about design, so we'll send him Ambush stuff, or my wife [Yoon Ahn] will send him her jewelry for Dior Men. On \"Cut It Up\" and the Tarantino effect Of course, we’re big fans [of Tarantino]. The song is called “Cut It Up,” so I thought, why not have people swinging swords around, like in the Kill Bill scene? It was just an idea. But to reproduce a Tarantino-esque sequence can come off as tacky, if it's not done right. So we found actual Kill Bill [stunt performers]—master swordsmen, who taught the people in the movie, to be part of the video. We tried to get [access to] the actual set, where Uma Thurman fought all those [assassins], but they wouldn't rent it out to us. So we created a set to look just like it. On meeting wife and Ambush collaborator Yoon Ahn [We both went to] school in Boston, and I met her in church. Korean people go to church! My friend, in the hallway one day, was like “You gotta come to church.” I was like, okay. I just tagged along. And that’s where I met her, and then I had asked her to come to Japan. She didn't want to come without knowing what she would do. And that’s when I started the company, Ambush—so that we could work on it together. She thought it was a good deal, so that's how [it all] started. We didn't intend for the brand to become what it is today! Stream \"Cut It Up\" here \n",

The LVMH Prize-winning, British-Jamaican designer was among Dior’s collaborative lineup of creatives. Text: Emma Li Maria Grazia Chiuri, creative director of Dior, showcased the fashion house's cruise collection yesterday in the North African city of Marrakesh. Chiuri’s desire to explore pan-African craftsmanship led her to collaborate with anthropologist Anne Grosfilley, Ivory Coast fabric manufacturer Uniwax, and British-Jamaican designer Grace Wales Bonner. Grace Wales Bonner, founder of London-based menswear label Wales Bonner, is the recipient of the 2016 LVMH Prize. Born in Southeast London into a multi-ethnic family, Bonner’s European and African heritage serves as an important element in her collections, which explore representations of black male sexuality and identity. While she was still enrolled at Central Saint Martins, Bonner assisted Vogue fashion editor Camilla Nickerson in New York. Bonner’s collection “Afrique” featured a cast of black male models and won the L'Oréal Professional Talent Award. A year later, she was awarded the Emerging Menswear Designer at the British Fashion Awards. Bonner’s work has been presented at the Victoria and Albert Museum as well as the Serpentine Gallery. Her multimedia exhibition “A Time for New Dreams” at the Serpentine Gallery impressed Chiuri, who asked to meet Bonner in Paris to discuss collaboration. The collaboration recently took form through Bonner’s reiteration of the Bar jacket and New Look skirt for Dior’s Cruise 2020 Collection. The jacket’s embellishments draw from native Caribbean cultures that hold a special place in Bonner’s heart while her matching skirt design is a graphic piece that intersects masculinity and femininity. Many women are attracted to Bonner's collections despite the designer's focus on menswear. Now, they’re presented with Bonner's reinterpretations of iconic Dior silhouettes. \n",

While his technical savvy would lead him to the carefully calibrated art of photography, McDean remains an unabashed car buff, having documented supermodels and muscle cars with equal rigor for years.  \n",
      "These dual passions collide at high speed in Manual, McDean’s new Rizzoli book. Expanding on the conceit of his 20-year-old book, 1999’s I Love Fast Cars, McDean’s Manual juxtaposes runway looks and burning rubber, while reprising his gear-head tendencies. Nestled among lush editorials for the likes of French Vogue and Yohji Yamamoto are a photo series of engine parts, extracted by McDean via band saw from a Chevy V8. While the gritty series, inspired by Damien Hirst’s \"Mother and Child (Divided),\" may starkly contrast with McDean’s fashion photography, it also reveals the nuts-and-bolts process behind the effortless sheen: “I lay it out as I shoot it,” McDean says in the book of his fashion stories. “It’s creating a visual sentence, from the start to the finish.”  \n",
      "Coinciding with the launch of the book is a fashion collaboration between McDean and a fellow adrenaline seeker, Byredo’s Ben Gorham. Reflecting McDean's practice, the hybrid collection splices Byredo apparel with the book's wide-ranging imagery. Ahead of the capsule collection’s New York launch, McDean walks us through his horse-powered drops.  \n",

      "Craig McDean My father worked for Roll-Royce, and was always renovating old cars, so I [learned about] mechanics through him. I also raced motorcycles from a young age, but by the time I was 16 or 17, I wasn’t good enough for professional motocross. My father said, “What are you going to do?” and got me a job at his friend’s garage. But I was not really built for it [laughs]. I wasn’t destined to do mechanic work all my life, but it’s how I paid for college, eventually. \n",
      "But [the book] is [really] a throwback to my days of going clubbing and photographing my friends, who’d dress up on the weekends, [in the styles of] David Bowie or Boy George, when we went clubbing. At night I would photograph my friends, and [by day] I was racing motorcycles and taking pictures at these racing events. I would always carry an Olympus half-frame camera, and just take peoples’ portraits. This was before I had any idea I would be a photographer [professionally].  \n",
      "So the book is a mashup of these things. It’s not forced; it’s an extension of my life.  \n",
      "VMAN Was there something about American cars that appealed to you, as opposed to English cars?  \n",
      "CM Oh god, yeah. I grew up around a Ford Cortina, this really boring, basic English car... That’s what my father drove. So the size of muscle cars, and the sheer beauty of the design [appealed to me]. And films like [Steve McQueen’s] Bullitt really romanticized them. It was that period, from 1965 to ’72, when all those great muscle cars came out: the Camaros, the Shelby Cobras... For me, growing up in Manchester, I was like, “I have to have one of these…” And [that’s what I did]. When I first moved to America, I bought a muscle car, and went car racing. And that’s what my first book, I Love Fast Cars, came from.  \n",
      "VMAN Do you still own muscle cars?  \n",
      "CM Muscle cars weren’t very well-made; the breaks were terrible. You could never stop the thing… They were god awful [to drive]. They were great to race, great at serving their purpose, but I’ve sold most of my muscle cars, yeah. Now I mostly collect Italian cars.  \n",
      "VMAN Like what?  \n",
      "My favorite car, and one I have had for a while, is my Maserati Ghibili Spyder. It’s one of the first cars I bought, and still always puts a smile on my face. It’s such a beautiful machine to drive. \n",
      "VMAN Tell us about your partnership with Byredo.  \n",
      "CM Ben [Gorham] is a dear friend of mine, and I have been shooting the Byredo advertisements for a long time. Two years ago, Ben made a line of handbags, and based them on some of my car pictures… So for [Manual], Ben said, lets create merchandise to go along with the book.  \n",
      "Ben left it quite open to me; he was like, “Pick four images you’d want to go on a scarf.” We also made hats and beer coolers… it’s very American [laughs].  \n",
      "VMAN Does Ben like cars?  \n",
      "CM He does love cars actually, yes! He likes cars very much. He’s got a couple of convertible Land Rovers that are pretty out-there. I think they could [travel] to the Antarctic.  \n",
      "VMAN It seems like cars are just getting pushed out by various factors. People ride-sharing, et cetera… Do you think all the golden eras of cars are over?  \n",
      "CM I think eventually everything will be electric, and I don’t think that’s a bad thing. I just wish America was as forward thinking as European cities. Like if you [need to] charge a car, there should be places to charge it. I think it’s great to have electric cars and less emissions. I am down for that. But [if that doesn’t happen], maybe it will be illegal drive cars one day. They will just become relics in a museum. \n",

      "Fendi’s autumn/winter 2019 collection, which was shown at Milan Fashion Week Men’s, featured tailored suits mixed with playful embellishments. True to the dualism expected from the fashion house, the collection seemed to evoke both boyish fun through its sense of humor, and suave maturity through its broad silhouettes and avant garde flourishes. \n",
      "In many ways a tribute to Karl Lagerfeld (who also worked on the collection), it especially demonstrates Lagerfeld’s innovations in menswear. Several elements mirror Lagerfeld’s own style, while others take inspiration from his past collaborations with Fendi and his other work. The collection is heavily reminiscent of 70s style formal wear but still riffs off of modern trends; it is both nostalgic and futuristic all at once. \n",
      "Laden with delightful enigmas like this (such as mixing neutrals with metallics, and the abundant asymmetry in an area of fashion typically known for its balance and consistency), the true genius of the collection lies in its recognition that wearing a suit is revolutionary in a world dominated by streetwear. As Silvia Venturini Fendi said, “Today, for a young kid, or for somebody who didn’t experience it before, to be in a suit and tie is the most subversive attire.” The collection brings the classiness of a bygone era into the streetwear age, with iridescent pinstripes adorning sweaters and contrasting pockets adding dimensionality to trousers. These contemporary twists were also inspired by Lagerfeld’s expertise in making tailoring timeless. \n",
      "Like modern culture, it tweaks the nose of tradition/history while simultaneously celebrating it. Not only is reintroducing the tailored suit to a generation who has perhaps grown unfamiliar with it brilliantly metaphorical, it, along with the heavily prominent return to classical styles this season, ushers in an era of reclaimed tradition.   \n",

      "Once Disney child stars and still twin brothers, Cole and Dylan Sprouse, will make you do a double take as they take on the fashion industry à la Olsen Twins. But unlike the latter pair, the former never abandoned their acting craft while making a foray into different avenues of the arts, like photography and breaking the internet with social media banter. \n",
      "This time, they’re breaking into jeans: J Brand assigned Cole, who acts as Jughead on CW’s retro Archie comic throwback, Riverdale, with the task of manning the lens that captures Dylan. And just like the Olsen twins, The Sprouse brothers personify retro, but in a purely Americana way, embodying the vibe of J Brand’s latest campaign. \n",
      "“I prefer a classic western style of jeans. I like simplicity with my jeans so I think logoless t’s or tanks tucked into the belt line is my standard. I think jeans should generally be worn with boots or cuffed at the bottom if worn with sneaks or (if you like freedom) sandals,” Dylan said. \n",
      "Echoing America’s motto of freedom, Dylan and J Brand deviate from the reemergence of logo-laden fashion collections. Instead, the campaign embodies the classic look and feel of jeans as portrayed by Dylan who sports a slicked-back hairstyle not unlike The Fonz. His hands peek out of a swung open camel-colored blazer and are tucked into jean pockets, metal-capped pointy-toe cowboy boots peeking out from underneath leg-skimming jeans. In another photo, Dylan dons a plain black tee and ripped, light-washed jeans. The backdrop? A non-descript highway on a rocky terrain. He seems to be mid-cracking his knuckles. \n",
      "“While this medium is entirely different than acting, I’m familiar with Cole's photography so I’m aware of what would compliment it as the subject,” he said. He was also aware of the humorous jabs that his brother would throw his way, but what he wasn’t privy of was Cole's professionalism – the kind that probably landed him major editorials. \n",
      "If this duo has anything to say about it, every good American needs to get a pair of their own J Brand jeans this season.

      "Descending from the tony hills of Los Angeles, Anwar Hadid and Yoni Laham share ties to a close-knit circle of pedigreed supermodels: Anwar, the youngest of the power-modeling Hadid clan, and Laham, a Beverly Hills-born musician, were introduced by mutual friends. Two and a half years later, they are the co-owners of the newly minded jewelry brand Martyre, which offers a rugged spin on L.A. sheen.  \n",
      "Designed as a fully unisex line, in partnership with creative director Ryan Benson, Martyre reflects a spectrum of embellishment, offering everything from hoop earrings to simple chains. Paralleling the macro-expansion of less tailored, gender-agnostic fashion, Martyre brings a by-young-people, for-young-people spirit to the jewelry market. But Hadid’s interest in the medium predates the trend: “I was raised by my mom and I have four sisters, so I [always] saw [jewelry] from a different perspective,” he says. “My mom would give me her really fancy necklaces and stuff to wear and I would be like, ‘This is so fire. I’m be stunting on all [the guys],’ even if I got made fun of or whatever. I had the cool, fancy necklace, you know?”  \n",
      "Laham traces the line even farther back in time: “In ancient times they would wear jewelry [as a sign of influence], too; It truly is a unisex [thing].” Not just a fashion statement, the line’s baroque iconography (see the cherub studs) relates more to a personal philosophy than a religious one. “There have been artistic martyrs, too—people who have fought for what they’re passionate about,” says Laham. “That’s what we’re speaking to, more than anything: fighting for what you believe in and dreaming big.”  \n",
      "While their personal favorites hew toward simple (Hadid wears the Caleb chain necklace daily, and Laham the Sinner cuff), for an added dose of expressionism, both recommend the Abbey hoops—inspired by an R&B aesthetic but intended for fly-girls and fly-boys of all sorts. “I wear things that I want to wear, regardless of whether the person who makes it tells me it’s for a man or a woman,” says Hadid. “So who are we to tell someone if they can like a big hoop or not?”  \n",

      " The uncommon rap artist recently released his debut album. The uncommon rap artist recently released his debut album. Photography: Doug Inglish Styling: Christian Stroble Text: Owen Meyers From birth, rapper Buddy was looking skywards: He grew up near the Compton Woodley Airport in south Los Angeles, learning to fly as part of its aeronautical museum’s youth initiative—a theme he revisits in 2018’s high-altitude “Hey Up There” video, with the help of some adorable fellow alums. “That [youth] program is still there, [teaching] kids how to fly planes,” he says warmly. “And I think that’s fire.” Despite originating from the birthplace of epoch-defining rappers like Dr. Dre, YG and Kendrick Lamar, Buddy’s music sounds miles away from tough-talking rap. While his state-of-the-nation anthems (“Black”) may echo the message of Compton’s forefathers, they deliver it over breezy hooks as inviting as an Indian summer. “People expect a certain type of vibe from Compton artists, and I’m not like that at all,” says Buddy, explaining that the city’s reputation for “gangster shit” is reductive and outdated. “I’m trying to show the city in a different light,” he adds. Raised by a preacher father, Buddy, born Simmie Sims III, was singing in the choir before hitting middle school, and later starred in musicals like Dreamgirls as a member of L.A.’s Amazing Grace Conservatory. “I’ve been in front of an audience all my life,” he says. Though he’s graduated from local Motown revivals, his infectious showmanship endures: “I’m used to just killing the crowd.” Today the 25-year-old’s entourage resembles a modern-day Motown, including label founder Pharrell Williams, who introduced him to Miley Cyrus, a co-feature on Buddy’s hazy slapper “Smoke Signals.” “She [and I] were working in Miami with Pharrell at the same time,” he says. “She had a bunch of weed [and] I was trying to smoke. We just really got along over the kush.” Now at work on his debut album, Buddy’s thoughts often drift back to his roots, even more since the passing of friend and Compton pillar Nipsey Hussle. After paying tribute to Hussle at his Coachella set, Buddy is continuing to invoke the late rapper’s inspiring example. “Nipsey was just so self-made and independent,” he says. “That’s the vibe I try to send: Anybody can do it.” COAT ERMENEGILDO ZEGNA HOODIE ACNE STUDIOS PANTS STELLA MCCARTNEY ALL JEWELRY HIS OWN   GROOMER MIRA HYDE (THE WALL GROUP), DIGITAL TECHNICIAN MAXFIELD HEGEDUS, PRODUCER JULIAN DAKDOUK, PHOTO ASSISTANT RYAN MORGA, STYLIST ARYEH LAPPIN, LOCATION CACTUS CUBE STUDIO \n",

Their execution by a Bolshevik assassination squad marked the end to a Russian monarchy spanning 300 years. This perilous tale serves as an admonition; one to the \"ultimately fragile structures that can fall apart in an instant,\" reads Linder's press release. The structure in question here, if not apparent by the subtle context clues, is the fashion industry. Once a fixed cultural pillar standing tall and indomitable, it now trembles in pursuit of renovation, of newness. \"Once completely untouchable structures within the industry are crumbling quickly. Nothing comes with a price.\" Millar explores this void in the fashion industry by way of well, fashion. Tapping also into male fragility, Millar embarks unto unchartered territory in displays of femininity: opulent, though subtle. Voluminous fur stoles draped across models' necks, silk scarves tied around waists and glittering jewels studded hats and collars. With his vision of the Linder man changing every season, Millar keeps one theme standard: the balance of masculine sensitivity and expression. In the interview below, Millar touches further upon his vision for the collection and setting Linder's menswear apart from the label's womenswear. Tell me a bit about the inspiration behind Linder Men's Fall Winter 2019? Yeah so the inspiration started with the Romanov family and their execution, so it's obviously a very grim story, but I felt like it was a rich place to find a lot of reference.  Inspiration? Yeah, for sure. And how did you translate that into like the vehicle of clothing, and accessories, and jewelry.  Well I think for me, it was not quite related to their own personal style at all I think, like somewhat, there were some references that I really loved in that way, but I was also able to just kind of fall into this fantasy world of the jewels and the... I guess just kind of the culture in general and digging in there.  Yeah and there’s like a very clear extravagance to it all, like you mentioned the jewels, the fur, how does masculinity and femininity and those topics inform the way that you design for Linder men's, because they are separate entities.  Yeah I mean I think the woman’s wear tends to go a little more masculine a little more like boxy and that type of thing. It’s not that traditional, feminine silhouette and I tend to like to play with the idea of sensitivity with men and their ability to express themselves through clothing and I think I’m always drawn to just that kind of that sweet sensitivity that isn’t alway highlighted in masculinity in general. Right and it’s interesting because I guess the approaches to the womenswear and the menswear, they both kind of expel the norms that you would expect of the genders that they represent respectively. So is it a very conscious decision for you and Sam when designing?  I think Sam and I just naturally allow ourselves to actually just go where our instincts tell us and I don’t think it’s--of course there are cautious choices  and we are directing what we do--but, I think there’s also for us, just whatever we’re curious about we kind aim towards it.  Right, and tackle it. How does the location tie into the collection? Well I think the collection in general was kind of talking about the Romanov family and parallels to where I think fashion is headed. I chose this spot because it felt somewhat opulent it has a certain kind of like faded glamour and we worked on the set design that being something that felt like a place that was gonna be abandoned and so we had things covered up in white fabric and like when you pack up or shutter a house for a season or if you don’t know if you’re gonna come back to it you’re just kind of like preserving what’s there but it’s unknown what’s gonna be left. I read about your interest in set design and all of that. What else informs your approach to clothing design? Well, I think for me I just started taking photos as well so I photographed our look book this season and I don’t know it’s starting to become all one interest and image making is starting to become something I’m really, very interested in and it all ties together and I think in a way it almost feels like I’m creating a little film or story through images, the clothing, the inspirations.  How does molding the vision of the brand work for you? The Linder man?  I think I allow myself to change that every season somewhat there’s like very specific things that I continue to do every season but I think my vision for the Linder man is that balance of kind of a masculine sensitivity and expression, so that’s why I love using color. I love using things that are a little challenging, but it stays also within the realms of menswear I think just very traditional menswear jeans, jean jackets, suit pants, suiting or whatever yeah like I think for me it’s about like within those boundaries expressing yourself. Great, do you have like a campaign in mind for the collection, I know obviously it just came out. I mean I would love to shoot a campaign and like I don’t have one quite in mind. I feel like the lookbook is very like a campaign so I will have to meditate. \n",

      " Actor Charles Melton and his upcoming role in Bad Boys For Life. Actor Charles Melton and his upcoming role in Bad Boys For Life. Photography: Doug Inglish Styling: Christian Stroble Text: Owen Meyers This article appears in the pages of VMAN 42: Turning Point, on newsstands now. Order your copy at shop.vmagazine.com. “It was fun!” says Riverdale hunk Charles Melton of being a point on Ariana Grande’s pansexual love triangle in the “break up with your girlfriend, i’m bored” video. “And very organic. [Grande] is a mega-talent.” Whether facing off with stars or stepping into the shoes of a previously-cast role, the 28-year-old model-actor remains unflappable. The second actor to play prankster jock Reggie, Melton was instantly magnetizing, helping shepherd the character from “recurring” to “regular” after season two. (A shirtless locker room scuffle didn’t hurt.) This summer, he delivered his first leading-man role, in The Sun Is Also A Star opposite Yara Shahidi. Though a bittersweet teen romance at heart, the film tackles genre-bending themes like deportation—an of-the-moment layer that struck a personal chord with Melton. “America is founded on immigrants,” he says plainly. “In the media, we’re only getting information on policies and people getting deported, but we fail to empathize and to see that these are human beings.” The son of a Korean mother, Melton grew up going to the movies and adoring Heath Ledger. “[I loved] the movies that the critics don’t always love,” he says with a laugh. Even so, blockbusters like A Knight’s Tale and The Matrix instilled a love of escapism in Melton, who waxes nostalgic about movie-theater- going, a “lost art,” he says. “It’s like listening to a record player.” Naturally, he gravitated to acting. “There’s an escapism in living in someone’s shoes,” he says. Following his small screen breakthrough, he’ll be in multiplexes everywhere with Bad Boys for Life, a January 2020 update to the ’90s franchise. As a “badass” former DEA agent, Melton did all his own stunts, alongside founding “Bad Boy” Will Smith. After lending his looks to both comic book and action-comedy franchises, Melton still harbors his own acting goal fantasies. Though he has a dream role in mind, he’s keeping schtum. “I don’t wanna jinx it!” he says. Suspicions aside, it seems that Melton’s A-list domination is written in the stars.

      " A smash-hit young-adult book series hits the big screens, launching a future leading man. A smash-hit young-adult book series hits the big screens, launching a future leading man. Photography: Chris Colls Styling: Ilona Hamer Text: Trey Taylor    This feature appears in the pages of VMAN41, our Spring 2019 issue, on newsstands March 1st! Pre-order the issue here.     A semi-known actor being uploaded to insta-celebrity has only happened a handful of times in the history of fandom. It happened to Daniel Radcliffe and Robert Pattinson, Jamie Dornan and Ansel Elgort, and it’s all but guaranteed to happen to Hero Fiennes Tiffin this spring. The golden boy in-waiting plays the romantic lead in After, hitting theaters this April, a parental advisory–pushing YA adaptation being projected as Fifty Shades for the 1D generation. The model-turned-actor’s combo of leading-man looks and Hollywood pedigree (thanks to filmmaker mom Martha Fiennes and actor uncles Ralph and Joseph) is surefire kindling to ignite a bona-fi de star that will only be fueled by After’s rabid teen following and salacious subject matter. But at present, bundled up in a Soho studio, the 21-year-old Londoner is still best known as young Lord Voldemort in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. Like most Hogwarts alum, he has his lucky totems. Dipping into his hoodie, he pulls out his new gold chain and pendant—a miniature chimney sweep he picked up at a local jeweler in Brixton. “I used to wear only one chain that my sister gave me ages ago. I was never huge on jewelry. I just liked having my one chain,” he says in a disarming baritone that betrays his acting-royalty roots and posh Battersea postcode. But wearing a beanie, a black What We Wear hoodie, and black Madewell skinny jeans, he’s anything but posh. Today, the 6’2” Scorpio looks as though he might hop on a Harley and speed away—which he probably could if he had to: “My brother had [a Harley],” he says, referring to Titan Fiennes Tiffin, 23. “I bought a motorbike when I was 16,” he says. “When we were younger [Titan and I] would ride wherever we could get away with it.” A Harley would be an ideal fit for the bad-boy image he portrays in After. The original e-book, uploaded as One Direction fan fiction by then-25-year-old author Anna Todd, would go on to be read one billion times on Wattpad—an online playground for Harlequin yarns. It soon landed Todd a six-figure publishing deal, a spot on the New York Times Best Seller List, and a lucrative option by Paramount. But to the uninitiated, the mega-cult of After often comes as a surprise, as it did for Fiennes Tiffin. “I had never heard of the book before,” he admits. “Hearing how many fans it has and the numbers that it did, I was shocked.”   With After stans increasingly turning their fandom toward Fiennes Tiffin, one question might be: does he him- self feel sexy? “I don’t think you’re allowed to judge yourself on that! I think you should have it in your head that you are, but I don’t think you should say it on record,” he offers. “But I guess ‘sexy’ is a word that can mean different things. I feel like everyone should see themselves as ‘sexy’ in their head, but I don’t think you should ever say it out loud.” Needless to say, he doesn’t have to say it himself. He has plenty of wordsmiths ready to write their own fan fictions about Fiennes Tiffin online. Since the announcement of Fiennes Tiffin’s casting last July, After fans have flooded the web with photos and praise, like one tweet reading, “Ladies, we’re done drunk texting our exes, we only drunk DM hero fiennes tiffin now.” Some have gone so far as to dissect the few paparazzi shots of Fiennes Tiffin, zooming in to his biceps or his V-cut abs. What does he make of all the attention? “What the fans do, the effort they put in, is so great,” he says with diplomacy. “There are definitely elements of it that are overwhelming, and elements of it that are so cool, but you have to take it with a pinch of salt.” It wasn’t the popularity of the book that appealed to Fiennes Tiffin so much as the complexity of his character, Hardin, whom the unsuspecting Tessa (Josephine Langford, sister of Katherine) encounters on her college campus. While he gleaned that Hardin walks the line between mysterious hunk and brutish jerk, he held off on reading the book, which is told entirely from Tessa’s perspective. Instead, to get into Hardin’s particular headspace, Fiennes Tiffin chatted daily, often for hours on end, with author Anna Todd, who was on set and coproduced the film. He’d worked hard to nail a leading-man role; Fiennes Tiffi n can list off the projects he’s been up for but failed to secure: there’s Christopher Nolan’s Dunkirk, The Hate U Give, and Stranger Things’s second season. “I remember watching [them] and thinking, what was the part I auditioned for? And [one character] would start saying the lines from the audition, and I’m like, ‘Oh, I remember!’” he says. “[But] sometimes after a while you think, I must be doing something wrong.” Which is not to say he lacks confi dence. “I’m defi nitely confi dent in myself,” he says. “I’m self-assured, but I wouldn’t think of myself as the most outgoing. I get my confidence through auditioning; even getting one audition builds you up as a person.” But there are at least a few projects in the offing for which no audition will be necessary: he’s already signed on for the planned sequels to After. While Fiennes Tiffin says many fans have yet to approach him IRL, he knows that may soon change. Whether he’s ready for fame is another story. “I don’t know if you can be ready for that kind of stuff,” he says. As for the Fifty Shades comparisons, this master-in-training is unfazed. “Obviously [Fifty Shades] did really well,” he says. “So being compared to that isn’t a bad thing... [But] some scenes won’t be too fun to watch with the ’rents!”   \n",

      " For SS19, Saint Laurent relived Yves’s NYC. Bob Colacello was there the first time around. For SS19, Saint Laurent relived Yves’s NYC. Bob Colacello was there the first time around. Text: Bob Colacello Last June, Anthony Vaccarello’s first menswear showing at Saint Laurent redefined the term “destination.” From the moonlit ferry ride to a spangly waterfront catwalk, to the finale’s Studio 54–like cavalcade of club-ready models, the show transported guests to a New York of another time. It was this New York that Yves Saint Laurent once lit up with his own destination showcase: his Opium fragrance’s U.S.  launch in 1978, which brought his “dream of the Orient” to life for 800 of NYC’s brightest stars, from Cher to Warhol to Factory scribe Bob Colacello aboard a docked junk-ship.  The designer tended to prefer his imagination to real-life travel, making visits to New York scarce. But what unfolded at his Opium afterparty at Studio 54, as told by Colacello, can only be described as a New York minute—from the star-studded spontaneity to the cosmically SS19-esque wardrobe. Samuel Anderson BOB COLACELLO A visit from Yves to New York was a big deal; he made very few appearances. I don’t think he really liked to travel, except to Morocco. His entourage, led by Pierre Bergé, was very protective. Marina Schiano, one of his muses, ran the American business. When he would come, she’d excitedly say, “Yves is coming, Yves is coming,” as he did to promote Opium.  At Studio 54 there was a sort of secret door that led to the basement, which was like the VIP lounge, except it was only a series of storage rooms with cement floors and a couple folding chairs. You could hear people stomping above your head. But there was a security guard who knew who to send down.  At some point that evening, I was in the basement with Truman Capote and a young English boy named Hugo Guinness—of the banking family, not the beer. Also in the room was Halston, who always wore a black cashmere turtleneck and black aberdeen trousers. Everything was black. Sometimes he’d have a very long cashmere scarf sort of falling down over the turtleneck.  Suddenly Yves appeared with Marina Schiano. He was wearing a cream-colored Yves Saint Laurent suit, with a striped shirt and pants that were sort of bell-bottomed.  At the time Saint Laurent was the biggest in Europe and Halston was the biggest in America. It wasn’t just any American and any French designer. Yves was a huge star; he caught the spirit of the times. He was just the number one designer [but] so was Halston. It was like the King of France and the King of England meeting in Normandy.  Halston jumped up and moved towards Yves, and Yves moved towards Halston, and the two of them embraced. They talked a little: “Darling…mon cherie.” But it was more a flurry of kisses and hugs. Truman says to Hugo, as if he was talking to a pupil, “You have just witnessed one of the great moments in the history of fashion.” Then he paused and said, “That is, if you care about the history of fashion.” Then Marina whisked Yves off, and got him the hell out of the basement.   \n",

The fashion collective unveiled its Spring/Summer 2020 menswear lines with contributions from Saul Nash, Mowalola Ogulnesi and Robyn Lynch. Text: Julian Wright Fashion East presented three designers at their Spring/Summer 2020 menswear show. This show and its group of emerging designers were no exception to the collective's trend of pushing boundaries. Sportswear, loungewear and night life were the targeted fashion segments of Saul Nash, Robyn Lynch and Mowalola Ogunlesi, respectively. Nash featured vented windbreakers and deconstructed sports garments, adding creativity to often-neglected activewear. Ogunlesi opted to show skin and play with gender. She utilized stiff, bold fabrics and revealing cuts to blur the lines between feminine and masculine adornment. Focusing in on Lynch, we find a simple collection packing a major punch. The designer used monochromatic mint pastels to create distinctively elevated two-pieced outfits. The garments aren't elaborate: t-shirts tuck into velour shorts and Alan embellishes a cardigan or bib throughout. But it's the designer's combination of color and fabric that makes these outfits feel ready for leisure. Mint green and lilac soothe the soul as these comfortable arrangements flow around the body. Every element of this collection is well-suited for leisure, leaving its wearers feeling lazy but never looking it. \n",

Covering the last 120 years of men's fashion the majority of garments in the exhibit have never been seen on public display. The show titled Invisible Men will present designer garments alongside military, functional, and utilitarian outfits. Drawing exclusively from their personal archive the exhibition will showcase work from the best contemporary designers. It’s been confirmed that pieces from Dior, Vivienne Westwood, and Jeremy Scott will be displayed. Arranged into twelve sections that exhibition will explore various themes. The central theme will examine the “fetishistic appreciation of the working man” and its influence on fashion. Invisible Men will reference the clothing of seafarers, soldiers, athletes, firefighters, road workers, and explorers. Invisible Men will run at the University of Westminster from October 25 to November 24. \n",

Text: Cullen Ormond It’s no surprise that the outerwear brand The Very Warm seeks to keep all who wear their pieces very warm. And their new range of puffer jackets, quilted vests, and longer coats succeed in that mission. The brand has just re-launched in America under the vision of Laurence Chandler, co-founder of Rochambeau. All of the pieces are crafted with sustainable materials and are designed for those who appreciate durable, warm clothing at accessible price points. The pieces are available exclusively at SSENSE. “Joining the team at The Very Warm to bring a new brand identity to life has been the opportunity of a lifetime,” said Laurence Chandler in a press release. “The brand goes beyond outerwear to cultivate a community with purpose.” And now, shoppers have the opportunity to browse the collection. Below are some pieces that everyone should have in their closet as the winter approaches. White Light Quilted Bomber Jacket | $325 The quilted bomber jacket is a must-have for fall. Add some texture by pairing it with a sweatshirt underneath or wear it solo. It also has a detachable logo tag on the back which can be converted into a bracelet. Khaki Quilted Vest | $295 The olive colored vest is also practical for fall as it provides a sense of flexibility with outfit choice. You could wear it at the gym and utilize the hook on the back which is perfect for hanging it in lockers. Grey Quilted Puffer Jacket | $450 Everyone should own a puffer coat for the gym, New York winters, date night or every cold moment in between. A puffer coat can be dressed up or down - depending on the circumstance and never goes out of style making it a must-have staple. This longer black coat isn't long enough to be considered a true trench, but has all the sophistication that comes along with wearing a longer coat. It is fully lined on the interior while the exterior is made of nylon poplin. Black Fly Weight Coach Jacket | $325 If a longer coat isn't what you're in the market for, check out the Black Fly Weight Coach Jacket. It's essentially the same coat, but shorter. However, this coat is crafted out of luxurious taffeta and features elasticized cuffs on the arms. \n",

      " \"The greatest human artist of all time.” \"The greatest human artist of all time.” Text: Valerie Stepanova Kanye West is gearing up to release Jesus is King, his gospel-inspired new album. Though the release kept getting delayed, Kanye assured that he and his team are still working on it. (West stated numerous times in his interviews that the process of finishing the album is very fluid, and they’re working on it until the last possible minute.) As the album missed its scheduled release date on the midnight of October 25, West was still making the final tweaks to the tracks. The rapper has been hosting public listening sessions of the unfinished record around the USA and promoting his soon-to-release project. Besides releasing an IMAX film about the album’s creation, he also invited Beats 1’s Zane Lowe over to his ranch in Cody, Wyoming to talk about the upcoming album and much more. Over the course of a very comprehensive two-hour conversation, West talked about everything from his recent Christian conversion to his pornography addiction, the death of his mother to his mental illness issues and reconnecting with his faith; an honest, unfiltered look into where the artist stands at the moment. Here we have our key takeaways from the discussion: KANYE SAYS HE IS “THE GREATEST HUMAN ARTIST OF ALL TIME” AND “IT'S JUST A FACT” At one point in the conversation, West referred to himself as “undoubtedly the greatest human artist of all time”. He followed this up by saying that his greatness is the reason that people were disappointed with the MAGA hat incident and his continued support for Donald Trump. “It’s not even a question at this point, it’s just a fact,” he said. “For the greatest artist in human existence to put a red hat on was God’s practical joke to all liberals. Like, ‘Nooo, not Kanye!’”  Kanye also continues to claim that one day, he may very well become president of the United States. When asked about his plans to run in 2024, the artist responds: “We’re working on it.” His hope is to become the leader of the free world and finally be able to look in the eyes of all of the non-believer founders and company executives that ever doubted him. HIS PURPOSE NOW IS “TO SPREAD THE GOSPEL” Having been addicted to sex, culture and all things material in the past, Kanye West is now fully recommitted to Christianity and claims he has been “born again”. “Now that I'm in service to Christ, my job is to spread the gospel, to let people know what Jesus has done for me,” he said. Still, much like his support for Donald Trump, which was primarily focused on things like the president’s “dragon energy” rather than his specific policies, West’s commitment to religion seems to be more about ‘Jesus’ in the abstract. “There was a time I was letting you know what high fashion had done for me, I was letting you know what the Hennessey had done for me, but now I’m letting you know what Jesus has done for me, and in that I’m no longer a slave, I’m a son now, a son of God. I’m free,” he said. “The most space that I had to think is when I went to the hospital. One of the things that happened when I went to the hospital is I started reading the Bible and I started writing and copying out Bible verses.” HE HAD A “FULL-ON PORNOGRAPHY ADDICTION” After discovering a copy of Playboy laying around when he was five years old, Kanye started developing a full-on addiction to pornography and sex culture. “It’s affected almost every choice I made for the rest of my life from age five to now, having to kick the habit,” he said. West said that this later turned into a sex addiction, which fed into his ego. After his mom passed away, the addiction fully took over. “Some people drown themselves in drugs, and I drown myself in my addiction: sex.” PREMARITAL SEX WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION FOR THOSE WORKING ON JESUS IS KING West’s religious discovery was at odds with his past views on sex and porn — just last year, he was acting as the creative director for the Pornhub Awards. Nevertheless, while working on Jesus is King he had to set up lifestyle guidelines for people involved in the project. He asked his team to fast during portions of the album’s creation and not to engage in premarital sex. “When people pray together and fast together, the power is increased,” he said. “There were times where I went to people that were working on other projects and said ‘can you just work and focus on this?’ I thought if we could all focus and fast – families who pray together stay together.” ANOTHER ALBUM RELEASE IS TO FOLLOW ON CHRISTMAS Albeit Jesus is King not being out just yet, Kanye West says he’s already got another album planned: Jesus is Born. The Sunday Service-inspired record is scheduled for a Christmas Day release and will be referring to the communal live music events he’s been hosting across the States this year. As for the actual content of the album, that’s still uncertain and up for debate. \n",

Text: Mayzie Hopkins After this week's protests and arrests in London over climate change activism, it seems that the one company listening or at least following examples of others, is Ralph Lauren. The American fashion brand released a standard-looking polo that is actually made up entirely of plastic bottles and in a way that doesn't use any water or harsh chemicals. Earth Polo was introduced as part of celebrating Earth Day alongside the announcement that Ralph Lauren will remove at least 170 million bottles of plastic from the ocean by 2050, mostly through this clothing initiative. Each shirt, which comes in different colors and styles for both men and women, uses about 12 bottles to make. \"Every day we're learning about what's happened with global warming and what's happening all around the world, and our employees and our customers are really feeling that it's time to step up and make a difference,\" David Lauren, the chief innovation officer for the project, told US News. Other ways Ralph Lauren is making changes to adapt to the worsening climate crisis is by appointing a sustainability officer for the brand, and only using 100% sustainably sourced cotton and packaging by 2025.

So when it comes to making a great first impression, everyone should have a signature fragrance to impress, and V is here to help with seven men's and unisex scents to wow. Aramis Eau de Toilette by Estée Lauder  Aramis was first introduced by Estée Lauder in 1964 and since has become one of the most famous fragrances to date, even having it's personal Wikipedia page. Named after a Turkish root known for its aphrodisiac qualities, Aramis was the first prestige men's cologne that was intended to come off as elegant, yet also provocative. Perfumer Bernard Chant created an unusual concoction that blends notes of leather and patchouli with a natural body odor for a naturally sexy smell. Thé Noir 29 by Le Labo An ode to the everyday black tea and the process that surrounds it, Le Labo's Thé Noir 29 is one of those incredibly unique scents where you can't totally put your finger on what it is. A black tea leaf extraction is combined with woodsy bergamot and vetiver that comes off as a rich but subtly leafy floral scent. Gucci Mémoire d'Une Odeur For Gucci's first non-binary perfume, perfumer Alberto Morillas established a new fragrance category of mineral aromatics. With a cocktail of chamomile from 16th and 17th-century Roman gardens and night-blooming jasmine, the fresh green smell transports you to the breeze of a sweltering Italian Summer at first smell. Tempo Eau de Parfum by Diptyque The Tempo fragrance doubles a time machine that transports you back to the swinging '60s where patchouli aromas were all the rage. Tempo draws upon this era with three separate patchouli extracts elevated by notes of violet leaf. Just throw on your bell-bottoms and go-go boots and you're good to go. Hugo Boss The Scent Absolute for Him The Scent Absolute by Hugo Boss is pretty much the perfect fragrance for the Fall as cooler weather creeps in. Intensely spicy to the nose, The Scent includes pungent ginger with a unique blend of African Maninka fruit and licorice-y mondia root. Bleu de Chanel Eau de Parfum Bleu de Chanel is a true fragrance counter classic when it comes to picking an all-purpose scent. Created by Chanel's in-house perfumer Jacques Polge, musky labdanum blends with fresh citrus and notes of sandalwood for a clean but no less bold smell that is sure to garner a few compliments (and sniffs). Byredo Slow Dance Eau de Parfum Byredo's Slow Dance is meant to blur the lines of women's and men's perfume creating a scent that combines traditionally masculine and feminine perfume styles. Both bitter and sweet, Slow Dance has a base of vanilla and patchouli mixed with undernotes of geranium and labdanum for a scent that inspires “a feeling of exhilaration tempered by awkwardness.” Perry Ellis: America First launched in 1996, this fresh Spring-y fragrance is classified as a sporty scent that shifts for practically any occasion. Notes of juicy pineapple and spicy white pepper combine with woodsy birch and amber to leave a scent trail that'll have everyone following you. Calvin Klein Eternity Calvin Klein's Eternity for men is a foolproof timeless fragrance that first debuted in 1990. Since then, the eau de toilette has become a fan-favorite for the ages with hearty green botanical aromas combined with mandarin, geranium, and sage. Tiffany & Love for Him In addition to the Tiffany & Love line of fragrances, Tiffany & Love for Him shares a common ingredient with its sister fragrances of blue sequoia in honor of the house's iconic palette. Under the piney blue sequoia, you'll smell ginger and cardamom with middle notes of juniper and lavender. Ex Nihilo Atlas Fever Shyamala Maisodieu created this fragrance with music on the mind. The rebellious attitude of Rock’n’Roll fuses with sweet notes of Tonka bean and Vanilla for the vibrant accord of complexity that is Atlas Fever.  \n",

      "French ready-to-wear label, The Kooples, is taking the sporty aesthetic of streetwear quite literally in its latest collaboration. The brand’s partnership with the NBA launched in stores and online today. \n",
      "This crossover is a natural fit for The Kooples, which joined the Maus Frères group last May. The multi-label fashion conglomerate also owns the equally sporty, tennis-driven and considerably more preppy label, Lacoste. \n",
      "The Kooples worked with 12 flagship teams on the collection: the Brooklyn Nets, Los Angeles Lakers, Golden State Warriors, New York Knicks, Miami Heat, Boston Celtics, Chicago Bulls, Detroit Pistons, Charlotte Hornets, Houston Rockets, Orlando Magic and Indiana Pacers. The logos of each team appears throughout the collection of basketball-inspired styles. \n",
      "Twice-striped shorts in a loose fit are cinched by a drawstring tie, while a keychain at the waist offers a functional use. Crewneck sweaters are screen-printed with the teams’ logos on the back and elegantly inscribed with the teams’ names on the front. A chic black label on the hip boasts the NBA x The Kooples collaboration. Short sleeve t-shirts round out the collection, with individual team shirts or an all-inclusive tee emblazoned with the logos of the 12 teams across the back. \n",
      "Cotton and neoprene are the discipline fabrics used throughout the clothing line, making the garments both stylish, true-to-form and practical. The color palette is a monochrome white, black and grey across the board. \n",

Last year, the company worked with Supreme on a collection of red and black luggage pieces, and now the collaborators are back with a spooky spiderweb release.

      " The brand known for \"Just Do It\" has softened its suggestions. The brand known for \"Just Do It\" has softened its suggestions. Text: Brooke Kushwaha Nike's signature catchphrases have always been a symbol of self-esteem, bordering on cockiness. The bold font has been a sort of battle-cry for the athletic brand, but recently Nike has focused on the times we feel less than our best. The shoe retailer has recently partnered with activist and mental health advocate Liz Beecroft for its newest version of the Nike Air Max 270. Titled the \"In My Feels,\" the special edition shoe boasts lime green detail—the color of mental health awareness—and a wavy Nike swoosh. The symbolism behind the swoosh allegedly refers to the ups and downs of mental health recovery. The phrase \"In My Feels\" appears on the heel, as well as \"Have a NYC day\" on the tongue, a play on the old slogan \"Have a Nike Day.\" \"There will be good days and there will also be bad days,\" Nike states in new promo for the sneaker. \"But always remember, you don't need to be at your lowest to get help or support.\" While some brands have come under fire for paying lip service to causes in the name of consumerism (most notably during Pride month), Nike has reported that proceeds from the $180 shoe will benefit the American Foundation of Suicide Prevention. As of August 22, the updated Air Max 270 has sold out online. \"1 in 5 Americans live with a mental health condition, but the stigma around mental health still exists,\" Beecroft stated on her design. \"Represented by the color green, Mental Health Awareness means ending the stigma by sharing our experiences, stories, and truths. It's understanding that healing is not linear, that our feelings are valid & we are not alone. It's okay to feel the feels.\" Beecroft also shared on Instagram her intention behind the design. \n",

The retired-terminal-cum-hotel is a stage for both fictional fashion shows and Louis Vuitton Cruise 2020 tonight. Here's all you need to know about the structure. Text: Emma Li Creative Director Nicolas Ghesquière is bringing Louis Vuitton’s international cruise collections back to the United States in the spirit of the fashion house's penchant for travel. The Cruise 2020 Collection, which will be held today at New York City’s John F. Kennedy International Airport’s Trans World Airlines (TWA) Flight Center, marks the brand’s return after Louis Vuitton previously showcased its past cruise collections in Palm Springs, the former New York Stock Exchange, the South Street Seaport, and the Meatpacking District. Finnish-American architect Eero Saarinen designed the TWA terminal, which opened in 1962. Since then, the space has been deemed an architectural icon with its distinctive wing-shaped roof and tubular corridors. In 1994, the Flight Center was declared a New York City landmark and was later recorded in the National Register of Historic Places. Various films were filmed on the location including Steven Spielberg’s “Catch Me If You Can” and Gary Ross’ “Ocean’s 8” stewardess-themed fashion show sequence. Since 2001, the building has been closed. Louis Vuitton will be the first to hold an event at the restored TWA building before it opens next week on May 15 as part of the TWA Hotel. The hotel and new terminal will include retail spaces, bars, restaurants, a rooftop infinity pool, and Jean-Georges Vongerichten’s Paris Café. Tune in to the live runway show tonight at 7pm EST on Louis Vuitton’s website. \n",

Photography: Hana Knizova Styling: Lorena Maza “That’s the one thing about being in this line of work,” Liam Payne says at Soho House in Berlin. “[Even though] I’m in this whole growing period, there are so many different fashion errors that I’ve made over the years that I just can’t escape.” A digital footprint of one’s fashions—both hits and misses—comes with the territory of being an internationally known pop star. It is perhaps what drove Payne to prove himself with the HUGO x Liam Payne capsule collection. Unlike the ambassadorships we often see Payne-like characters taking part in, this one relied heavily on its namesake for his taste and designs. That is not to say, however, that the pieces look extraordinarily different from the rest of HUGO. “As someone who designs clothes, it’s not your job to make sure that your name is everywhere. It’s your job to make sure that the blend between what is you and what is the brand fits so well that people will buy it, not even knowing that it was a piece of my collection,” Payne says. In fact, you’ll only find his name on the inside of the pieces; he’d rather someone who shops HUGO buy the streetwear-inspired clothing regardless of it being his design or not. The 25-year-old Payne was also recently announced as the face of HUGO Bodywear, and shot by Mert and Marcus for the campaign. “You know, we all look at those people on the [packaging] and say, ‘I wish I could be like the guy in the boxers.’ So at least this time, I was going to be the guy in the boxers! That was neat for me.” The success of the first HUGO x Liam Payne collection has confirmed a second collaboration between the two parties. It would seem there’s more than one direction for this particular talent’s career. Hugo X Liam Payne is available now at Hugo Boss. \n",

Released in the iconic NY colors, blue and orange, Adidas Originals pays tribute with a pop exhibit curated by Eric Emanuel featuring works by NYC creatives. Text: Stella Pak Taking the sports out of sportswear, Eric Emanuel’s vision was rooted from New York City’s melting pot. When asked about how he curated the exhibit of images and artwork for the pop up on 158 Mercer, he explains, “When we shot the photos (with Brock Fetch), I was persistent and wanted to shoot the Halal Guys near Rockefeller Center. They were the first I wanted to shoot because they’re a NY staple. People working in their natural environment wearing the shoe is way cooler than some kid walking down the street in Soho. I wanted to capture the essence of New York City through both friends and people who work in the city that resonates with me…” When approaching the space, you’re greeted with a gritty textural scape through a filter of blue and orange. You walk towards the lower level and find the artworks of Tyrrell Winston – 3 worn and flaccid basketballs incased in an aquarium and a heavy collage of found basketballs nets hung on the backdrop. All while a bright light box image of a basketball hoop in an ocean by NY Sunshine is glaring into your periphery. Tyrrell Winston’s artwork is not only a collage of the found objects, but rather a collage and collection of the people’s history and energy behind them. When asked about the inspiration behind his work, Winston says, “Working with ready-made material found on the street, I was sweeping one morning collecting cigarettes and found a basketball net tied to a fence. I took the net, kept it in the studio. Fast-forward 6 months, I was doing another sweep and I overheard a bunch of kids complaining that no one changes basketball nets. It was an ah-ha moment. I can take the old basketball nets; replace them with a new one. It’s an immediate exchange. I don’t take them and come back the next day. I carry a ladder and a tote bag with a bunch of nets. Now I place nets that are not there. It’s equal parts community service and art. The art can’t exist without the community service and community service is the most important part of the art.” With fans such as Virgil Abloh and a recent collaboration with Selfridges, John Margaritis from NY Sunshine is more than your typical multi-hyphenate creative. What started as a fashion statement, NY Sunshine started building out installations to communicate the vibe of surf and basketball. “I was trying to explain it but I don’t like talking about it as much so instead of explaining it to people, I just made it into an image which was a basketball hoop in the ocean and that’s how this whole art design thing took off.” NY Sunshine’s installations have been exhibited during Art Basel, Miami. Last night was an impressive evening of creative minds elevating the low to the high of our abilities and our consciousness through the Rivalry silhouette by Adidas Originals. The Rivalry High OG will be available on Friday, February 8th at select retailers for $110 USD. \n",

      "The last thing the Fall Winter 2019 men's shows did was disappoint. What they did do was serve absolutely outrageous looks—in a good way. A phenomenal way, really. Never before had a menswear season see such a range of creativity walk its runways. From silk draping to rhinestone briefs and all of the animal print imaginable, the shows were ironically and undeniably show-stopping. \n",
      "On our roster of ceiling-shattering innovators are predictable contenders like Sacai, known for its Frankenstein-approach to combining classic garments into avant-garde masterpieces, and Prada, whose runways run rampant with Mrs. Prada's wild imagination and coincidentally, whose FW19 show was inspired by Frankenstein. \n",
      "A few newbies to the round-up include Ludovico de Saint Sernin who, after just a year of establishing his own brand, was named a finalist for the prestigious LVMH Prize, and Loewe, who saw its first men's runway, perfectly embodying creative director Jonathan Anderson's affinity for flirting with feminine silhouettes. Marni's collection is also worthy of mention, who under the helm of Francesco Risso since 2016, has welcomed a playful penchant for mixing prints and patterns. Kriss van Assche's debut at Berluti showed a strong men's collection with very notable pieces including coats of gradient hues and supple leathered hoodies. \n",

      "The collection moves from white to blue with the introduction of the motif. And the blues from that symbol are injected into the following looks.

The electric blue then fades to earth tones as the next phase of GmbH SS20 arrives. Beige, greens, shell pink, and brown mix and mingle in the sportiest section of he show defined by utility pants and versatile outerwear. \n",
      "The show ended in hot pink. The abrupt nature of the progression to fuchsia made it a strong send-off. Throughout all the color phases, even in the sunset pink, superstition's influence was still strongly represented through the patterns, colors, and sunglasses.

Dubbed Modern Artisan Project, a 17-piece collection will be designed by six fashion students and recent graduates from Politecnico di Milano and sponsored by The Prince’s Foundation, the charity that coordinates Charles’s donations.  This collection is a product of a partnership with Yoox Net-a-Porter, an online fashion retail conglomerate. Using their customer data and drawing inspiration from the works of Leonardo da Vinci, the clothing will be manufactured by six students in the traditional arts and skills program at Dumfries House, the historic estate and educational center that The Prince’s Foundation acquired in 2007. “This project, part of a longterm partnership between Yoox Net-a-Porter and The Prince’s Foundation, will help equip a new generation of skilled men and women to fuse traditional craft with digitally-infused creativity – and, importantly, to do so sustainably, following the example of HRH The Prince of Wales who has dedicated the last 40 years to building a more sustainable future,” said Federico Marchetti, chairman and CEO of Yoox Net-a-Porter.  All sales profits will go to The Prince’s Foundation, which helps to support people through the community.

      " Here are some of Heaton's best fashion moments. Here are some of Heaton's best fashion moments. Text: Reshmi Kaur Oberoi       Charlie Heaton, set to star as the speedy high-flying Cannonball in the next installment to Marvel superhero film series, New Mutants. This news comes after he reportedly smuggled cocaine on a flight en route to L.A. back in 2017. After being deported back to his native England, subject to media scrutiny, the family-man cited how the incident not only impacted his view of achieving celebrity status, but his parents’ peace of mind. Since the debacle, in Flaunt Magazine’s fantasy issue, aptly titled, Seasons Change, Heaton said the debacle was “sorted.” This was his first fashion cover for Flaunt Magazine and he was dressed in Fendi S/S ’18. Since then, he went onto shoot season 3 of Stranger Things, was cast for the aforementioned big screen as well as small screen in biopic, Elephant Man. And what’s more? His love life has bloomed in tandem with a foray into fashion- just in time for Spring. Florals for spring? For Heaton, a musician and actor, flowers are groundbreaking at any season. Heaton, 25, was recently photographed in a full-on Dior by Kim Jones getup alongside his beau and Stranger Things co-star, Natalia Dyer, a style icon in her own right. The pair was coordinated- his bouquet printed collar shirt and ivory trousers bloomed against her black-and-White floral crocheted Oscar de la Renta dress. He and Natalia attended the Ferragamo f/w ‘19 show. His understated ensemble- forest green long sleeve high neck knit and navy blue pants had an understated quality that seemed to say he did not need to try and aim for fashion perfection at all times. It was at this time last year during Milan Fashion Week that Heaton was honored as best dressed man by GQ. At the ceremony, he sported a matching maroon windowpane navy blue sports blazer and pant suit layered over a wrinkle-free white collared shirt with red, white, and blue necktie that could double as a baby girl bow hair tie. A steel gray chunky ring on one hand, patent black loafers with gold buckle completed the look that fit into no particular niche. His bangs were side swept across his head. Heaton’s penchant for fashion was evident in his choice of event to officially end the speculation over his high profile romance with Dyer- his on-screen love interest. It was at the 2017 Vogue Fashion Awards that he and Dyer displayed PDA on the red carpet. In keeping with his true to self style, he favored floral even back then with a lotus embroidered lustrous mustard yellow bomber jacket over a monochromatic black top and bottom. For Heaton, it’s evident that fashion and film are intertwined. He accompanied sister, Levi to the Vogue fashion and film soirée back in London this month. In his 3 years in the industry, he’s been on countless number of covers including GQ Mexico and Italia, and most recently, the upcoming issue of V Man. Though the punk rocker professes to still finding his footing when acting, he struggles with the idea that “you’re not in control of anything you do or say.” His coping mechanisms: music and fashion. A family man- a young father who was more concerned with his parents in the aftermath of tabloid-driven drama, his relationship with Dyer is what keeps his angry, young man deposition in check. His co-actor and girlfriend, “understands something that maybe no one else would. You go into high-pressure situations together but you can share those insecurities,” he said. And just like spring’s bounty, this love is what Heaton calls, “really fucking sweet!     \n",

Copenhagen Fashion Week saw an exciting mix of talent and design, as new designers showcased their work along with more established Brands. Text: Paul Madley          At the top of Copenhagen Fashion Week’s to-do list is making the event more sustainable, according to CEO Cecilie Thorsmark. “It’s not an issue that can be solved with a simple flick of the wrist, but I believe that it’s our duty as a leading player in the fashion ecosystem to take a thorough look at how Copenhagen Fashion Week can serve to benefit the fashion industry’s sustainability agenda to the greatest extent possible”   Along with sustainability, another goal is to showcase the best emerging and existent talent. We take a look at the top 5 Men’s runway shows from CFW (Copenhagen Fashion Week).   MFPEN   Mfpen was founded in 2015 by designer and creative director Sigurd Bank. \"Working to reinterpret the traditional notion of Scandinavian menswear through an experimental and playful scope, mfpen seeks to progress the conventional emotions tied to Scandinavian design through the use of irregular shapes and non-conform hues.\"   Mfpen’s Fall/Winter 2019 collection was named “Morgenluft,” the Danish word for “morning breeze”, inspired by the feeling of leaving a club as the sun comes up whiles others begin to leave for work. Referencing clubbers and commuters, Mfpen presented a show that featured casual, relaxed, tailoring with distressed knits, duster coats, denim, dress shirts, and blazers. Suits were worn with t-shirts, models wore converse and baseball caps. The color palette was grey, blue, black and plaid in variations of these tones. Denim with turn-ups were shown along with formal wide leg pants, striped shirts and classic t’s were tucked into pants for some looks. The collection was understated and effortless, and it had a late 80’s/early 90’s vibe.   MARTIN ASBJØRN   Danish designer, Martin Asbjørn founded the menswear brand under the same name in 2014. The aesthetic is luxurious and understated, focusing on craftsmanship, simple details and quality materials. The brand combines the idea of ‘modern tailoring with relaxed leisurewear to create pieces for the everyday wardrobe of the modern man’.   The vibe was slightly preppy with striped polo shirts layered with long sleeve tops in contrast colors. The show featured dungarees with contrast pockets and, corduroy dungarees in pink. Square shouldered jackets had belted waist, casual, hoodies were worn under blazers, while sweatpants and formal pants also featured.   LES DEUX   Les Deux began with an idea of creating a niche in the fashion industry, represented by combining two completely different styles based on a dualistic ap­proach.   For there Fall/Winter 2019 collection Les Deux presented a youthful show that mixed modern tailoring with comfort and elevated sportswear. A key theme was layering, hoodies, plaid blazers jackets and coats were worn other each other. Pants in formal fabrics were cut with casual fit, while pants from sports fabrics were more tailored creating a sense of relaxed luxury. The show featured sharp suits that were informal and in turn felt fresh and current. The color palette for the show was navy, grey, orange, yellow, mustard and hints of red. Most of the models wore beanies or bucket hats.   J.LINDEBERG   J.Lindeberg is a modern lifestyle brand, merging sport and fashion for an active and style-conscious audience. Creative Director Jens Werner is currently redefining the brand’s legacy, bringing it into the future. To a place where the worlds of sport and fashion come together and draw inspiration from one another to create expressive clothing lines where the aesthetics of the brand and thoughtful functionality both take center stage.   The show was a mix of elevated sportswear masculine tailoring and comfort. Lindeberg presented logo heavy sweaters, jackets and coats. Knitwear featured block colors with vintage photos printed on top. Sweatpants were shown with formal pants and casual denim. There was a big enthesis on outerwear with a range of puffer coats, jackets and blazers. Some of the models wore sky mask and balaclavas down the runway. Lindeberg also presented women’s looks that were equally as edge and sporty, models were sneakers and carried red rucksacks.   CFW X BOOZT.COM    For a special event CFW and Boozt.com put on a collective presentation of runway shows and live music. One of the most supring sections of the show came from the ‘Scandi Tropicana’ section. Amidst the fall/winter presentations a selected group of designers showcased a summer wardrobe.   With a major 80’s Miami vibe the designers showed looks of pastel colors, short shorts, windbreakers, glitter accessories, cycle shorts, a pastel camo’ jacket and a loud yellow and black print. One of the strongest looks came from J.Lindeberg with a matching soft pink denim jacket and denim pant. Other ‘Scandi Tropicana’ designers included, Haervaerk, Helist Emil, Newline Halo and MKD Studios.        \n",

Launching Versace Lifestyle (homeware) in the early 90’s the Versace brand is no stranger to expanding its fashion empire. The luxury boxing gloves is the latest high-end product from the Italian fashion house. From Versace’s Barocco Collection, the quilted boxing accessories feature Versace’s signature Barocco print in black and gold. The gloves are crafted from 100% Lamb Leather and are fastened with a hook and loop closure. The accessory is bang on-trend as boxing seems to be one of fashion’s favorite pastimes. Earlier this month Balmain’s, Olivier Rousteing dropped a boxing-themed collaboration with Cara Delevingne and Puma. Naomi Campbell has also shared on Instagram that boxing is a regular part of her workout routine. This also isn’t the first time that high fashion has taken on the sporting arena. Chanel gave us monogram surfboards in the ’90s, Louis Vuttion reworked basketballs, and we can’t forget Jeremy Scott’s mega-successful sneaker collaboration with Adidas.

      "Ballet served as the introduction to the Thom Browne SS20 menswear collection. American Ballet Theatre dancer James Whiteside choreographed and performed the 15-minute, one-man piece at l'École des Beaux-Arts. Dressed in a Thom Browne seersucker tutu, Whiteside mystified audiences from one plié to the next. Elegant and extravagant: the eye-grabbing pre-show mirrored many qualities of the collection and its \"Versailles country club\" inspiration. \n",
      "Sports and masculinity typically go hand-in-hand in one's mind. Browne challenged that male-assigned assumption by fusing athletic garb with aristocratic adornment. Sports jackets, overcoats and tapered trousers are staples of the sports world; this collection didn't neglect that. It just flipped them on their heads. Sports coats were pastel and paired with skirts; some even descended below the waist with panniers. Other jackets incorporated overly puffed sleeves and one laid atop a corset gartered to a skirt. Codpieces featured on most of the more \"traditional\" bottoms. The exposed tricolor crinoline didn't, but it certainly stood out on its own. Many models walked with sports balls (or handbags that looked like them) in hand. These looks were every bit as loud, luxurious and ostentatious as the monarchical garments they mimicked. \n",
      "There was no missing the references Browne chose to utilize. Sports aren't foreign to the Thom Browne brand, but adding an 18th-century flair made them feel foreign to everyone. Thom Browne SS20 was made to challenge the familiar and in turn created something completely unique. \n",

      "American singer and songwriter Gus Dapperton just announced an exclusive partnership with Depop inspired by his music video for his love-inspired bop \"Coax & Botany\", and it's a collaborative call for fashion sustainability. Bridging music and fashion, this collaboration features 37 items from Dapperton's personal closet, each of which holds a certain sentimental value throughout his music career. Across jumpers, button-downs, track jackets, denim, trousers, and corduroys, the rising starlet is using his platform to simultaneously connect with fans and support clothing recycling. \n",
      "\"I like that it's one whole platform where people can purchase the most important clothes to me and support the reusing of clothes,\" Dapperton said of Depop's marketplace. \"This is something I really believe in and it's great to see a brand foster this attitude and way of thinking.\" Each item in the singer-songwriter's personal closet ranges from $20-100, and all of the proceeds will directly benefit the Environmental Defense Fund. With the preservation and protection of the Earth on the forefront of his philanthropic endeavors, Dapperton is utilizing his growing voice in all the right ways. We sat down with the singer to discuss the collection, his personal style, his thoughts on sustainable practices, and more. Read what he had to tell us below. \n",
      "[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXsRRtsEMKA[/embed] \n",
      "The Depop items were inspired by your new video. Tell us about it. What was your inspiration? \n",
      "We were inspired just by what my bedroom would look like if I was the same age as I was then in the early 90s and what I would wear then. It’s just casual baggy fall clothes, just like a flannel and jeans. We wanted to make me look like an alien but still really human, so we went for more of a chill look. A very human look. \n",
      "Each of these items has sentimental value to you—why sell them now? \n",
      "Before I really didn’t have a good opportunity to, but I saw DePop as a really good way to connect with my fans and protect the environment in some way shape or form. I just think they have a really good platform to do so and it’s easier to connect with my fans this way vs any other platform. \n",
      "What role do you see Depop and similar platforms playing in the sustainability of the fashion industry? \n",
      "Yeah, basically the fashion industry has huge negative effects on the environment. Any chance you get to recycle clothes is beneficial. Depop makes a new and easier way to connect with people and gives it an easier and more social way to resell and recycle clothes.   \n",
      "What impact do you think they’ll have on fashion especially in terms of retro fashion? \n",
      "I think that the impact they will have is that more people will thrift clothes because it’s just a newer and more social way to do so. This didn’t exist in the past, so I think it’ll encourage more people to thrift.   \n",
      "Looks like the items are already sold out—can we expect another sale from you in the future? \n",
      "Yes! We’ll be putting up more stuff very soon. Stay on the lookout. \n",
      "How would you describe your personal style? \n",
      "It’s inspired by my childhood; by that I mean how things fit me and how basic and vibrant the colors were. I like to mix and match extremes. Tight and baggy, dim and vibrant. \n",
      "Who are your style icons? \n",
      "David Bowie, John Lydon (Sex Pistols), Billy Idol \n",
      "You’ve chosen to donate proceeds from these sales to the Environmental Defense Fund. How’d you choose them? \n",
      "Just because they choose the most urgent matters to put money towards. They know how to disperse the money most effectively to pressing, urgent matters of the environment. And, just because it’s part of fashion, everyone in fashion should do some part to give back to the environment. \n",
      "What other ways do you try to live a more sustainable life? \n",
      "I don’t eat meat, I compost, recycle, don’t use straws, and generally try to be conscious about my plastic consumption. \n",
      "Your merch store says it’s launching soon, what can we expect? \n",
      "You can expect lots of Polly People merch that we’ll be selling on online and then some older merch that was formerly sold only on tour. We’ll have a few surprise pieces as well, so stay tuned.   \n",

      "For a brief moment in the ’90s, Miami was the unofficial fashion capital of America. It looks like this may happen again. It’s been announced that the next Dior Men's (Kim Jones) runway show will take place in Miami, this December. \n",
      "The British designer has been the creative director of Dior Men’s since March 2018. Jones is on a mission to explore the rich heritage of the French fashion label. “The US was the first place after France where Christian Dior enjoyed success, and I am looking at a project he did in the 1950s in the States as a starting point for Fall,” commented Jones. “I am really looking forward to presenting our first men’s show in the US as the perfect precursor to Art Basel.” \n",
      "The news follows suit of other European houses. In recent seasons Chanel, Versace, Vuitton and Saint Laurent have all shown collections in the US. With Jeremy Scott regularly showing at LA fashion week there's now a shift in American Fashion, New York is no longer the only hub. \n",
      "In the past, Jones has collaborated with Artist Hajime Sorayama, KAWS and Daniel Arsham on a series of projects. It’s possible that another collaboration may happen with the show being so close to Art Basel. Jones is an avid art lover and keen collector.  \n",

These landmark shades, inspired by the ones worn by Grant in the 1959 classic “North by Northwest”, are offered in both an optical and sunglass option. The two options vary in five to six colors, ranging from classic black to teal, including a new custom tortoise acetate called “Grant Tortoise”.

Text: SAMUEL ANDERSON Halloween has always been a thirsty time for humans, but this year, human-on-ghost love went viral. In addition to headline-making ghost polygamy, the season’s trendiest costume may have been that of American Horror Story: Apocalypse’s Michael Langdon, a half-human, half-ghost played by Cody Fern. As Halloween inspiration and an emergent cult icon, Langdon’s appeal seems to stem largely from his distinct look, as the Twitter user @fructosepapi pointed out:   omg did all the gays do the eyeshadow look this Halloween? Ugh Michael Langdon’s IMPACT Langdon's look hinges on flaxen locks, a mysteriously ageless face, nu-goth style, and, perhaps most importantly, burgundy eyeshadow. Luckily, this new take on the classic thirst trap aligns well with current trends across fashion and beauty. From male makeup to the goth wave brought on by the Fall/Winter and Spring/Summer shows, it seems that the spell Fern's Langdon has cast on the culture isn't going anywhere soon.  Halloween is over, but spawn-of-satan-chic has never been more in. So while you may never be the antichrist, here are some key items you’ll need to complete the daytime Langdon look—no goat’s blood included.  \n",

The punk rocker-turned-streaming sensation brings a “stranger” sensibility to sci-fi blockbusters. Photography: Chris Colls Styling: Ilona Hamer Text: Miles Joris-Peyrafitte    This cover story appears in the pages of VMAN41, our Spring 2019 issue, on newsstands March 1st!              The first time I saw Charlie Heaton was in a pile of audition tapes. He had a thick British accent and, if memory serves, a black eye. I was 22 and casting my first film, As You Are, and while I was initially wary of casting a Brit to play a part written to be me or one of my Albany friends, his take on the character of Mark assuaged my suspicions. If there was one thing As You Are succeeded in, it was the cast; the three leads (Charlie, Owen Campbell and Amandla Stenberg) clicked immediately. We’d all met each other at a time in our lives when, like the characters, we needed each other. We were devastated when Charlie had to miss the wrap party (it overlapped with his first day on Stranger Things) but when he left there was no doubt that the friendships we had made were real and lasting. My most recent encounter with Charlie was at the Ace Hotel in New York, as he was preparing for the premiere of Stranger Things’s third season in July, and his upcoming role in The New Mutants. MILES JORIS-PEYRAFITTE: When did I see you last? CHARLIE HEATON: We were shooting Season 3; it must’ve been when I played drums for Faye Webster in September. MJP: That was the first time I got to see you play—right back where we started, too. Do you remember the first time we hung out, at Baby’s All Right [in Brooklyn]? CH: Yeah, how could I forget? You took me to see that really cool band. I wasn’t impressed [laughs]. MJP: I remember looking at your face, like, oh I lost him. Found this great kid and he fuckin’ hates this. Do you have your own drumkit in Atlanta? CH: No, but I bought myself some music stuff last year—a guitar and keyboard. Because when you’re acting, you’re not in control of anything you do or say, so I still want to do music. Not to release an album—I’m literally coming home, emoting a bit, crying into the microphone... So sad! But it’s been nice. [Music] has always been a part of what I do. MJP: You left for Atlanta to shoot Season 1 the day we wrapped As You Are. No one knew what the show was going to be. CH: You wanted to hate it. MJP: I wanted to so badly. I was furious at the show. They wouldn’t let me shave your head. And then I watched the whole season [in a] day and I just couldn’t believe it. I loved it so much. How has the show affected you as a person? CH: It feels like a long time since [has passed] since the first season. The characters have been on a journey, and all of us [as actors] have been on a journey. Sometimes I’ll get extremely nostalgic for the first season; there was innocence in not knowing what it would become... The trajectory of the last three years happened so quick; you don’t have time to think. And when you get a grip of things, you think, yeah I can be in control of my own destiny.   MJP: [That reminds me] of seeing you get out of the car for the As You Are premiere in San Sebastian. In my head, this is literally when Charlie realizes that he’s famous, but he also has food poisoning... But you insisted on [being there]. It seems like you’ve always just gone and done the work. What was going through your head, [when] all of a sudden there were people giving a shit about you.? CH: At first I thought they were screaming “Dali,” but then I realized they were saying “Charlie.” I was really sick [but] you have that duty. It was a new to me, so I [had to keep going]. MJP: It’s kind of a drummer thing—your head is down, you’re keeping the beat, doing the work... Do you feel like your fanbase, which is a lot of young people, all on social media and who have opinions, puts a new responsibility on you? CH: Everything is really instant, in the world we live in now. Nothing is tangible, it’s all quickfire. Social media can feel quite toxic. It can connect us but I worry it’s pulling us more apart. MJP: We’ve almost lost the ability to have the conversation. You’re not allowed to be wrong or make mistakes. CH: No, you’re not. You post something and it’s instantly judged. So, yeah. It feels like a dark world. MJP: When you’re on set, whether it’s Stranger Things or New Mutants, who to look to for guidance? CH: It is the director’s vision, but as an actor I find it hard to walk away from any scene and be like, that was fucking great! Did you see me do that? You always walk away with self-doubt. I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to please myself. The scene [in As You Are] when Mark and Jack kiss, we worked on that for quite a while, struggling in between takes, hands in hair... [Something] didn’t feel right. But it ended up being one of my favorite scenes in the movie. MJP: None of us knew if we had it... I also remember the first time I asked you to do a series. You were so mad. CH: I was more hurt than mad. It was my second day on set. It was like, “Great, Owen.” And then, “Okay, Charlie do that again. Say that line again.” I was like, I can’t act. I’m fucking it up.         MJP: And it was just because we had so little time... Does it make it easier having [girlfriend and co-star] Natalia [Dyer] there [on Stranger Things]? Does having someone there that you trust, not just work-wise, but that’s also like, “You’re my person,” make the process easier? CH: Yeah, because there are times when you do get stressed. So to go home with someone you work with, and say, “I think they hate me...” They’ll say, “No they don’t.” You can break the walls down with your partner. Because we work in the same industry and have had similar trajectories, we’ve gone through it together. Sharing that does bring you closer. They understand something that maybe no one else would. You go into high-pressure situations together but you can share those insecurities or whatever they are. The great, happy times, too... Really fucking sweet!                     \n",

From Pyer Moss’s exploration African-American culture, to the more recent immigration fueled “American Dream” SS20 Collection by Alexander Wang. Now making waves at LMFW, Martine Rose is the latest designer to take the political plunge. And with the tension of the UK’s political climate thickening, the designer of the namesake London-based brand Martine Rose cuts right into it; using her SS20 collection as a utensil. \n",
      "Edgy is a word that already lives in Rose’s design repertoire, and this season it was no different. Maintaining the essence of the brand’s street culture appeal, the brand delivered oversized suiting, western-inspired denim, and biker jackets with exaggerated shoulders. \n",
      "Opening the show with a beige bomber jacket and dad jeans, the nineties'-inspired look is completed with a graphic tee. Martine Rose used the graphic t-shirt to showcase an original caricature criticizing UK politicians. On the shirt stands a clown with caption “Promising Britain”. And if there was any confusion on who the clowns symbolized, Rose made it perfectly clear after the show: “Obviously it’s a comment on the state of our political climate at the moment, the fact that they’re all clowns,” said Rose to High Snobiety.   \n",
      "The politically charged t-shirt set the tone for the rest of the runway: models sported crazy hair-dos, smudged eye shadow and clownish lipstick. \n",

VMAN sits down with Patron of The New founder; Jonathan Pak to discuss the boutiques growing success, it’s high profile clients, and what’s on the horizon for Patron. Photography: Ciara Gomez Styling: Nicole Pagoumian Text: Czar Van Gaal Conceived five years ago by mother-son duo—Jonathan and Lisa Pak—Patron of The New has proven to be more than what meets the eye. Not your typical mom-and-pop (or rather mom-and-son) by any means; the brick-and-mortar front for upscale streetwear made its name disrupting the luxury retail landscape by introducing fashion’s soon-to-be latest and greatest. With a client list ranging from Justin & Hailey Bieber to ATL-born rapper Future, Patron of the New has become the mecca for the high-fashion inclined and the go-to forum for high-end high-rolling. VMAN sits down with the founder of Patron of The New; Jonathan Pak to discuss the boutiques growing success, it’s high profile clients, and what’s on the horizon for Patron. Read the exclusive conversation below! How exactly was Patron of The New born?  We started Patron about 5 years ago. I went to Tulane for my freshman year and then I transferred to Loyola for music business. I ended up dropping out after those two years to start Patron of The New.  It all made perfect sense, I’ve always had a deep appreciation for fashion especially high fashion. I got into high fashion really early, at 17 [I] was on the forums selling and buying designer clothing. Patron of The New just kind of happened when we took something we were passionate about and made it into a business. We opened the store, then found some cool brands and we just went from there. What is the significance behind the name Patron of The New? We are always the first to find cool new brands. We were one of the first to have Mike Amiri, we were one of the first stores to sell Off White. Now we have Dior and we are about to get Givenchy. It’s great to have iconic designers but we also know how to bring up new brands like Eric Emmanuel and brands that people may have not heard of, hence the name Patron of The New. What would you say the key to Patron of The New’s success is? The store is still in its infancy but has already become such an established go-to for Luxury Designer clothing.  Honestly, by just being us. What makes our store is we love our clients. I have built a lot of great relationships with my clients and we have all become good friends. What also make’s Patron is we do things differently than other luxury stores. Especially in the sense of what brands that we bring and introduce to the clientele. We genuinely love what we do here, and it shows from the moment you walk into the store. I am always excited to come in and see what’s new, I even open up boxes myself, I love doing the little tedious task. I just get excited about it all like it’s Christmas every week. So, you are still here on a regular basis involved with the store’s day-to-day? Yeah, I am here a lot. I try to be here as much as I can because when I come in I don’t feel like I am working. It’s all just fun for me. Since we are on the topic of your hands-on approach to business, let’s discuss your partner in bringing Patron of The New to life; your mother (Lisa Pak). She seems to be a major influence not only on you but obviously on the business as well. How has she helped with navigating the world of fashion and business? Does she have a background in either of those realms? My mom actually has an art background. She went to UCLA for art, so she’s an artist. I think that’s where I got a lot of my artistic genes from I guess. (Laughs) She is an artist who's been in the interior design business for years and has now transitioned into fashion. She actually helped Patron of The New take its current form. I originally wanted to start a skate shop because I was a skater back in the day. A lot of the conceptualization for Patron came from her and she designed the store as well. She’s really the one behind the scenes making it happen. It’s a real family business. Oh wow! A family business indeed.  A real mom-and-pop…well, mom-and-son.  Exactly! Patron of The New started off introducing the coolest up and coming luxury brands but now you have found a way to incorporate classic fashion houses like Dior and Givenchy into the store’s line up. How exactly did you go about that? And what other brands are you looking forward to bringing into Patron’s fold?  We just got AMBUSH and Chrome Hearts, just to name a few. There are a lot of new brands in the store that we are just excited about. Brands that if you told me 5 years ago I would have access to, I would just laugh and smile. Just as we do with our clients, our business from a vendor standpoint also stems from building great relationships. Even with iconic brands like Dior, I have a great relationship with the head people over there. So, a friend that works for a brand may reach out to us or we may reach out to them and it takes off from there. Honestly, Its just great to work with people who believe in Patron and recognize what we are doing. Amazing. So earlier you briefly touched on your background in music before venturing off into starting Patron of The New. Are there any plans to get back into that industry being that a lot of your high-profile clientele come from the music industry? Do you plan to integrate these two passions; music and fashion?  I am getting back into the music industry. I am more on the music business side of things where I help out friends here and there with bookings. I have built a lot of great friendships within both industries and that’s why I love Patron because it represents that. For us a lot of the people that come into the store, we are all into the same things. So, we just feed off each other and we grow together essentially. In terms of integrating music and fashion, it’s something we are already doing. We have had in-store events where my friends from the industry preform, and various other music-related events. In terms of the high-profile clientele that Patron brings, can you walk us through how Patron became a fashion haven for them? Like even right now as we speak, rising rapper A. Boogie is walking around shopping and trying on things. He seems very comfortable here, which you don’t see often with celebrities when they shop in public places.  There’s just a vibe at Patron that you can only get when you come here. It’s like we are all family. A. Boogie who is shopping right now, I actually knew him before his first album even came out. The relationship started through one of my first clients who came to the store. He introduced me to A. Boogie and said you have to listen to his music. I took his advice and listened to one of A. Boogies' songs, and I was like “wow! He is going to be huge”.  Since then we have just grown to be great friends and it’s the same with my other clients. Also, Future was one of our first clients and now most of the stuff you see him wearing is from Patron. We have a lot of great clients, whether it’s people in music, art, film, or even athletes. Aside from being high profile, who would you say the Patron of The New client is?  We don’t have a specific client, it’s very spread out. It’s a wide spectrum, basically anyone who has an appreciation for fashion. Being that Patron of The New has established a reputation for introducing up and coming luxury designers, are there any plans for Patron of The New to expand from a luxury retailer to a designer brand?  We haven’t started our own line yet but that is also something we are excited about exploring. In the past we have had collaborations with brands but there isn’t anything specific to Patron of The New out just yet. In the beginning I was against starting our own line but now we have some ideas in the works. What does the future hold for Patron of The New? What are you most looking forward to? I know you have multiple projects coming out but where do you see Patron going?  We are planning to open up another store, I cant share where just yet but it is happening very soon. Also, as I mentioned earlier we have a lot in the works; our own line and various collaborations. There’s just a lot of cool things happening. Aside from that, we don’t look to or think about a year from now or 5 years from now. We just take it day by day because you never know where fashion is going to be in a year from now. At Patron of The New we just go with the moment and have fun with everything that we do. Shop leading designer brands like Dior and Amiri at Patron of The New online or in-store (151 Franklin St, New York, 10013). \n",

      "Dior Men’s latest campaign combines some of fashion’s favorite elements at the moment: animal print, the utility trend, cozy sweaters, and edgy artwork. \n",
      "Kim Jones, who designed the Dior Men FW19 collection, collaborated with Raymond Pettibon, a punk artist with a cult following, for the line. The artist pulled inspiration from Dior’s rich history while putting his own spin on the timeless brand. \n",
      "The collaboration honors not just the label, but Christian Dior himself. The French designer ran a gallery and collected artwork before he founded his namesake luxury label. For the campaign, the garments were photographed in a scene reminiscent of Pettibon’s home state of California during the seventies, a time that witnessed a major underground, punk-rock and street art movement. Pettibon’s artwork serves as a backdrop to the clothes, which also feature his work, while his take on the classic Dior logo makes appearances throughout the collection. \n",
      "Leopard print coats—one made of leather—and plush zebra scarves add a wild element to Pettibon’s flashy artwork. Jackets designed to look like bulletproof vests and black side-release buckles result in an industrial and powerful look. A sweater, which emblazoned with the artist’s unreleased artwork, lends a softer note to the collection. \n",

Text: Zoe Elefterin As February wraps up and the cold persists, brands always keep our best interest at heart, making sure we have some unexpected and iconic moments to look forward to wearing in the warm weather. This time, it’s a collaboration with Valentino and Birkenstock. They made their debut in Paris last month on the Valentino runway, and now they’re available online. The sandals use the classic Birkenstock ‘Arizona’ silhouette for a super chic, high fashion update. Available in two colorways: total black with the Valentino logo on the side, and total red. If you’re not sold yet, Frances McDormand wore one of the women’s version at the Oscars last Sunday and they pretty much blew up online, so V think you should get on board. The black pair retails for $495 and the red for $460. Check them out below. \n",

      " Behold, fashion's new Franken-shoe, the Converse x J.W. Anderson Run Star Hike. Behold, fashion's new Franken-shoe, the Converse x J.W. Anderson Run Star Hike. Text: Brandon Tan Et voila, one of the first sneaker releases of 2019: the Converse x J.W. Anderson Run Star Hike. This merging of two minds, two heritages, American classic and British innovation, has stood the test of time, staying fresh after multiple seasons of banding together. From felt sneakers to toy-inspired kicks, today the two bring unto the world a play on proportion. “Contrasting proportions have always been part of my design aesthetic. When I approached this latest Converse, I was looking to re-create the same aesthetic by pairing the sole of a Run Star with the classic Chuck Taylor to emphasize the proportions,” says Anderson. Somehow harmonious in its odd distribution of size, the shoe serves as a trophy to today's rise in the Frankenstein approach—a mixing of different elements into a single product. That said, the sneaker maintains Converse's integrity, while introducing Anderson's novelty. While at first sight, simple in design, its conception was anything but. Anderson left the sneaker's upper completely untouched, while sourcing inspiration for its sole from a separate Converse shoe, the Run Star. Playing with scale and injecting his personal touch in design, the shoe was birthed as three parts—upper, midsole and outsole. Each part distinct in its own right, they come together as the Run Star Hike. \"Jonathan has been a terrific partner for Converse in extending in the Chuck 70 and forging a connection between youth culture and studied runway fashion,\" says Matt Sleep, Converse Design Director, Special Projects & Collaboration. The shoe saw its first step on the runway of J.W. Anderson's SS19 show, but is set to release in early February. \n",

      "Chinese brand, Peacebird Men, showcased their heavily charcoal-toned Fall/Winter collection at this year’s NYFW. The dark and mainly color void pieces were adorned with multiple metal-chained body bags, studded gloves and an occasional fur baseball cap. Although the muted tones throughout the collection could have been repetitive, Peacebird redeemed themselves in the form of texture and print. \n",
      "The amount of tartan was bold. Its noticeable re-occurring presence gave the collection an addition of depth and acted like charming background noise against the subtler and less vivacious pieces. Models were seen wearing tartan pants, reminiscent of pajamas but thankfully not quite, full tartan body suits complete with gloves, and raised collared shirts sandwiched between multiple layers. As well as the varying textures, such as vinyl in a black, shiny trench coat and a white duvet-like puffer jacket. \n",
      "Peacebird’s fascination with youth culture as its main inspiration may have been the reasoning behind introducing the nonspecific Sesame Street’s character Oscar and Elmo on a T-shirt. It also may have been why nearly all the models were wearing identical black slim sunglasses, or a hat to cover their faces. Not to mention the Made in China statement, a precedent to a new and evolving country. Overall, Peacebird proved why it’s one of the fastest growing fashion brands in China and the potential for it to become one elsewhere too.                  \n",

The watchmaker is releasing a limited edition version of its Speedmaster, the first watch ever on the moon. Text: Julian Wright It's been 50 years since the first man walked on the moon. That means it's also been 50 years since a watch touched lunar surface, too - Omega sure remembers. After all, its Speedmaster has exclusive rights to that achievement, worn by legendary astronaut, Buzz Aldrin. At 03:15 UTC on that day, the Speedmaster made history. Now, Omega plans to celebrate that history with a limited edition, Apollo 11-themed version of their watch. Every detail of the Speedmaster Apollo 11 watch commemorates the moon landing. Even the amount of watches made (6,969, to be exact) is a nod to the year it happened. In the spirit of innovation that sparked the mission's success, Omega has unveiled a new alloy for this watch. Aptly named, 18k Moonshine gold is a patent-pending, paler gold alloy with a higher resistance to fading. This 18k Moonshine gold details the watch, including a tribute to the missions number with a gilded 11 o'clock hour marker. The Buzz Aldrin engraving on the watch's subdial is also made from this special metal. On the watch's caseback, one can find an astronaut footprint and Armstrong's famous words, \"That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.\" Omega created a special watch for a truly special day in history. You can find more details about the Omega Speedmaster Apollo 11 50th Anniversary Limited Edition watch here. \n",

      " \n",
      "Under the helm of a freshly-appointed Kim Jones, the Dior man walked his first Pre-Fall runway last night. The Dior Homme show took place in Tokyo, following in the catwalks of French comrades who’ve shown in Japan, including Valentino who showed its PF19 collection in Tokyo just a few days ago, and Louis Vuitton’s Cruise 2018 show hosted in Kyoto.  \n",
      "“A fashion show in Tokyo is the best way to present and celebrate my first Dior pre-fall men’s show. Japan is a magical country that I know quite well and that I love particularly for its incredible and unique culture, history and nature, which have always been very fascinating and a great source of inspiration to me,\" said Kim Jones in a statement. \n",
      "Not only was Japan tapped by Jones as a location for the show, but also as a clear source for inspiration. Notes of Japanese culture bled throughout, and with so much tradition to draw upon, it seemed Dior Homme had found an entirely new world in which a robot stood front a center. Designed by Japanese illustrator, Hajime Sorayama, a mammoth metal figure held center stage as lights and lasers bounced off its reflective body. An ode to technology—the future not just in media, but now too in fashion. \n",
      "The show opened with a clear note that eloquently set a tone for looks to follow: Modern utilitarianism with absolutely no compromise in style or grandeur. Jones manifested a utopian Silicon Valley, where practicality implies neutral-toned silk cowl necks and tapered cargo pants in place of poly-blend crewnecks and cargo shorts. While looks showed clean and not lazy in their general sensibility, some garments read more streamline than others. Japanese cherry blossoms stamped the runway, but also shirts and jackets, offering a softer perspective to Jones' look into the future.  \n",
      "Still riffing on the themes of function, the accessories ranging harnesses and cross-body bags also adopted iridescent fabrics and polished metals—details most likely carried out by Yoon Ahn, a Japanese designer behind the esteemed streetwear label AMBUSH, but also Dior Homme's jewelry designer by appointment of Kim Jones. Here, the Japanese influence grows two-fold.  \n",
      "Closing the show were flashing lights, reminiscent of a rave, but as the male models walked single-file and poised, more evocative of a silent one.        \n",

      " Lee Daniel's soapy musical drama may follow the unlikely success story of a girl group, but the male cast's path to stardom has just as many twists. Lee Daniel's soapy musical drama may follow the unlikely success story of a girl group, but the male cast's path to stardom has just as many twists. Jordan E. Cooper By day, Jordan E. Cooper writes for Star, Fox’s juicy drama about an ambitious girl group’s rise to fame - a gig he landed after creator Lee Daniels read his unproduced play. Following an intimate reading this past September attended by Naomi Campbell, Lena Waithe, and Trevante Rhodes (to name a few) that play will finally open on March 12 at New York’s Public Theater. In Ain’t No Mo, all black Americans receive a mass email urging them to move to Africa. “[Everyone] has to decide whether or not to get on the plane,” Cooper says. The thought-provoking concept grew out of the fatal police shootings of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling. “I was so shaken, I couldn’t do anything but walk,” says Cooper, a student at Columbia at the time. “I walked all the way from 14th to 165th. I was like, ‘Fuck this shit, we going to Africa.’” If the seeming banality of police brutality inspired a kind of solitary rage in Cooper, the election of Donald Trump jolted him back into writing - not that the events of November 2016 surprised him. “[What] white women felt, America’s hangover, was that black women have felt for the past 450 years: disappointed, sad, threatened, not heard.” But he says the singular hour of Trump did come with a silver lining: “I felt convicted to fight - to let black presence be known, not forgotten, thrown away, or belittled,” he says. For Cooper, the process of writing Ain’t No Mo was cathartic. “I wasn’t writing it for anyone else [but me]” he says. Even so, it ended up in the hands of Daniels, whose work has inspired unprecedented numbers of black and queer viewers - including Cooper. “I remember watching Empire’s premiere in 2014 in my dorm room and thinking, this is so black; ain’t nobody gonna watch this!” says Cooper. Despite the shows success, Cooper never thought he’d one day work alongside Daniels, amplifying historically silenced voices like theirs. “[Lee] being black and gay, and me being black and queer - [he’s] a mentor I never dreamed of having.”Since getting Lee’s call (“He was like. ‘I want [you] to be a part of this; I want this young man to write on Star,’” recalls the young scribe) Cooper’s life has just become kind of heightened reality - just like one of his TV plots. Case in point; the reading of Ain’t No Mo in September at L.A.’s Hudson Theater. “It was insane!” Cooper says of the turnout. “One of the main characters, Peaches, is a flight attendant and drag queen. RuPaul was in the audience, Cackling with laughter. That was a humbling experience for me.” ALEXANDRA ILYASHOV Luke James For Luke James, living in Atlanta, where Star is filmed, is like having five million chaperones - an IRL effect of his character Noah Brook's alcoholism storyline. \"I can't go [anywhere] with a bottle of water, even if it says 'water',\" James says. \"In all honesty, I didn't know what I was getting myself into.\" The decorated music producer got by with a little help from his Uber drivers (\"They all watch the show.\") and now welcomes the surveillance. \"[Fans] see him as a real person, which is dope,\" he says. James is no stranger to living legends: Of producing. Britney Spear's \"Kill the Lights,\" James says, \"That was awesome; I grew up watching her.\" SAMUEL ANDERSON Matthew Noszka Former college baller and car mechanic Matthew Noszka's professional track is a winding one. Before enrolling in a required acting class, the Penn native regarded performing arts warily: \"I remember seeing guys in leotards on campus and thinking, what's going on here?\" But the applause his first-ever monologue elicited changed all that. His knack for Insta-connection has led to everything from a model agent (\"He DM-ed me for shirtless photos. Only later did I realize that's normal.\") to his ever expanding role on Star as Jackson. \"In our first scene together, Jude and I improv-ed this Bonnie and Clyde situation, when she slashes a tire,\" he recalls. \"I feel like they kind of saw a spark there.\" SA Miss Lawrence Hairy stylist-turned-actor has had a courtside seat to the modern LGBTQ revolution. Growing up, his nonconforming looks were \"rarely accepted,\" other than by his earliest clients: girls in high school. After going pro, Lawrence catered to several Atlanta Housewives cast members, and from there the gigs snowballed into a walk-on role on Empire. His role as Miss Bruce on Lee Daniel's Star has mirrored larger cultural shifts: \"Most people look at [stylists] as a 'kiki' and a cackle, but they have [more] to offer,\" he says - as the third season demonstrates in the arc between Miss Bruce and Noah Brooks. \"It's almost nonexistent to see a heterosexual man befriend a black gay man,\" he says. \"I think [the show] will really aid in healing that.\" SA \n",

      "Leading luxury menswear house Ermenegildo Zegna joined forces with beauty giant Estée Lauder for the \"Essenze\" collection, a multidimensional range that takes cues from both the material and immaterial worlds. At the Essenze launch at Milanese design fair Salone del Mobile, guests could visually experience five \"scents\" associated with a certain environment—one for each of the five fragrances: Mediterranean Neroli, Indonesian Oud, Madras Cardamom, Florentine Iris and Italian Bergamot.  \n",
      "Conceived by The Unseen, a fashion studio that works to visualize invisible environmental elements—in this case, scents—the visuals drew from data about each of the geographic inspirations. As metaphysical as the installation was, it's no surprise given Unseen's founder Lauren Bowker's side hobby: witchery. A self-described occultist and alchemist, Bowker's past inventions include climate-sensitive textile dye and color-changing hair.  \n",
      "With Zegna and Estée's mutual reputations for finery with mass appeal, the fragrance collaboration is decidedly more resort than occult. Sourced from precious ingredients like neroli and oud, the colorific range is sure to give any bespoke Zegna silhouette an extra drop of it-factor.    \n",

Abloh draws upon significant pillars of life and development to display the Vuitton he envisions, celebrating purity, diversity and communication. Text: Brandon Tan Fresh off the debut of his second collection for Louis Vuitton, Virgil Abloh released his SS19 campaign today. Put simply, Louis Vuitton's three-chapter campaign can be put into three words: LV for life. Though concise, the project provides a comprehensive understanding of Virgil's Vuitton vision. \"Campaign[s]\", by definition according to the French house's press release, are \"visuals created by a fashion house to publicise its seasonal collection,\" but also \"A verb delineating the act of soliciting support for a cause.\" Here, Abloh combines both meanings to campaign for his beliefs by way of his Spring Summer 2019 collection. The first \"phase\" of Vuitton men's SS19 campaign reads \"1. Infancy, Childhood and Adolescence\", photographed by Inez & Vinoodh. Here, significance lies within the developmental stages that inform a man's being; his \"identity and wardrobe\". Innocence runs rampant, with youth and purity to justify the unfiltered perceptions of gender that we enjoy in these first stages of life. Signature pieces from the collection drape over 2-year-old Jack, 3-year-old Alieyth, 7-year-old Leo James Davis, 12-year-old Evan Rosado and 16-year0old Luke Prael. The second phase of Spring Summer 2019 depicts a familiar image, one borrowed from French realist painter, Gustave Courbet's 1855 painting 'The Painter's Studio'. Courbet's original displays the artist himself working on a piece, surrounded by French people of ranging societal classes. Through Mohamed Bourouissa's lens and Abloh's direction, the designer is photographed fitting a look, while members of his personal and professional life fill the frame, depicting the \"diversity, inclusivity, and unity\" that defines his vision for Louis Vuitton. \"3. School Teens\" reads the campaigns third and final chapter, shot by Raimond Wouda. Undoubtedly a formative phase in anybody's life, Abloh focuses on the \"communication between teenagers in group situations\" that most impacts one's transition from boyhood into adulthood. This in-between stage for many sees conflict between uniformity and individuality. Here, students were photographed across Los Angeles high schools dressed in color-blocked tee shirts to depict the quotidian interaction of identities that happens across the globe. \n",

      "On a quiet Thursday night in Tokyo, over 500 guests came out to celebrate Brooks Brothers’ 40th anniversary in Tokyo with a blowout runway show inside the city’s iconic Meijijingu Gaien national stadium complex. Models carried baseball bats and wore embroidered caps with their herringbone tweed jackets and three-piece suits, styled by Jim Moore.  \n",
      "“I’ve come to Japan four or five times for Brooks Brothers,” explained Zac Posen, Creative Director for the Women’s Collection, post-show. “We looked at when we launched here, in the late ‘70s. The collaboration and setting of the national baseball team was also a fun mood and feeling for the show. The women’s pieces in the show were inspired by a balance of what happened in the late ‘70s and fashion’s idea of the bourgeois woman and French style.” \n",
      "Though the brand has a history of making casual corporate clothes, Brooks Brothers has also collaborated with a list of iconic designers, like Japanese hero Junya Watanabe and the American legend Thom Browne. When it came time to choose a global destination for its 3rd runway show in its 200-year-history, Tokyo made total sense. Brooks Brothers was one of the first American brands to come overseas to Japan in 1979. And to date, there are 83 stores in the country with 25 in Tokyo alone. “Japan embraced this brand 40, years ago,” explained Claudio Del Vecchio, Chairman and CEO of the brand. ‘It’s been a real relationship ever since.” \n",
      "Set to a soundtrack of retro songs ranging from Johnny Cash to Pink Floyd, models wore a mix of American classics. Tweed and corduroy combined with oversized shirting and slim suiting. There was also a Harris Tweed take on Brooks Brothers’ well-known patchwork “Fun Shirt”. A glittering sequin dress floated by across the astroturf with a tailored cape thrown overtop. For the grand finale, a fleet of waiters walked in unison across the field with trays of baseball-shaped cookies, pretzels and champagne. \n",
      "“It’s really about redefining the classics,” adds Posen, of the show. “It’s not about trends. It’s not ever about chasing that. It’s really about how to incorporate these classic pieces and interpret them into your wardrobe. And the personal style aspect comes into play with that. It’s about having your staples.”  \n",

      "While the designers on the Paris Men’s Fashion Week circuit may fluctuate, the presence of tailored suiting will always serve as base for exploration, and this season's suits and ties did not disappoint. Delivering designs you couldn’t have imagined in your wildest oversized-blazer dream, Kris Van Assche of Berluti leaves his PFW Men's counterparts in the dust with an innovative take on classic suiting for Berluti SS20.  \n",
      "The solely-menswear marque of LVMH, formally known as Berluti, is more exuberant than ever. In fact, it’s practically jumping out of their well-manicured seams. Using color and artisanal craft to breathe new life into the brand, Designer Kris Van Assche sends bright orange, yellow, and teal looks down the runway. The oddly refreshing color palette juxtaposed with sophisticated, traditional styles (reminiscent of Eighties' satin lapel prom suits) are furthermore enhanced with the use of ostrich feathers. Fully committed to this newfound landscape of snazzy luxury, Van Assche incorporates an element of cursive writing to complete the collection.   \n",

Photography: Mitch Zachary Styling: ARYEH LAPPIN Text: Brooke Kushwaha Kailand Morris wants to be the next face of fashion, and he’s got a pretty good head start. The son of Stevie Wonder and designer Kai Milland Morris has had a love for fashion since he was 7 years old, and has just come off an internship with Dior. The 17-year-old is now teasing his own original line, with big hopes for the future.  Morris credits his interest in fashion to his upbringing, visiting his mom’s shows at Fashion Week from a young age. Working at Dior, he realized that he had a specific interest in styling.  “Every day was just a whole other experience,” he said. “I honestly have to say, styling some of the models, that was like, “Ok this is legit.” Every day was fun and had its own unique things. Honestly, once time came to style the models and put them in the clothes and see which piece kind of fit them the best, that was like a big highlight for me.” The young designer cites artists such as A$AP Rocky and Pharrell as his style inspirations, giving a specific shoutout to stylist Matthew Henson, who has worked with Rocky on many occasions.  “Henson to me is just up there with the greats,” Morris said. “His style...I got to speak with him when I was in Paris. He’s super cool, super nice. His style is just impeccable. There’s only so many people that I kind of get nervous around but he’s one of them. I was like, “Oh gosh, I’m about to fanboy.” I’m always scrolling through his page looking at his outfits because the way he puts pieces together you would never expect one thing to go with the other, but he just makes it happen.” With several big projects in the works including his own line, Morris takes time to count his blessings. When asked to give advice to those who share his passion for the fashion industry, he reminded them not to short-sell their dreams.  “Honestly, I would say no dream is too big to tackle if you have a passion for it and that determination to go after it,” Morris advised. “Nothing is ever too far of a reach to get. It feels funny. I was at the Kid’s Choice Awards when I was 14, 15 and someone was giving a speech like, ‘No dream is too big!’ and I was like, ‘Ehh, okay,’ but then when it came time to follow my own dreams I realized anything really is possible. Nothing is out of reach for you to get.” Make-up Artist/ Grooming: Angie Parker using Milk Makeup Photo Assistant: Maceo Moreau Fashion Assistant: Sam Knoll \n",

The campaign, which is composed of a series of six solitary figures floating in fragile encasements, explores reality and illusion at once. In an interview with i-D, Green shared that he’s “always been interested in how reality can be shifted or appears differently through alternate points-of-view.”  \n",
      "The campaign was shot by frequent collaborator Dan Tobin Smith, and the set was designed with David Curtis-Ring.

      "Rick Owens is known for doing ‘it’ on his own terms; he’s been disrupting the status quo of men's fashion since 1994. He creates clothes that he wants to wear and shares that vision with an army of hungry cult-like following. This collection was named ‘Tecuatl’ after Owen’s grandmother, and it's a reaction to the political uncertainty between the US and Mexico. \n",
      "The show took place at Paris' Palais de Tokyo and featured artwork by British born artist Thomas Houseago. A sculpture by Houseago was positioned at the center of the runway and clay from his studio was spread across the courtyard. \n",
      "Owens took inspiration from his childhood, with references to his mom and dad, family holidays and his cultural heritage. “To be able to mix modernism and Mexico is the direction I wanted to go toward. I remember my mom and all the sequined outfits, and we translated some of those designs into geometric motifs,” said Owens to WWD. \n",
      "The clothes exhibited Owens' usual design themes: club culture and fetishism, pant legs were wrapped in shoe laces and leather was shown in jackets, coats and blazers. Some coats were presented with oversized exaggerated pockets, tied at the waist. \n",
      "Among the usual black and white staples, Owen showed iridescent pieces, but standout moments came from gold sequins and a white snakeskin suit. \n",
      "He also offered options with pants, from rocker-chic tight and restricted to baggy and wide. Shorts featured along with mesh tops, which added a sporty element. Owens showed boiler suits, some just worn to the waist with a deep V-neck tee. \n",
      "Many pieces featured Aztec-inspired hieroglyphic logos and Owens even debuted a collaboration with Champion. “I remember my cousins wearing Champion tees and shorts when we used to go visit family in Mexico in the seventies,” said Owens. “Here, I’ve turned those sports clothes into togas, loincloths, and briefs.” \n",

      "Les Hommes has long been a regular at Milan Fashion Week Men's. Though a fixture at the Italian exhibition, the brand has its roots in Belgium. Tom Notte and Bart Vandebosch, lead designers and co-founders of Les Hommes, are both native to the country. The two met at the prestigious Royal Academy of Fine Arts and began their partnership after their graduation. Fittingly, Les Hommes SS20 felt as though it was a tribute to its creators' origin story. With references to raves, cycling and their alma mater, this collection was a love letter to the city in which Les Hommes came to be: Antwerp. \n",
      "Superficially, the show was sharp. The clothes are sleek and refined; no excessive use of color or outlandish cuts. The fits are loose, sometimes even baggy, shrouding the body in dark fabric. Collars, belts and blazers keep the men looking sophisticated despite their excessive silhouettes. Geometric reflective glasses accented many looks, feeling suitable for both parties and bike rides. The cycling nods didn't stop there: compression shorts and tight quarter-zip turtlenecks looked ready for a Belgian biking team. The word \"RAVE\" was strapped across garments, acknowledging Antwerp's rich nightlife and rave history. It wasn't a loud, boisterous collection of avant-garde proportions - despite their background, that's not Les Hommes. Les Hommes SS20 was a subtle collection for sophisticated, modern men with historical hints of its designers.  \n",

One of streetwear's founding fathers is the subject of an upcoming, retrospective exhibit at Chicago's Museum of Contemporary Art, and he's celebrating with an exclusive drop of Louis Vuitton menswear accessories. The goods will be available at a pop-up, reports WWD. The collection consists of two carrot-colored bags with macing sunglasses, a monogrammed hat, a chain, belt, and sneakers. There will also be selected pieces from Louis Vuitton's Fall 2019 collection for sale. The pop-up joins other festivities to ring in the exhibit, such as the NikeLab Re-Creation center, also put together by Abloh. The exhibit itself will feature bestselling pieces from Off-White. Chicago is a natural fit for the designer's first museum retrospective; it's where he met collaborator and friend Kanye West, which was the start of Abloh's multi-disciplinary approach to fashion, music, and art. The exhibit on Virgil Abloh opens next week on June 10th and is slated to run until September 22nd. The pop-up will be running from June 8th to July 7th in Chicago's West Loop.

      "There was structure with luxe wool jackets, tailored pants and plenty of layered outerwear. The expectation of formality was refreshingly met with slouchy sweatpants paired with chunky sweaters layered over dress shirts, and a double breasted, slim suit for a bit of an 80’s flair. \n",
      "Norbert Stumpfl, Brioni’s design director had a clear vision for the brand since he was tapped for the role in October. He told WWD, “I wanted to make it less formal, the whole look, with this idea of wearing a luxurious garment but being able to forget about it and get on with life.” \n",
      "There was definitely the sense of quickness, with the styling being a bit more laid-back. There were plenty of french-tucks, and windswept asymmetrical popped-collars. Perhaps the most playful section, ironically, was the eveningwear. Transitioning from a neutral color palette, full of rich browns and greys into a few intriguing but occasional pops of color were exciting. There was a pink velvet jacket layered over a brown bow tie and a brown velvet suit jacket layered over a pink knit shirt. The collection ended with an upscale classic, a full tux topped with a dramatic tailcoat jacket for a serving of Brioni's sartorial elegance.  \n",
