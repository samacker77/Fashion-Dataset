He was in full advanced-luxury mode, to be sure—that shit just looks soft—but a dark trucker and white Air Force 1s don't exactly stand up to his massive Tom Ford collection. Lucky for us, then, that Drake knows how to accessorize. How does a basic fit become Big?

      " Subscribe Now Get the Magazine 1 Year for $15 Folks like Tyler, the Creator and Kristen Stewart are ditching the glitz of luxury timepiece brands for something much more practical (and plastic). Every week for the past seven months, I’ve gathered the best watches the world of celebrity and Hollywood have to offer. You can guess the results: Rolex, Patek Philippe, Omega, and Richard Mille watches, pieces made out of gold or covered in diamonds, watches whose aggregated value would infuriate Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. But over the past month, I’ve noticed something peculiar: the coolest people aren’t wearing those types of timepieces. Instead, I see rubber straps, plastic cases, and price tags that barely break the $20 barrier: I see, unmistakably, Casios. The brand's watches really lounge in the spotlight on the wrists of two celebrities in particular, Tyler, the Creator and Kristen Stewart. And these aren’t just your normal A-list celebs, but folks with a long track record of dressing in ways we dream, in our wildest dreams, of dressing. Tyler and Stewart have gone in opposite directions with their Casios. Tyler wears the MQ24-9B, a classic-looking watch with hands and Arabic numerals. The dial comes in the shade of yellow that other, more expensive watches bloom into after decades of wear. From a distance, the watch might be confused with your garden-variety vintage watch. Tyler, the Creator's Casio MQ24-9B Stewart’s watch is much less bashful about its digital status. The LA11WB-1 comes in Casio’s recognizable round-edge shape with a digital display, and an innertube of electric-blue plastic running around the face of the watch. While Tyler’s watch does the song and dance of a more complicated and expensive piece, Stewart leans fully into the fact she is pairing her expensive wardrobe with a watch that costs less than a Cameo from Washington Wizards player (and veritable Who?) Admiral Schofield. (Tara Swennen, Stewart’s stylist, declined to comment for this article for a very cool reason: the actress bought the watch herself.) There’s something interesting about the way folks like Tyler, Stewart and other famous fans of the brand like John Mayer and Ryan Gosling wear their Casio watches, though. They mix their two-digit price tag watches with expensive designer pieces. In the above photo, Stewart is clearly not above spending money on what she wears, but the Casio is of a piece with her slouchy Rich-Casual look: Thom Browne jackets, faded jeans, Nike Cortez sneakers, and a watch that says, I can make anything cool. And she’s right! And in the context of Hollywood and celebrity, among a sea of Patek and Rolex pieces, the most unexpected watch a person can wear is a $20 one from Casio. Tyler, meanwhile, who helped put Supreme onto a more mainstream audience in the early part of this decade, understands the allure of mixing and matching. He knows how to pair T-shirts so incredibly exclusive they sell out in seconds with a watch Amazon is so eager to send out the company is practically firing up a delivery drone at this very moment. Unlike a lot of celebrities who will dress head-to-toe in a single brand, Tyler screws with the knobs of an outfit until he has something that maintains some modicum of inscrutability. And best of it all: he does it in a watch we can all afford. Stewart and Tyler aren’t the only celebrities who have gravitated towards Casio over the years, either. Earlier in his career, Ryan Gosling often wore a $25 Casio A168W-1. “With its daily alarm, hourly time signal and auto calendar, you’ll never need to worry about missing an appointment again,” the product description reads. It’s a funny watch to wear when the appointments you’re never again worried about missing are things like, “Film Drive,” “Date Night With Eva Mendes,” and, according to Gosling’s Wikipedia, “Gain Widespread Recognition.” John Mayer, too, has long been a fan of Casio’s sub-brand G-Shock. “I love Patek Philippe perpetual calendars only marginally more than I dig the Casio Frogman G-Shock—but for different reasons—and if you’re wearing either, chances are I’ll sidle over to you and start a conversation about it,” Mayer wrote in Hodinkee back in 2012. Having an appreciation for both, Mayer argues, is what being a watch enthusiast is all about. Figures like Bill Gates and Robert Mueller also famously wear Casio watches. These two make a bit more sense: the super-affordable and practical timepieces make a statement about how pragmatic these men are. Sure, Bill Gates could wear any watch in the world—he has enough money to buy the world’s most expensive $31 million timepiece 3,441 times over—but wearing a Casio signals something much more strongly about what he values. (An opposition to the wealth tax, maybe!) What all Casio wearers have in common is the knowledge they don’t need a splashy watch as proof of their wealth, celebrity, and style chops. Cherish this fact, friends, because it means you don’t either. Subscribe now and get a FREE weekender bag and the GQ Style Guide.

      " Subscribe Now Get the Magazine 1 Year for $15 The designer making a name for himself by embellishing vintage garments explains his approach. From legal weed to LeBron, Los Angeles has it all—including a thriving fashion and arts scene. We chat with some of the city’s most stylish tastemakers about how their creative endeavors are shaped by living in SoCal. Don’t call Maurizio Donadi a designer. “I’m very involved with product, but I’m not a designer,” the long-time fashion-industry stalwart says. “I have no intention of being a designer. I’ve always been in the middle—I had business sense and an eye without being obsessed. I’m a studier, an observer, and a manipulator, a hacker.” As a veteran of some of the biggest and most venerated global brands—helping bridge the business and creative arms of names like Armani, Ralph Lauren, Levi’s—he has more than 30 years of experience, studying the ways we interact with clothing. These days, the primary beneficiary of Donadi’s observation and hacking is his company Atelier & Repairs, which takes deadstock, damaged, or otherwise unused garments and repairs and remakes them into one-of-a-kind pieces. Wearing voluminous patchworked army pants and a threadbare chore coat, Donadi has an unmistakably original look—a mix of Paris flea market and American army-surplus shop. This mix of vintage military and European workwear that makes up his own personal uniform has become Atelier & Repair’s baseline aesthetic. While it’s definitely a look, it’s not just a look. In 2015, Donadi felt the need to use his talents to help combat what he saw as an obscene amount of waste in the industry. He could no longer just make more “stuff”—so he’s taken his talents to the shocking amount of overproduced garments in the world. His hand-touched, heirloom-like approach has caught the eyes of men like Bruce Pask of Bergdorf Goodman and rapper Playboi Carti. I spoke with Donadi near his shop in West Hollywood—where a sign out front read: WASTE LESS, REIMAGINE MORE—about his career, Atelier & Repairs, and how he’s built a brand outside of the traditional fashion system that is successful for exactly that reason. GQ: Were you particular about the way you dressed when you were younger? Maurizio Donadi: My own style wasn’t a style. I had pants because I needed a pair of pants. I used to buy vintage because I didn’t have money, not because it was cool or trendy. Later on, I looked back to those years and thought, I had so much fun finding things that cost a dollar or two. I was looking more for things that spoke to me than, say, looking for a black T-shirt or a pair of jeans. There was one store called American Rags in my town, and it was the only vintage shop. I remember the smell very clearly. Your job at Armani was essentially to shop and find cool things to show to the design team. How did you get that job? It sounds like a dream. I was hired for a very specific job, for Emporio Armani in the U.S. I had already been based in the U.S. for 15 years, and I had knowledge of the market. What I think I had was something extremely important: data—knowing what the customer wants, opening shops, hiring people. So I was bringing all that, but the fact that I was Italian and also that I had a certain knowledge of a certain market that Mr. Armani was interested in. It was the beginning of a time when there was a more casual approach to clothing, moving from something that was very formal—still elegant, but more relaxed. So he said, Go around the world and bring research. I had a budget to buy things, and I pretty much had no meetings. It was a dream job. Why did you walk away from these big, fancy jobs to start your own thing? I thought that Levi’s was going to be the company that I’d end my professional life with, but it wasn’t. I loved being at Levi’s because it gave me the strength to do something new. But it was time for me to stop working for other companies and start consulting and doing other projects. Levi’s gave me the strength to move to a new place—Los Angeles—and work on small projects that I can give 100 percent of myself to. So instead of getting into the mechanism of a big company, it’s like being a killer—you go and you do the job. But a killer with an emotional spirit! Why Los Angeles? My wife and I were looking at London, going back to New York, maybe Hong Kong. The weather here is good and I was in Amsterdam for three years, which is basically three years in the rain. The lifestyle is healthier. We loved coming here over the years. And there’s a manufacturing base here. It’s easy to go places—it’s far away from everything but easy to go anywhere, if that makes sense. How did Atelier & Repairs come to be? Well, at first it was this one-of-a-kind and creative project, and then we started to realize it was something that feels good. Beyond being creative, the repurposing of clothing, the restoration of clothing, the upcycling of clothing, makes you think about how much excess there is. I said, Oh shit, there’s so much stuff here. We don’t need another brand. And since then, we have not produced anything. We have transformed — manipulated. We’ve been hacking someone else’s design, and enhancing, changing, reducing, amplifying, all depending on our creative mood. So what was the first thing you made? I basically transformed 200 pairs of cargo pants … Where did you find them? You can call around. Anything you want, you can find. And you have the background to find it. Oh, yeah. I sourced everything myself in the beginning. You ask around: Who’s selling military jackets? There are always a few people. Here or in Northern California or in Nevada, Florida … anywhere! There is stuff everywhere. America and beyond. There is amazing second-hand American clothing in France, in Japan, in Africa! There is so much stuff. The accumulation that our industry has generated is unreal. You can’t measure it. You cannot measure it. [Ed Note: But Donadi can, and does, measure it:] 150 billion pieces produced per year and we have a population of seven billion. That’s about 22 pieces per person per year, and I’d say one-third of the population can only afford one or two. Another secret is the yards of fabrics that are leftover. If you’re looking for half-a-million yards of denim? I could find that in a half-hour — not producing anything! \\ I think of you as part of a new generation — along with Bode, Re/Done, Marine Serre — that are rebelling against the system and making clothing with an artisanal feel. Deep down we wanted to show that you can be relevant, interesting, with an artistic approach, without falling into the calendar of the industry and not falling into this system that’s clearly broken. Like, I may not be able to give you a product in red that’s trendy right now — according to some person — but we can give you green. And with green you will still survive. There’s no such thing as “have to have it,” you know? That’s the power of marketing. Also, today anyone can get something from a luxury designer — that’s not special. To me, something that feels one-of-a-kind, like someone made it with their hands, that’s special. That’s the most important element of Atelier & Repairs. Our job is not to be the biggest company or to dress everybody. It’s to offer an element with which you will feel comfortable. And making one-of-a-kind things, in production, is a nightmare. But the satisfaction of you going to the store and saying, I found this pair of pants and there’s only one made and it’s the one that speaks to me—that, I like. That enhances my personality. There’s an artistic point-of-view, too — an artist rarely paints two of the exact same things. A sculptor doesn’t make two identical sculptures. And with a commitment like that you immediately reduce your commercial potential. I’ll never be a billion-dollar company, but I don’t care. I’d rather be a smaller company but more relevant. You have many programs: custom pieces, ready-to-wear, collaborations with Gap and Dockers. Tell me about your approach to building a multi-tiered business. We’re an ad hoc-racy, which is, in our case, an initiative, a project, a company, that changes according to the moment. So if I see that something isn’t working, I’m not obliged to follow it. Maybe it’s my disruptive nature, because I don’t want to belong. I don’t feel comfortable when I’m obliged to do certain things. I’m small enough to be able to change according to opportunities and emotions. That’s extremely relevant to me. I’m not a prisoner of the system. Many brands are very creative, very innovative but they’re part of that system — seasons, trends, fabrics and colors — but that’s not what I’m all about, for good and bad. Having started in 2015, did you think that sustainability was going to be a big movement in the future? We have abolished the word sustainability at Atelier & Repairs, in favor of responsibility. Let’s work responsibly. Sustainability entails that you’re doing many, many different things perfectly. Instead, we’re starting a process of looking at things responsibly. We think we can solve a lot of our problems that way. What stops companies from doing the right thing is that their system is set. The supply chain alone — it would require change with their suppliers, the factories they work with, the way of purchasing things. Everything. That system was built over decades, and they would have to demolish that and start anew. So what is your process of making a garment — since you don’t “make” anything? We source about twenty items, things, like a white shirt or a Levi’s 501, military cargos, sweatshirts. We’ll get 15 to 20 items that we source. Some of them have cigarette holes. There’s inconsistency in fit, condition, color, and so on. Some are deadstock, they’ve never been worn before. So first you give them a sanitation wash. Then we grade them and sort them — some are so bad we can only use them as fabric while others are nearly perfect. When we have an idea about our inventory, then we start to create “stories.” Like, we have sweatshirts with bad graphics, so we’ll cover them. Or US army jackets, we’ll almost always use Japanese fabrics. Why? Because at one point the two countries were fighting each other. So now we want them to coexist. Each piece of military clothing we make, it’s not meant to be used in combat, [so] we’ll make the camouflage less aggressive, make it for weekends or gardening, not for fighting. What I like about what you do is that it’s such an old tradition. This is what people did before the Industrial Revolution! Repairing has been a natural part of any country’s history. This is an activity that has been minimized in favor of consumption. People ask, why spend three hours mending your socks when you can just buy a new pair? I remember when I was really young, my mother and grandmother repairing socks. That was a normal thing. Of course we live differently now, but I think there are ways to prolong the life of clothes. Don’t buy shit, buy less and maybe spend more. It’s OK to spend more if the item is going to last you 20 years. Instead of buying something that will make you happy right now, buy something that you know will make you happy for the next 10 years. Do you remember when you first knew something had to change with the way you wanted to work in the fashion industry? When I left Benetton in 1992, I thought we had sold everything we could sell and there’s no more growth, that we had reached saturation. And then I had this sense of nausea every time they’d talked about global domination. That was my first eureka moment. What do you want Atelier & Repairs be in five years, or ten years? I want to be in retail and I definitely want to be doing more than just clothing. Everything you can think of — paper, bicycles, houses, electronics. There is so much, so much. We could open, in theory, a department store: a cool, very unique proposition of a department store where you could come and look and purchase things with responsibility and creativity involved. Where you could buy a bicycle made from the parts of ten other bicycles. That’s not going backwards, it’s looking forward. I’m not saying for people to stop shopping, I’m saying to shop responsibly.

      " Subscribe Now Get the Magazine 1 Year for $15 The SKIMS creator hinted that shapewear for men might be in the works. Kim Kardashian West has gotten the American masses to drink magical weight loss tea and the president to free a woman sentenced to life in prison for a non-violent drug offense. But can the ultimate and perhaps original influencer, get men to...wear shapewear? You know, the nylon, flesh-toned tubes known in polite society as “foundational garments” that slim your hips, tuck in your stomach, and perform other feats of sorcery? It may sound like a wonky plotline in an unauthorized reboot of Seinfeld, but it seems as though this dystopian future is not so far off. After overcoming its unfortunate original name—Kimono, which was changed to Skims after a social media fracas over cultural appropriation—Kardashian West’s shapewear brand, which is now named SKIMS, appears to be a success, with many of its collections selling out completely, some allegedly within minutes. But Kardashian West is nothing if not a woman who sees the potential for expansion, and she recently hinted that SKIMS may be working on the holy grail of women’s trends adapted for the men’s market: men’s shapewear. “I have been asked a lot about the men’s question, and I would love to do that, and I hope that we’re working on that soon,” Kardashian West told E! News in an interview last week. “There’s some fun stuff in the works.” The flourishing of men’s fashion has meant in part that men are less ashamed, less frightened, about trying new trends in womenswear. Odell Beckham Jr. wore a Thom Browne skirt to the Met Gala, for example, and our November issue featured a portfolio of men in makeup. But men’s fashion has shifted dramatically from the skinny fit that Hedi Slimane first revolutionized at Dior Homme at the turn of the century (!) towards a much looser, baggier, and even huge silhouette. One of the benefits of this gargantuan, almost sumptuous fit—as any fan of Phoebe Philo-era Celine will tell you—is that it doesn’t require shapewear, or really any attention to underwear at all. In fact, in addition to the upset over the original name of SKIMS, many fashion soothsayers questioned whether the very idea of shapewear remains relevant. (Spanx, the original shapewear giant, has struggled to rebrand as body-positive in the past few years.) But as Kardashian’s corseted Mugler dresses have demonstrated over the past year, shapewear is still very much a necessary part of a woman’s wardrobe. (Many of the super-short dresses on Fashion Nova, for example, or Khloe Kardashian’s airtight Good American jeans, would do well with some shapewear underneath.) SKIMS also looks suspiciously like Kanye West’s early Yeezy collections; it’s possible some of the fans snapping up the stuff are just wearing skin-colored bodysuits under sweatshirts. (Reader...they are.) Nonetheless, aside from a small line of tummy-tucking compression shirts and briefs on the Spanx website, and compression tights made by brands like Under Armour and which are designed to be worn during workouts, the menswear shapewear market is almost nonexistent. And while fashion is getting bigger, slim-cut pants stubbornly remain the standard for many men, from J. Crew to Fashion Nova to Saint Laurent and Zara’s Saint Laurent knockoffs. The default jean right now in hip hop—where the baggy fit was first popularized almost four decades ago—is a super distressed skinny jean. Tunnel fits are a dagger to the heart of anyone who believes that skinny jeans are over—every guy on LeagueFits is wearing skinny jeans. (Except PJ Tucker—God bless this man's Fashion jeans!) There are also a lot of taut silhouettes on celebrities like Billy Porter and Ezra Miller, who often wear womenswear or borrow from its shapes. And it’s certainly not just women who are taking style notes from that movement. All of these outfits are the sort that drive women to reach for shapewear. Not every man has the pin-shaped stems of Kevin Durant or the Louis XIV gams of Billy Porter, but that doesn’t mean that they don’t want to dress like them. The celebrity, as Kardashian West knows, holds more sway over what men actually want to wear than the runway. In other words, the market for men’s shapewear, I will argue until the day I die (or until everyone starts wearing Loewe djellabas only), is there. But the idea that you might wear something to make you look a little trimmer under your shirt might still be too much for male vanity, even if no one can see the garment. (I can already imagine the social media snark this post is going to invite!) Until, like makeup and skirts and nail polish and Tabis, they’re not! Men have largely been immune to the reaches of influencers, or the kind of consumer relationship with a celebrity, whether their fame is dubious or begrudgingly legitimate, that drives them to buy something. But if anyone can get them under the spell of a one-woman all-out Instagram mandate, it’s Kim Kardashian West. Subscribe now and get a FREE weekender bag and the GQ Style Guide.

      " Subscribe Now Get the Magazine 1 Year for $15 Here's how New Balance, Reebok, and Asics distinguished themselves in a very crowded sneaker marketplace. To say that Nike and Adidas are the two biggest sneaker brands on the planet might even be an understatement: they boast recent valuations of approximately $32.4 billion and $16.7 billion, respectively. Perhaps even more importantly, these two giants have led what we now know as sneaker culture, consistently putting out sneakers that get enthusiasts’ mouths watering and wallets opening. Even in 2019, Nike and Adidas have been the among industry’s most consistent sources of fire footwear, with styles like the Nike x Cactus Plant Flea Market VaporMax, Sacai x Nike LDWaffle, and Adidas Yeezy all remaining on the hype charts. But in 2019, three labels that have been playing second fiddle to the Swoosh and the three stripes for decades—New Balance, Asics, and Reebok—managed to take center stage, if only briefly. As such, the sneaker world feels much like the new-look NBA. Parity is back, baby! By focusing on silhouettes from their archives, they’re able to take more shots than Nike and Adidas—and it just so happens that they’ve been hitting their targets more than in years past. Here’s how each of these labels made the most of their releases this year, and why this year stands out as the B-tier’s best in a long time. Notable Collaborations: Aimé Leon Dore, Engineered Garments, Junya Watanabe, No Vacancy Inn, Aries Perhaps no other brand benefitted from the rise of the dad sneaker over the past few years more than New Balance: the brand basically invented them. Its 990 style, in particular, straddles the line between high-fashion staple and regular-dude favorite. (A viral ad for the shoe released earlier this year put the V5 on a white background with the accompanying text “Worn by supermodels in London and dads in Ohio.”) The 990, in its many iterations, from the v2 to the brand new v5, and even the 991—a shoe released in 2001 that’s technically in the 990 lineage—have each had their moment in the sun this year. The 990v2 got a tasteful, upstate New York-inspired color scheme upgrade via downtown label Aimé Leon Dore. The v3 was remixed by roaming DJ/designer crew (and GQ Best New Menswear Designers in America) No Vacancy Inn. And the v5—in addition to collaborations with Japanese labels Beams, Junya Watanabe, and Engineered Garments—became the brand’s latest mass-market hit. In all of these cases, the formula was essentially the same: Take an iconic New Balance style, do it up in some unique colors, add some upgraded materials, and artfully place a beloved designers’ logo on the heel. In the case of the v5, the collaboration wave crested so often, and bearing so many good versions, that sneakerheads seemingly forgot they hated the shoe when it first was announced in April. Whether that’s a testament to the halo effect of collaborations or simply that sneakerheads, despite their love of newness, hate when iconic sneakers get changed is anyone’s guess. New Balance even took the time for a heat check when it brought back a style that few knew existed: the 850. When it first released in 1996, it was actually the first New Balance sneaker not to feature a big “N” on the side. This unique design feature and retro ‘90s look gave the re-release some legs—especially in the wake of the collaborations that came before it. The fact that it dropped simply as a New Balance brand product with no collaboration attached, and still sold out with the quickness, speaks to how on fire NB is at the moment. Notable Collaborations: Pyer Moss, Vetements, Eric Emmanuel, Palace, JJJJound Reebok is technically owned by Adidas, but the companies operate almost entirely separately, with Reebok based in Canton, Massachusetts and Adidas in Germany. (You wouldn’t say that watching Monday Night Football means you’re tuning into a Disney show, right?) And this year, Reebok capitalized on three different fronts—avant-garde collaborations, retro basketball sneakers, and their minimalist favorite lineup of Classics. Reebok has never been a company that’s been afraid to get weird with it (remember, they literally made a shoe that you inflate via the tongue back in the 1980s—and people loved it). In that spirit, Reebok dropped new collaborations with Vetements (a colorful mesh early-aughts running style that came in both metal spike-adorned and non-metal spike-adorned styles) and Pyer Moss, which included out-there silhouettes like the Experiment 4 Fury as well as apparel. The Pyer Moss partnership, in particular, also signified a big step forward for one of the fastest rising stars in fashion—and showed Reebok has its finger on the pulse of young emerging talent. On an even more niche level, one of the brand’s former designers, Nicole McLaughlin, became an Instagram superstar thanks to her upcycled footwear mash-ups. In September, McGlaughlin released a limited-edition collaboration with Reebok of upcycled footwear and apparel, showing that the company understands, even if on a small scale, that the future of fashion cannot exist apart from the future of the planet. You love to see it. But where Reebok really found its sweet spot was with nostalgia. The brand brought back the Reebok Answer V, the shoes Allen Iverson wore in the Philly-hosted 2002 NBA-All Star Game (when Iverson was at the peak of his powers), releasing the iconic kicks in their OG colorways of red/white and black/silver. Reebok also dropped a collaborative version of the style with Eric Emmanuel, streetwear’s reigning mesh short king. Emmanuel’s take on the Answer V was white and pink with gold accents, and it sold out in seconds on his website. Emmanuel was in many ways the perfect choice for this collaboration: he’s a millennial who grew up watching Iverson (even going so far as to tell Complex that he wore a shooting sleeve in his local CYO basketball league), and who’s currently mining ‘90s hoops staples for his own line. Then there’s Reebok Classics—the company’s minimal mid-80s styles that have stood the test of time. Reebok dropped a collaboration with London-based skate label Palace on its Workout Pro Low in solid white and solid red, continuing what’s been a successful multi-year partnership. (The shoes haven’t been red hot on the aftermarket, but that could mean people are, you now, actually wearing them.) But the sneakerhead pick for Reebok’s best of the year was the JJJJound x Reebok Club C 85, a so-simple-you-might-miss-it shoe that highlighted what makes the shoe so iconic while adding just enough branding (JJJJound in place of where the word “Reebok” usually goes on the shoe) to make it a must-have for hypebeasts. JJJJound—aka Justin Saunders—represents peak internet cool guy, having parlayed a pre-Tumblr photo-sharing blog into working for Kanye West. More recently, he’s turned his site into a full-on apparel and accessories label that is also fresh off a collaboration with A.P.C. And thanks in part to the halo of its JJJJound collaboration, the Reebok Club C has become a new cult favorite, dropping in tasteful, mass-market iterations that, at around $80 a pop, are easy to wear and easy to afford. Notable Collaborations: Awake, Kith, GmBH, Vivienne Westwood, Kiko Kostadinov, Sean Wotherspoon For years, Asics collaborated with designers like Ronnie Fieg and retailers like Concepts on bigger, chunkier styles from its ‘90s catalog, like the Gel-Lyte III. That strategy worked well enough, but if anything, Asics may have been on it too early. A decade after Fieg’s first collaboration dropped in 2009, interest in the Gel Lyte III and other lifestyle-leaning Asics seemed to be plateauing. Asics didn’t leave the Gel Lyte III completely behind—it’s re-released its OG Ronnie Fieg collaboration, and teased a forthcoming version with vintage store owner-turned designer Sean Wotherspoon. But last year, the label had a breakthrough that represented a new way forward. It worked with Kiko Kostandinov, a young Bulargia-born designer, on the technical running-inspired Gel-Burz 1. Released in three colorways—neon yellow, gray, and black—the shoe lit the sneaker world on fire. (A pair of the neon green version today will run you $1,750 on StockX.) In 2019, the brand ran even further with this idea: drop sneakers that are true to Asics’ technical running prowess, and drop them in a range of modern colorways and new-wave fabrications to keep excitement up. And, then get every cool, young designer that’s willing to make their own version of it to do just that. The sneaker at the heart of this shift is the Gel Kayano V 360—a shoe that first dropped in 1999, and in its original white, blue, and yellow form looks like something you’d get fitted for at your local running shop. The OG version was met with surprising warmth, and as the year went on, the momentum continued to build. In 2019, it’s been remixed by Kith, Awake, GmbH, and Vivienne Westwood, with the models from Awake—founded by former Supreme brand director Angelo Baque—causing the biggest fuss when they dropped in June. Other styles that exist more in this technical running world are the new Kiko x Asics Gel Korika, Gel Venture 6, and Gel Nimbus 21. But Asics didn’t just rely on collaborations to get these styles popping, instead taking matters into its own hands to keep constant buzz surrounding these styles. That meant going to an old-school sneaker drop hype tactic: packs. By bundling up these sneakers into similar colorways with simultaneous releases, the brand managed to create genuine sneaker moments. There was a Gel Kayano V 360 “Gore-Tex” pack, the “Academic Scholar” pack, the “Midnight Blue” pack, and even the “Japan” pack—all of which consisted of tech-y running shoes in updated, 2019-ready colorways. Ultimately, Asics, New Balance, and Reebok did in 2019 what all great underdogs do to get ahead: use the resources they have in ways the big guys either can’t or don’t want to in order to create special products. They might not be able to out-innovate or outspend Nike and Adidas, but with well-timed retro sneakers and the right collaborators, they proved they can occasionally out-cool the big guns.

      " Subscribe Now Get the Magazine 1 Year for $15 The Superstar, the bowling bag, and more. “A partnership to begin a partnership,” says the press release accompanying the much-anticipated photos of the first “duo” from Prada for Adidas, news of which arrived last week. In other words, Prada reminds us: This is just the beginning. It starts with a shoe, of course—a Prada-produced version of the iconic shell-toe Superstar. (The shoe has been part of the Adidas lexicon since 1969, but is perhaps best known as a part of the de facto uniform for Run-D.M.C. during the ’80s.) The collaboration also includes a Prada bowling bag for Adidas, which is a combination of Adidas’s signature gym bag and a celebrated Prada bag shape first introduced in the Spring 2000 “Sincere Chic” collection, which is considered one of the brand’s most influential. While the bag is a clear merging of the brands’ two worlds, the Superstar is virtually unchanged from its original Adidas design. In fact, Prada describes the shoe as “an impeccable icon...which does not require being re-designed.” (Much like our favorite water bottle!) The difference, of course, is Prada manufacturing: It will be produced in Prada’s Italian factory using Prada full-grain leather, underscoring the brand's early-20th-century origins as a leather-goods brand. (Miuccia Prada launched ready-to-wear clothing in the late ’80s.) Perhaps more tellingly, the shoe echoes Prada’s own penchant for luxurious takes on utilitarian footwear, like hiking boots, Blundstone shoes, and Teva sandals. (This is also just how advanced collabs between luxury brands and brands that typically operate outside the realm of high fashion work: Louis Vuitton took the helm in manufacturing the products from its 2017 collaboration with Supreme, for example.) Prada has largely resisted major brand collaborations in the past, which means anticipation for the pieces is high and quantities will be extremely limited. The shoes and bag will be on sale on December 4 online and in stores, and will come in a limited edition of 700. Subscribe now and get a FREE weekender bag and the GQ Style Guide.

      " Subscribe Now Get the Magazine 1 Year for $15 You crazy for this one, Jay! Welcome to Watches of the Week, where we'll track the rarest, wildest, and most covetable watches spotted on celebrities. Once upon a time, if you wanted to invite someone to an event, you may have uncorked your well of ink and calligraphed yourself an invite that foretold potential guests of the elegant soirée on the docket. That practice has shifted over the years thanks to things like Facebook Events and Evites with lasers shooting across them. Thankfully, the art of the invitation isn’t lost on Jay-Z, who held his Shawn Carter Foundation Gala last weekend. VIP invitations arrived in the form of a package containing a bottle of Ace of Spades champagne and a rose-gold Rolex Cosmograph Daytona with a chocolate dial. The purchase of a watch is usually an intimate and private practice: the process of steeling yourself for a multi-thousand-dollar purchase and finding just the right watch that not only will be worthy of its price tag but might one day belong to your children and your children’s children. All this becomes part of the watch’s story and provenance. But you know what’s way cooler than some long boring story about finding the perfect watch? Getting one as an invite to Jay-Z’s party. Also this week, Romeo Beckham’s $57,000 starter watch and Anthony Davis’s totally unavailable Royal Oak. Simply put: Jay did not have to go this hard [sobbing emoji, sobbing emoji]. Many invitees likely would have been thrilled to receive a lesser watch by way of an invite. If Jay-Z sent me a Swatch, I would insist on being buried with it. But Hov spared no expense, acquiring a veritable fleet of very desirable Rolex Daytonas. The sticker price? $40,000. “Hov is on another level with the invite game,” Swizz Beatz wrote over a picture of the watch on Instagram. Now, by law, Evite must shutter its business. Incontrovertible proof that teenaged children—no matter who their dad is, even if it’s David freaking Beckham—will run in the opposite direction of whatever their father thinks is cool. Beckham senior is a Tudor man, leaning towards simple, classic pieces imbued with the grit of Rolex’s younger-brother brand. Naturally, then, Beckham junior is after the opposite: watches that are sleek, so modern that they may as well be from the future, and highly unorthodox. Naturally, he is after Richard Mille. He’s wearing the brand’s RM-005, which originally came out in 2004 with a $57,000 price tag. That sounds like a lot but this is actually one of Richard Mille’s cheapest watches—a starter piece for the super-rich, if you will. Let’s remember a legend—and no, sorry, Elton, I’m not talking about you, I’m talking about the Rolex Day Date. It’s the first watch to ever have the full date written out, and the one beloved by figures like Dwight D. Eisenhower, Lyndon B. Johnson (earning the watch the nickname “The President”), and, well, Elton John. John’s comes with a very cool icy blue dial. Elton John 2020! This watch is nowhere to be found on Audemars Piguet’s website, but it was to be found on Anthony Davis’s wrist this Saturday night in Los Angeles. The extra-thin standard Royal Oak is already one of the most in-demand watches on the planet, with an annual production that can be counted on two hands. Davis’s is factory-set with rubies and is equipped with the maybe-superfluous but who-cares-because-it’s-so-pretty tourbillon complication. It is made in God-only-knows quantities. On certain nights, Russell Westbrook is welcomed into the Rockets’ Toyota Center by a DJ and red carpet. He is delivering ‘fits worthy of the hoopla, thanks in part to some extraordinary watches. He recently wore a Richard Mille RM-011 made in honor of the Brazilian racer Felipe Massa. Westbrook’s special-edition was released to celebrate the 10th year of Richard Mille and Massa working together and comes with a colorful yellow and blue dial. There is mounting evidence that spending any more than $20 on a watch is a fool’s errand. Two weeks ago, this column covered Tyler the Creator and his $11 Casio MQ24-9B. And this week, on the press tour for Charlie’s Angels that hopefully never ends, Kristen Stewart wore some Very Chill staples: jeans, Nike Cortez sneakers, and a Casio LA11WB-1. The Casio costs $20, comes in a cool octagon shape, and instead of a bezel ostentatiously set with diamonds, there is simply a blue plastic tube running around the face of the watch.

      " Subscribe Now Get the Magazine 1 Year for $15 Designers are doing their best work in coats. Cop wisely and cop often. Last winter, I was in a little bibelot of a town we call Paris, taking a look at The Row’s debut menswear collection. Because it’s so understated, The Row’s clothing really demands examination. The details are so minute, the “twists” on the “classics with a twist” so subtle, that if you’re willing to really spend some time, you’ll be rewarded by a new understanding of this particularly ascetic monastic order of minimalism. My mind was totally blown, for example, by a peacoat with a shawl collar. A totally minor tweak, but the peacoat is one of those unchanging fashion classics that rarely gets tweaked. It’s almost like a pictogram: close your eyes, and you see a navy wool coat that hits at the hip, double-breasted with those giant notch lapels. “This is a jacket,” I thought, “that believes it’s a coat.” What a first-class concept! But this is no chihuahua that believes it’s a Great Dane. It’s got big-dog bite: you could put it over a big bulky sweater and walk around, I don’t know, an outdoor mall all day, or keep warm at a football game, or you could put it over a T-shirt and wear it around Art Basel while you’re in Miami (bon courage to those who dare to venture into the neon city wearing The Row!). As the weather turned colder, or coldish, I noticed that all the best stuff arriving in stores and online had one thing in common: they were coats. Designers are doing some of their strongest work right now in coats. The most important item in menswear right now is a coat—usually giant, though not exclusively. Go to a brunch hotspot or a kinda nice or even really nice bar in a major northeastern city, and you’ll see guys (and women, actually) wearing really nice coats over otherwise dumpy outfits. The effect is fabulous: everyone looks a little royal, a new twist on the “I can afford not to care” thing that dominated the 2010s. If the fleece was the must-have statement outerwear of last season, this season’s must-have has swung in a wildly more formal direction. Welcome to the Golden Age of Coats. Make yourself comfortable—take off your shoes! Just keep your coat on. Of course, coats have been iconic in menswear since time immemorial. But as we move into a new era that merges an appreciation for classic style—for “good taste”—with performative dressing, nothing seems more right than an opulent statement coat over a simple outfit. (While it was Pharrell Williams wearing a dress on the cover of our November issue that drove everyone wild with excitement, the accompanying photo spread was an all-out celebration of this look, with Williams wearing insane coats over jeans with his Chanel loafers.) Raf Simons’s Fall 2019 collection, for example, was almost like an old-school couture show in its declarative offering of a whole slew of coats as if they were entire ensembles—a handful of silhouettes in a range of colorways and formalness, with coats for day and coats for night. Perhaps the most intriguing (and most wearable) style was an ’80s-style, Yves Saint Lauren-y overcoat with giant notch lapels and an I-am-that-bitch-sized shoulder that tied at the waist like a robe. The formal and the informal merged. The coat would look great over a plain gray sweatsuit with loafers. Even the puffer, second only to the sweatshirt in the bible of streetwear upscaling, is getting the drama queen treatment. Totokaelo is stocking Balenciaga’s floor-length fuchsia puffer, which brings a new level of drama to what is generally considered fashion’s most pragmatic outerwear. Finally: a coat that takes you from dog walking to the opera. While a coat that kisses the ground you walk on is ideal, it isn’t the only great coat on the scene this season. Celine, which is quite suit-forward, is also making an art out of covering said suits with coats, like herringbone wool robe silhouettes that fasten with tassels or plain old buttons. Even more elegant is Engineered Garments’ leopard-print coat, which, like some of Cristobal Balenciaga’s famous ladies-who-lunch-and-bid-at-Sotheby’s coats, wraps across the body and fastens at the neck like a cape with sleeves. From far away, it almost looks like a smock—vaguely radical for outerwear. It seems curious that fantastic coats are emerging just as fashion begins to take climate change seriously, and global warming has even negated that seasonal urge to procure huge coats. So a proposition: think of the new golden age of coats as gowns. The purpose isn’t to keep you warm, really. The purpose is to make an entrance, and then remain a presence—at, you know, brunch.

      " Subscribe Now Get the Magazine 1 Year for $15 Nike x MMW Series 003 is built for the great outdoors. Since teaming up with Nike last year, designer Matthew Williams (the man behind the skyrocketing label Alyx) has carved out his own corner within the brand’s massive network of collaborators. His sneakers are maximalist and cutting-edge, and the apparel blends futuristic athleisurewear with high fashion. It's instantly recognizable as Williams' handiwork, the type of clothing that looks just as home on the runway (or Instagram) as on the training field. The latest collection from the two is almost here, and it's every bit as innovative (and plain cool-looking) as we've come to expect. For the “Nike x MMW Series 003” collection, which is slated to drop early next month, the American-born designer sets his sights on the great outdoors. \"For me, being outside is so important,\" says Williams. \"Fresh air and sunlight are proven to be two of the greatest benefits to the health and well-being of humans.\" Building on that notion, there are oversized down parkas, water-repellent jackets, and shorts with built-in leggings. There are even Swoosh-adorned chest rigs (a Williams signature accessory beloved by avant-garde streetwear types) to round out the collection. Each garment was created to withstand the rigors of high-intensity interval training and with the idea of an outdoor workout in mind: think plenty of well-designed pockets and weather-friendly materials. And of course, no hyped Nike collection is complete without a sneaker drop. In this case, it's the Nike x MMW Joyride, a relatively pared-back version of Nike's newest impact-absorbing running shoe. In some ways, the clothing and sneakers that Williams is designing feel to be filling the gap left by virtuoso designer Errolson Hugh. Hugh led Nike's ACG sub-label from 2014 to 2018, in the process taking it to new futuristic heights. (These days, after Hugh's departure, the sub-label skews brighter and more 1990s-inspired than monochromatic clothes from the future.) Nike x MMW is made for working out, yes, but it's also easy to imagine a Williams-designed parka paired with flowy wool trousers. And it's that double dip of fashion and function that makes him such a pitch-perfect fit for the Swoosh’s more fashion-oriented fans.

      " Subscribe Now Get the Magazine 1 Year for $15 Three years after a health scare, Sam Reiss found shoes that sound like a clean bill of health. A week ago I was walking home in my loafers from the movies, the new one where an ostensibly young Robert De Niro walks like an old man. It reminded me of how I walked after my spinal surgery. That was three years ago last Sunday, and when I came out they didn’t think I would walk again. I didn’t know that at the time, though—I just knew that when I walked, it was slow. It was a rough fall. I had broken my ankle a year before and injured the other leg a month earlier, and around the election it began to feel like both were being electrocuted. Active recovery from the first surgery caused a herniated disc in my spine, and passive recovery from a second pushed it out. One Thursday morning, after a week of hell, I woke up unable to feel my legs or walk or go to the bathroom. By lunch my whole lower body was gone, and by mid-afternoon I was being carried in an office chair up York Avenue to an emergency room at Cornell Weill, where I slept that night, and stayed for a few weeks, after getting a spinal microdiscectomy, L2-L3. I wondered how Pesci was doing. I had forgotten my headphones and was listening for the 100th time to my heels hitting the pavement down the same route from the movie theater by me, past the rich-people grocery store, my mail place, the bodega. All this year I’ve worn loafers, and every day I hear them when I go somewhere, and when I head home. Sometimes they sound like the execution scene from Paths of Glory, when the soldiers walk to face the firing squad. Sometimes it’s heels in a boardroom, or oxfords in a courtroom—scenes from other movies I must not be able to remember. Sometimes it sounds like the rain. Any of them might be my favorite. I listen to one tap, then another, and am home. My conversion to church shoes began in January, after the Celine Fall 19 (men’s) show, where the models’ black tassel loafers looked very good with their white socks. A long-held, bubbling interest in officious footwear boiled into a split-second decision that I needed them, that sort of universal decisive moment that creates both the best and worst stylistic flourishes. I did some research. The models were wearing Luco loafers, black, which also looked like welt-sole Loake Brightons, released around 2015 in England. Loake makes shoes for the Queen of England, and the collection’s debt to Paul Weller demanded British soling. They’re tough shoes to find, not vintage enough to be archived, but old enough to be mostly sold out. I’m pretty good at this; I figured I could find them no problem. Not long after, I tracked down a guy in Long Island City with two pairs and bought one—and wore them, and kept wearing them. This is like anything else, I thought: Find something difficult, solve a puzzle, play by the rules, find a deal, find a story. I bought more after, Loakes and others, from other people. They stuck, but I wasn’t sure why. Hard-bottom shoes are the only formal tic in my decidedly nonchalant sense of dress. The oxford shirts and sweaters I could pair them with collect dust, passed over for decades-old T-shirts and fraternity jerseys that are slovenly faded but conservatively cut. I would probably make more sense in sneakers. I have plenty and like how some look. They just don’t sound like my loafers. They don’t sound like anything. It’s not just the sound, though. Nice shoes feel different, respectful, quiet, a more direct way of facing the world. I wore black Red Wing Postmans with white socks to a wedding five years ago, but never anything more than necessary elsewhere. But after starting to try, I liked it, and how they look. Led by my feet, my wardrobe has gotten distilled to a more deliberate version of itself, if just as informal. Loafers are versatile, both forgiving informality, and complementing effort. What else do they go with? There is a lot more to choose from. The day after my surgery I thought, “Boy, that was close.” The further I get from it, I wonder if it was. I think about it less. It’s not accurate to say I almost died, but it feels like that sometimes. I learned months later that my surgeons said if I arrived a day later, I’d have left in a wheelchair. It’s hard to get around that difference. After hearing that, I thought, “Crazy, my legs work,” whenever I looked at them. I couldn’t help it. Every time I glanced down for two years the thought would spring up. It’s nice to walk to the store, but exhausting to feel what that means every time you look down. Better to hear it. I didn’t pick up on De Niro’s walking slow the first time I saw The Irishman, but on my second go I wondered how the old young man looked to everyone else. There’s  a bodega on my route to the theater with tables outside and stairs next door. When I got back from the hospital I’d climb them with my walker after a walk around the block. The walk took half an hour. The staircase took five minutes but felt longer. Sometimes people sitting at the tables there would look up, hearing my walker tap up the stairs. I hated that sound. That bodega is the better one, but I don’t go there anymore. This fall the pain stopped, and my legs got better, not as tired, and those thoughts went away. In July the trainer I’d started working out with, this strong guy with excellent posture I met through my chiropractor, told me I couldn’t wear the Margiela sock racers I had on to work out in, just the Polo canvas sneakers I have instead. It’s not crazy for legs to work if you work them. Lately they are the only sneakers I wear. I am dreading the winter and looking down at boots and not loafers. My oxblood Loakes, a second pair with a finer sole, are louder than the black ones, but can I get them wet? I like them. I have Pradas I found for cheap enough to ruin in the snow. Maybe I’ll do that. I no longer think how close it all was, or anything, really. All it was is what happened to me. I just need that sound. It reminds me of what I have. The sound of my legs working is a steady rhythm, one tap and another. Once in a while, the less often the better, I think about it all when I hear the clicks. It always sounds nice to me to go somewhere. Subscribe now and get a FREE weekender bag and the GQ Style Guide.

      " Subscribe Now Get the Magazine 1 Year for $15 But for a limited time only! Earlier this fall, images began circulating of a steel Prada water bottle, beamed onto social media from jolly old England. Nothing could be more—dare we say—decadently sustainable than the logo of one of the ultimate names in luxury emblazoned on a steel, screw-top water bottle. And yet, at the time, it appeared that the bottle was available exclusively at British department Selfridge’s, in a camp-themed pop-up. (That’s camp as in pitching a tent, eating canned hot dogs, and getting to know nature; not entering a room on golden sedan chair and cartwheeling into five costume changes.) It sold out online almost immediately. Once again, America got the short end of the global luxury stick, or something. Now, however, this deplorable Anglo bias has been made right with the release of Prada Escape, a limited-edition “special project,” as the brand calls it, that celebrates the great outdoors. There is an impressive assortment of camping-friendly stuff, including a selection of clothes and gear like a backpack, fanny packs, and a compass (for those who haven’t yet realized that all roads lead to Prada, perhaps?). And then, of course, there is the big event: the Prada water bottle, in a 350 ml size for $75, and, for those who are truly thirsty, a 500 ml size for $85. The Italian brand also makes some of the best luxury hiking boots on the scene, meaning you can actually camp in a complete Prada kit. Prada Escape is available from November 21-December 15 at the Prada Broadway Epicenter, in downtown Manhattan, and from November 27-December 15 at Prada Design District in Miami, meaning you can cop your water bottle and either slide down the Rem Koolhaas slide like a true adventurer, or use it to brave the jungle that is Miami Art Basel. As one Twitter user lamented back in September, “im so thirsty but i dont own the prada water bottle so what am i even supposed to drink.” Now, she will finally achieve the hydration she seeks—if she’s quick, of course.

      " Subscribe Now Get the Magazine 1 Year for $15 Gordon Sondland knows it takes a good watch—or at least an expensive one—to join Trump’s inner circle. As he has with almost all our other norms and institutions, Donald Trump has thoroughly warped what we expect our leaders to wear. Since the apocryphal story of John F. Kennedy riding his good looks, New England country club hair, and bronzed face to the White House in the ‘60s, politicos have been maniacally attentive to what they wear and the signals their attire sends. Trump’s ill-fitting suits, orange skin, and knee-scraping ties suggested he was ignoring all those rules—and barreled into the White House regardless. And as Trump’s band of cronies followed him into positions of power, they proved over and over again that they have more money than style. Who can forget Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich-leather jacket? Or Michael Cohen’s closet full of suits from the Italian luxury brand Isaia, and its signature pink coral pin, that made a wordless claim to his wealth and status? No one leaned further into the idea of clothes-as-costume than Roger Stone, whose devotion to tailoring signaled some respect for decorum—while he coordinated the disruption of fair democratic process with Wikileaks. Gordon Sondland may have been out of his depth as a diplomat, but he is a man of exactly this ilk. He made his fortune with a hotel empire and donated $1 million to Trump’s inauguration committee in 2017, a year later gleefully accepting an ambassadorship to the European Union. And when he showed up to testify in front of Congress yesterday, he looked like a Trump ally—thanks chiefly to a $55,300 18-carat white gold watch from the brand Breguet. Sondland's Breguet Marine Chronograph Under Trump, many congressional hearings have served as the stage for a kind of super-charged fashion kabuki theater. In an effort to emanate the dutiful image of a lifelong civil servant, Robert Mueller made a regular uniform out of D.C. camouflage: boring suits and white button-up shirts. His standard watch? A $50 Casio DW-290 sport watch that tells me he definitely acquired all the Boy Scout badges. When Joseph Maguire, the Acting Director of National Intelligence, testified in the whistleblower complaint back in September, he wore a beat-up $91 Seiko. But it’s not just Trump’s natural enemies who are nimbly playing this game. On Capitol Hill, almost everyone’s wardrobe is carefully considered. Yesterday, Michael Turner, a Republican from Ohio and one of the few from Trump’s party questioning his motives, wore a watch from Shinola, which assembles its watches in Detroit and noisily wraps itself in all the grit and Made-in-Americanness that implies. The watch signals that—darn-tootin’!—the representative from Ohio supports American manufacturing. All this creates a certain set of expectations for government wristwear: lifelong civil servants wear a certain kind of watch, one that effectively symbolizes their substance-over-flash approach to governing, or that puts their love for America on their sleeve. This has been the standard for a few decades: George W. Bush and Bill Cliton wore cheap Timex watches, Obama a $200 timepiece from the brand Jorg Gray. Trump, naturally, is often seen wearing a… Rolex (famously the brand of choice for Ronald Reagan, too). So when Sondland appeared in front of Congress flaunting a watch commensurate with his fortune, it was not unlike appearing in a jersey announcing what team he played for. And until at least a few weeks ago, we definitely knew which side he was on. In early October, Trump called Sondland a “really good man” and “great American” and said the ambassador would confirm there was no quid pro quo. Of course, Sondland’s explosive testimony explicitly said the opposite. “Was there a quid pro quo,” he asked rhetorically. “The answer is yes.” It was a great bit of friendly fire between two men who have relished their roles as successful businessmen and collected all the loudest symbols of that prosperity. Which makes it particularly ironic that, in the end, Trump was stabbed in the back by the arm he never saw coming: the one wearing a $55,000 watch.

      " Subscribe Now Get the Magazine 1 Year for $15 Gucci and Jacquemus tweak a few beloved silhouettes. When it comes to the cold, wet weather of winter, two stylishly functional boots jump out for standing the test of time. We’re talking about the all-weather Blundstone from Tasmania and the quintessentially northeastern “duck” boot from L.L. Bean. (It’s no coincidence that both the Blundstone and the Bean boot have earned GQ’s “Best Stuff” label in recent years.) Now, in what has become a trend of sorts in high-end fashion—designers referencing hardwearing, everyday style—Gucci and Jacquemus have taken these two distinct boot styles and given each a designer spin. First up, from Gucci and designer Alessandro Michele, comes a classic Chelsea-style boot that has been decked out with durable and ultra-tough details—much like a classic Blundstone. Whereas a typical Chelsea boot skews dressy and polished, this design incorporates a chunky rubber lug sole and other outdoorsy features. While you might not want to trek through a muddy field in these, the boot certainly looks the part. It comes in an all-black color (sans the bright red Gucci logo on the back, of course) and in a funkier brown-and-tan option. The second wet-weather boot to get the high-end upgrade is the “duck\" boot by Simon Porte Jacquemus and his eponymous label. Dubbed the “Les Meuniers Hautes” boot, it is a tonal grained leather boot with a raised rubber trim and shiny silver hardware. (If the sleek monochromatic look didn’t already scream luxury boot, then the chic French name certainly does.) There is also a padded collar at the top of the ankle that is reminiscent of another iconic Timberland cold-weather boot loved by rappers and longshoremen alike. Jacquemus even offers the style in a wheat-colored leather, so the slight design nod to a six-inch Timb is likely no accident. For a few seasons now, designer remixes have been giving classic workwear styles a luxurious stamp of approval. (The fact that the fashion-obsessed are wearing everyday workwear is a driving force here, too. Designers aren’t pulling these references out of thin air!) Sure, you could just pick up the O.G. version of either boot, but if you’re looking for something with more advanced-level style, then Gucci and Jacquemus have got you—and your toes—covered this winter.

      " Subscribe Now Get the Magazine 1 Year for $15 A tribute to a man of many hats. Thank God for Carmelo Anthony. While exciting, the first weeks of the NBA season lacked a certain measure of the fun, panache, and swaggering confidence it takes to follow one 17-footer that clanged off the rim with yet another fadeaway midranger. But Melo and his to-hell-with-analytics shot chart made his return to the association last night as a member—a starter!—of the Portland Trailblazers in a loss to the New Orleans Pelicans. And most importantly, Melo’s comeback also means a comeback for nex-level headgear. Melo wears many hats: basketball player, entrepreneur, fashion designer, tech investor. He also...wears many hats: berets, pork pies, beanies, buckets, trappers, and top hats. The current season of the NBA may boast the emergence of MVP-candidate Luka Doncic and James Harden averaging almost 40 points a game, but who else can we count on to deliver stunning hats on a night to night basis other than “Sweet Melon” (a real nickname for him listed on Basketball Reference)? In his NBA return, Melo reached for an atypically safe cap choice: a black beanie tucked behind his ears like he’s starring in a Wes Anderson film. (To be fair, this is exactly how everyone in Portland dresses.) If Melo’s history tells us anything, though, it’s that this is only the start of a beautiful headwear journey. The former Knick has worn tophats that make him look like a Batman villain threatening to freeze Gotham, straight-from-Moscow fur trapper hats, and enough berets to make him an honorary Marxist. A theory: Melo, the Hatsman, is a perfect reflection of Melo, the basketball player. These are tough shots he’s taking! Not a fit in the modern NBA, ill-advised, something you’ll never see during a Houston Rockets game: isn’t the beret really the basketball equivalent of a pull-up midranger? While a baseball cap is a lay-up, and whatever Cam Newton’s pilfered from the Mad Hatter’s hovel are high-variance three-pointers, the beret is neither painfully simple nor impressively difficult to pull off. The same can be said for the bucket hats Melo loves. That these hats aren’t totally off the beaten path might be what mystifies Melo’s stylist, Khalilah Beavers, who doesn’t seem to understand the fascination with her client’s hats. For the Win interviewed Beavers about the military-style outfit Melo wore in 2012 that is as memorable as any goofy NBA outfit. Here are some choice quotes from that interview: “Literally it’s just a regular hat. It’s just leather — that was all there was to it.” “It was just a hat I thought was cool and he loved it.” “‘It’s a cool hat,’ she said, understandably a bit exasperated.” “It’s a cool brown leather hat.” Around the third or fourth insistence that this is actually a “Cool Hat,” the line takes on the feel of a kid lying to their parents. It’s time to own up to it and admit none of Melo’s headwear can accurately be described as “just a regular hat”—and that’s a good thing. Anthony’s shown a career-long commitment to unique hats (Just look at the below bandana-print bucket hat he wore all the way back in 2006). At this point, it’s as much his thing as hoodies and a pathological dedication to taking unadvised shots. You don’t get to collaborate with Williamsburg’s favorite milliner Goorin Brothers by wearing “regular hats.” Here, a few more of our favorites.

      " Subscribe Now Get the Magazine 1 Year for $15 A new reports says consumers want brands to agree with their politics. How did we get here? Would you invite your jeans to a dinner party? And if you did, would you agree with everything they have to say about abortion rights and gun control? Does your car agree with your views on immigration? Is your beer telling you what you want to hear about the 2020 election? If you think this sounds crazy, then you are correct—and also out of step with the rest of America. Jeans, car manufacturers, alcoholic beverages, and many other consumer brands are increasingly perceived as bipartisan enterprises, with political beliefs, principles, and agendas that drive our decisions to purchase, or not purchase. More specifically, a new report in the Wall Street Journal finds that brands, including clothing brands, are increasingly finding themselves aligned with the Republican or Democratic party, leading consumers to make purchases that are informed more and more by a brand’s perceived place on the bipartisan political spectrum. From 2004 to 2018, the customer bases for a number of clothing brands have become “closely associated” with political parties. The most striking shift has been in jeans, that most American of fashion items (although, like that other most American talisman—fries—jeans are actually French). Over that 15 year period, Wrangler’s customer base shifted 13% from Democrats towards Republicans, while Levi’s shifted towards Democrats. Customer bases for Abercrombie & Fitch and The Gap also shifted slightly to the left, while Walmart shifted to the right. The Journal reports that “there is no simple explanation behind those consumer moves.” Brands’ more vocal support of political causes, like Levi’s advocacy for gun control, have led to some consumer divisiveness. (The Journal quotes Nike legend Phil Knight giving a talk earlier this year at Stanford’s business school about Nike’s controversial 2018 Colin Kaepernick advertisement: “It doesn’t matter how many people hate your brand as long as enough people love it.”) The shifts are also the result of socio-geographic changes: rural areas, mostly found in the west and midwest, tilt increasingly Republican, and tend to favor Wrangler’s cowboy image. Metropolitan areas skew more Democratic, and are therefore drawn to Levi’s more liberal image. One lifelong Wrangler consumer told the paper he bought two pairs of Levi’s last year because of the latter’s views on gun control. Admittedly, the logic behind the shifts feels a bit hazy: Wranglers have a sort of mall-variety Clint Eastwood appeal, while Levi's has made political advocacy core to its brand, donating money to gun control nonprofits and signed amicus briefs opposed to Donald Trump's immigration ban in 2017. It’s possible that the taste for one is an expression of distaste for the other. In a month of news dominated by pants, this should come as little surprise—and indeed, to those who closely followed the revelations of whistleblower Christopher Wylie, it’s old news that political beliefs are closely aligned with the kinds of brands towards which a consumer gravitates. Wylie came forward last year with revelations that political marketing firm Cambridge Analytica used Facebook likes to target pro-Trump advertising, building an algorithm that marked fans of fashion brands like Wrangler and L.L. Bean as potential Trump supporters, and those who supported brands like Kenzo as unlikely to engage with right-leaning advertising. Only an evil, secretive British marketing firm could get away with billing politicians for the right to learn that a Paris-based Japanese fashion brand that drove countless fashion bloggers to spend $500 on a cartoon tiger sweater probably didn’t read Brietbart. But this new report suggests that brands are now taking more overt advantage of those associations, and consumers are responding with enthusiasm. The public relations firm Edelman, which has studied this partisan consumer shift and shared its data with the Journal, surveyed 1,000 Americans, finding that almost 60% said last year that they would “choose, switch, avoid or boycott a brand based on its stand on societal issues,” compared to just 47% in 2017. The partisan divide of American politics, the Journal writes, has “drifted into the world of shopping malls and online stores.” In the past, consumers might be inspired to buy a certain brand’s clothing because of some perception of coolness or because of quality. If a brand’s values played into consumer choice in the past, it was usually because those values were inherent to the company’s purpose: a brand designed to serve a customer with highly developed taste but moderate expendable income, as Supreme and other streetwear brands initially set out to be, or women’s fashion brand that celebrated working women, like Diane Von Furstenberg during her 1970s Second Wave ascent. But now, it seems that consumers expect brands to take a position on a wider range of issues that have little to do with clothing itself. Giving someone money isn’t merely an exchange for goods—it’s a form of advocacy. This isn’t limited to mass consumer brands, either. High-fashion brands over the past year have touted their sustainability and diversity efforts as a means to set themselves apart in the marketplace. Like Levi’s support for gun control or Nike’s Kaepernick ad, these are not troubling positions to take, and indeed, it’s hard to imagine how large-scale support for diversity, sustainability, and social reform could have anything but positive repercussions--aside from some consumer fatigue and possible cynicism. It puts designers in the position of trying to outdo each other’s altruism rather than innovate and say something meaningful about the time in which we live. But what’s striking is the shift in consumer expectations: quality, artistic creation, or individuality are no longer paramount factors in spending money on clothes. These were the principles on which fashion was created, but now what matters is whether the brand agrees with what you believe. Wearing clothing, or the desire to participate in fashion, is becoming another way in which people confirm their biases. Brands, to the delight or revulsion of consumers, are becoming just as politically active and vocal as consumers. The ramifications of the 2014 Supreme Court Citizens United decision that ruled corporations have many of the same rights as private citizens are unraveling with dystopian malaise in our...closets. Brands, you see, are people too. Subscribe now and get a FREE weekender bag and the GQ Style Guide. Follow @GQ for photos of celebrities, what to wear to work, and more. © 2019 Condé Nast.

      " Subscribe Now Get the Magazine 1 Year for $15 The watch, commissioned by the Royal Italian Navy, has outlived its origins. Maybe the best way to explain the watchmaker Panerai’s appeal is by reference to the kinds of wrists its watches usually land on. Forget James Bond—Panerai makes beefy, brawny watches worn by the beefier, brawnier likes of Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger. And unlike other manufacturers, which evolved to eventually focus on hard-wearing timepieces, Panerai was from the beginning defined by deep-diving tool watch production, and the kind of out-there technological breakthroughs that industry requires. Right out of the gate, the brand's Radiomir introduced new standards while literally glowing like a radioactive beacon, its long, thorny history shedding light on some of the gnarlier corners of the 20th century. If all of menswear history can be traced back to military uniforms, a certain portion of the watch world has a similar connection to Panerai's WWII-era inventions. Giovanni Panerai first opened the doors of Officine Panerai on Florence’s Ponte alle Grazie in 1860; evenutally, the business was taken over at the turn of the century by Guido Panerai, Giovanni’s grandson. The world was changing radically. With ugly wars on the horizon, and the industrial revolution in full swing, Panerai shifted its efforts towards the production of precision instruments, including depth gauges and compasses. Diver’s instruments were by no means a Panerai invention, but the luminous material found on their dials was. Patented in France in 1916, the brand’s proprietary compound was called “Radiomir,” thanks to the fine, radium-based-powder that afforded its luminous properties. Though highly radioactive (with exposure now known to result in anemia, bone fractures, and necrosis), the powdered substance was particularly useful for Panerai’s products, which needed to function in the gloomy depths of the ocean. The Royal Italian Navy, not one to turn down a chance to literally see in the dark, in turn commissioned Panerai to produce a similarly luminous timepiece for underwater use. Covertly manufactured under top-secret classification, this timepiece was named for that special compound—the Radiomir. With tensions rising, and the second World War fast approaching, the 47 mm Radiomir was introduced to Royal Italian Navy divers in 1936. Known as the Ref. 3646, these luminous watches featured cushion-shaped cases crafted out of stainless steel, which were secured to heavy duty leather straps using a set of welded wire lugs. (These watches were powered by hand-wound movements supplied and signed by Rolex—considered the best under demanding conditions.) As the war progressed, so too did the Radiomir. The reference’s dials became more legible and luminous as Panerai experimented with new manufacturing techniques, and the case received an entire redesign at the request of the Navy. Starting in 1940, Radiomirs were manufactured out of a single block of steel. Following the war, the Radiomir would then be upsized to an astounding 60 mm for the Egyptian Navy, and fitted with a unique crown guard similar to that of the brand’s Luminor models. Throughout these several decades of production, all of Panerai’s watches and supply contracts were classified secrets, which were further classified after the war had ended—meaning the now-wildly popular line of timepieces was unavailable and unknown to the masses. With the war over, the brand returned to the dedicated production of diving instruments. For 21 years, that remained the case—until 1993, when the brand shifted toward producing timepieces for civilian use. Today, Panerai’s history influences the aesthetics of its current lineup, which includes several Radiomir models, though under the ownership of Richemont, the watchmaker is a different animal altogether. Its grassroots, military-contracted past has been traded for a present informed by the luxury market: the watches now use smaller, in-house movements. While the worn-by-the-Navy 47mm watches are no longer produced using radium, their defining style has been maintained and celebrated through pieces like the true to form “PAM448” Radiomir, and the more recent Radiomir 1940. And while the Italian Navy was devastated by the war, its commissioned watch has had a long, glowing-in-the-dark afterlife. Subscribe now and get a FREE weekender bag and the GQ Style Guide.

      " Subscribe Now Get the Magazine 1 Year for $15 Christie’s is auctioning off a large collection of the streetwear brand’s decks, apparel, and ephemera. It turns out that knives, of the stabby slice-into-a-pot-roast type, make surprisingly good auction fare. A 400-year-old German knife set, part of an “Important Silver” sale at Christie’s auction house, moved for £1,240,000 in 2005. Just this month, Knives, an Andy Warhol painting, sold for $3,015,000 on a Thursday morning in New York. Now, knives are again coming under the hammer at Christie’s. But these blades are neither historic artifacts nor works of art painted by an all-time great. So what makes them auction worthy? They’re made by the New York–based billion-dollar skatewear brand Supreme. The “Group of Knives” (estimate: $200 to $300), which includes a crucifix necklace with a hidden blade, just as God would have always wanted, is just a small part of an auction including “the largest selection of Supreme ever offered at Christie’s,” according to a press release. The collection—consisting of those knives, many of the brand’s most important skateboards, pieces from its very desirable collaboration with Louis Vuitton, plus the Supreme pinball machine (!!), among other items—will come up for auction alongside luxury handbags this winter at Christie’s. The Supreme Fender Stratocaster guitar, with an estimate of $3,000 to $5,000. Auction organizers have fallen hard for Supreme over the past couple years. This January, Sotheby’s sold a comprehensive collection of the brand’s skate decks at the very bottom of its low-end estimate—which was still $800,000. For Supreme skateboards. In 2018, Artcurial hosted a Supreme-only auction that brought in $1 million in total. You might be wondering: Huh? Here is another question, for once you’ve composed yourself: What makes Supreme such a natural fit in the gilded world of auction houses that typically focus on high-priced art, cars, jewelry, and watches? For starters, Supreme is singular in the world of streetwear and fashion. No other streetwear brand has been able to muster a comparable 25-year sustained run of success and influence. The brand’s pieces have been subject to bidding, albeit in less glitzy places like eBay and Grailed, almost since its inception. Supreme is also an easy sell for auction-house department heads because the brand has long intertwined itself with countless gallery-grade artists—the very same ones that might come up for auction at, say, Christie’s—over the years. “Some of the most prolific and important contemporary artists of our time were collaborating with Supreme to make specific boards,” says Caitlin Donovan, the house’s head of sales for handbags and accessories. Naturally, the Christie’s auction includes decks printed with designs from Kaws, Jeff Koons, Takashi Murakami, Marilyn Minter, Damien Hirst, and George Condo. Most importantly, people are ravenous for Supreme goods. Although they might not meet the prices typically achieved by Christie’s’ other categories, the collecting community, as evidenced by the line outside the brand’s shop on Thursdays, is religious in its devotion to Supreme. What’s clear for Christie’s, and for Donovan, is that the biggest cop of all is the new group of collectors Supreme will bring into the auction house’s fold. Supreme skate decks, pinball machines, and knife sets are the bait; the trap is made out of Pablo Picasso ceramics and Takashi Murakami paintings. “So whether it be a Supreme skateboard or a jacket or a motorcycle, they will bring in a new, younger audience to Christie’s,” says Donovan. “And those are people that have a lot of room and power to grow over time and go into other departments.” Christie’s is making an educated bet that if these people like to collect box-logo T-shirts, they might, down the line, be bitten by the collecting bug again. Hell, they’ve probably been bitten by it before. “You look at the Patek [Philippe] market, the Kaws market, and Warhol,” says Donovan. “I think that there's a lot of overlap.” But Christie’s doesn’t even need those customers to fall down the collecting rabbit hole into more expensive categories for this particular auction to be a success. And that speaks to the way streetwear is perceived today. In 2019, this once-niche corner of the fashion world has fully seeped into every luxury category. The streetwear-adjacent Kaws sells $14.7 million paintings. Virgil Abloh heads up one of the most storied European fashion houses. And separating Supreme knives from Chanel and Hermès handbags is no longer essential—or at least obvious. Working on this Supreme auction, Donovan says, has “opened my eyes to an entirely different collecting culture.” There are no concrete plans to bring other streetwear brands into the fold, or at least no plans Donovan can tell me about—but she promises she has “lofty ideas of how I’m going to take this and move forward.” Then she refers offhandedly to the burgeoning new category at Christie’s that Supreme is a part of. Maybe it’s not official, but it might as well be. The Supreme auction, Donovan says, marks the house’s first adventure into what she defines as “the Hype Collecting Department.” Subscribe now and get a FREE weekender bag and the GQ Style Guide.

      " Subscribe Now Get the Magazine 1 Year for $15 John Malkovich pairs no less than three denims together for one #BigFitoftheDay. Denim is the most humble of materials—it is the Saltine cracker, the cardboard box, the pigeon of fashion. But when you combine multiple denims, they become something transcendent. A package of crackers. A box of other boxes. A flight of pigeons. If that was a little too philosophical for those of us still working on the Fit 1.0 operating system, check out John Malkovich’s extremely 3.0 outfit for elucidation. Warning: you may need to update your browser to feel this energy. Carpenter jeans, a denim chore coat, and an indigo button-up shirt beneath. That’s not humble—it’s majestic. Three layers of denim. A jean ménage à trois. A dungaree-driven triptych that would get even the most denim-agnostic among us to bow our heads in worship. Even if we discovered a portal that allowed us to crawl into John Malkovich’s head, we would not have been able to conjure the supreme denim splendidness of this Big Fit of the Day. But we’ll bet you have all the ingredients in your closet right now. Add a beret and a scarf—two certified Incognito Celebrity staples—and you’re basically John Malkovich. Well, probably not.

      " Subscribe Now Get the Magazine 1 Year for $15 From chunky-as-hell cable knits to prim-and-proper cardigans, GQ’s Best Stuff has all the impossibly soft, profoundly warm layers to swaddle yourself in through April. Remember that guy Bryce you couldn't stand in high school? The one who was valedictorian and the star quarterback and the lead in the musical and always really nice to you, which somehow just made you hate him even more? Cashmere is the Bryce of fabrics. It’s the strongest and warmest and softest and swankiest form of wool there is, and it’s here to take your dreary winter wardrobe to bold new heights of handsomeness and coziness. Instead of harboring any deep-seated resentment, though, the real issue you’ll have here is settling on the right cashmere sweater for you—especially given the explosion of reasonably affordable options that's flooded the market in recent years. To help make that decision as simple and streamlined as possible, we found you 14 of the very best men's cashmere sweaters on the planet—from the gigantic flexes worth dropping a paycheck on to the budget-friendly crewnecks you should cop in every color. You'll look even better in them than Bryce did the night he was crowned prom king. Stupid Bryce. You don’t have to do much to men's cashmere sweaters for them to make a big impression. The fabric itself speaks volumes, so even the most basic of sweaters can instantly make an outfit feel a bit luxer, more considered, and altogether elevated. (Just look at how put together guys like David Beckham and Justin Theroux look wearing plain-jane pullovers.) At the same time, though, a little visual flourish never hurt anybody, which is why we love these crewnecks from Todd Snyder: they still let the cashmere do the talking, but the raglan stripes at the shoulders steps things up the subtlest of notches. Most cashmere stuff feels very East Coast prep—all strait-laced and solid-colored—which makes sense, because the East Coast is where it’s cold. Back in 2007, though, L.A. designer Greg Chait flipped that on its head: under the moniker The Elder Statesman, he started making cashmere blankets, then sweaters and ponchos and socks and stuffed animals, with a distinctly Californian vibe. The stuff is all tie dyed and dip dyed, sometimes emblazoned with palm trees or magic mushrooms or the checkerboard from your trusty Vans. The wavy pullovers are the perfect thing for a chilly night on the beach, or for shaking up your cold-weather fits with a reminder that summer is just around the corner. At some point in the last decade or so, a weird thing happened: cashmere, the rarest and most luxurious of wools, became way more accessible. These days, you can find pure cashmere sweaters hovering around the $100 mark in just about every mall chain store—like if you could suddenly cop a Bugatti for the price of a Kia. But not all affordable cashmere sweaters are built equal, and for our money, Everlane's versions are tops: they’re knit from Grade-A Mongolian fibers—less prone to pilling—with reinforced necklines and cuffs for extra durability. Cop a V-neck—they’re back, baby!—and tuck it in to swervy trousers with nothing underneath. Sometimes lost in all the mystique surrounding Brunello Cucinelli—from the 173-acre medieval hamlet in Umbria where he and 800 of his employees live and work in perfect harmony, to the billionaire summits he hosts on occasion—is the fact that guy makes really, really beautiful clothes. Sweaters like this one are the reason he’s long held the crown as the King of Cashmere: the knit work is crisp and immaculate, the fit is snug and luxurious. It’s perfect to the point that upon seeing its near-$3,000 price tag, all you can really do is shrug and mumble, “Checks out.” Some days, when it’s freezing and you’re cranky and maybe a little hungover, you just need to swim in cashmere. You want to be enveloped by the stuff, to have it shield you from the outside world and everyone in it while still making you look really damn good in the process. That’s what this enormous ribbed mock neck from The Row will do for you. It’s cut slouchy and drapey and will swallow you whole, but is exactingly engineered to do so in the most flattering way possible. You almost definitely own a slim black turtleneck, which is elegant and goes great with everything, but a touch too delicate to stand up to any sort of windchill. Maybe you’ve got one of those chunky Irish fisherman numbers, too—it’s rugged and handsome and makes you feel like the commander in Dunkirk, but it’s too warm to wear indoors and about as comfortable as a Brillo pad. Well, fashion Goldilocks, here’s the middle ground to add to your rotation: Michael Kors’ just-right cashmere turtleneck. Substantial enough to keep out the cold, trim enough to fit under a sport coat, softer than the dulcet tones of your favorite ASMR YouTuber.

      " Subscribe Now Get the Magazine 1 Year for $15 On Saturday, Styles had a night of a thousand fits. Harry Styles is a glamour-puss for the zeitgeist: a man who gleefully mines the sartorial glory days of rock ‘n roll with his eyes firmly fixed on the future. That’s the story his clothing told this past weekend on Saturday Night Live, anyway, where he was both host and musical guest, electrically likeable and as funny anyone who’s actually in the show’s cast. As Styles joked in his opening monologue, where he played monologuing chanteur at the piano: “Everyone thinks the cast does a lot of cocaine. They don’t. That’s why the show’s not good anymore.” The ’60s, the ’70s, and a droll treatment of the doldrums of the 2010s, all in one moment. Rare is the person who “everyone”—whatever that means now—might “fall in love with,” but Styles still manages to do that nearly obsolete thing the best celebrities do: charm us, and look great doing it. That’s the Styles Style. On Saturday, there was also Styles’s...style: in short, he wore the hell out of a handful of outfits, and in the process laid out nothing less than where fashion is heading. As the apocalypse winds down a banner decade, everyone is looking back on changes and paradigm shifts, sharing photos of ourselves ten years ago with bad hair and this year with less bad hair. But it’s also worth wondering—and possibly less depressing to do so—what the next decade in fashion will look like. Styles represents precisely that, as his SNL night of a thousand big fits demonstrated: creative, a mix of brands big and small, and elegant. It’s a new era in which getting dressed—and really living in the clothes—is more vital a part of self-expression than it’s ever been before. Styles mixes big dog designers with the up-and-comers, foretelling an interest not in mixing not high and low, but huge and little. He’s long been a Gucci guy, clutching farm animals in their tailoring campaigns since spring 2018, and co-chairing this year’s Met Gala with creative director Alessandro Michele. (Styles wore a tulle-bodice jumpsuit and a single dangly earring.)  But if that kind of big brand contract used to mean you wore one designer and nothing else, Styles plays a little bit faster and looser, wearing a Marni shirt, or that Lanvin sheep-print sweater vest, with his Gucci trousers—two brands with new, young designers still establishing their vision, paired with a billion-dollar brand. This doesn’t sound particularly revolutionary, but it is a slight kind of liberty (or even rebellion) that makes him look less like a guy who’s been plugged into the fashion world and more like someone who just loves clothes. Maybe it’s that people are getting cynical about the sameness that those big brand contracts involve, or maybe it’s just that designers are getting more comfortable with—or realistic about—their brands being seen as a part of a wardrobe. Even more inspiring is his interest in even younger or more obscure designers: he’s been particularly fanatical about the work of Central Saint Martins student Harris Reed, and also wore on Saturday night a handful of pieces by Bode. If the last decade was about pairing fast fashion knockoffs with the real deal—a story that did not end well—now, the idea is to tuck your Christopher Kane “Sex” T-shirt into your Gucci trousers, and throw a Bode workshirt over it. Styles emerged as a fashion icon for his individuality—that sense that, well, he could pull that off. But now his style has evolved into something trendsetting rather than quirky. His dangly earring at the Met Gala started a craze, but so too did his wider embrace of sexiness in fashion, a gender-fluid vision based on the drama and sensuality of womenswear rather than men’s suiting. As his black Gucci sequin jumpsuit with a plunging neckline reminded us, he’s plundered from golden age Mick Jagger, sometimes down to the way he puts his hand on the back of his hip, but he manages to create a lightness and joy where Jagger stood for a glinty bitchiness. It feels modern, directional, rather than nostalgic. All of which makes for a fun bit of runway cat-and-mouse, but it also underscores that Styles, along with Timothée Chalamet, is one of the only men outside the fashion industry who is taking risks in fashion, and using it for self-expression and exploration. As Michele told GQ in our November New Masculinity issue, Harry “is so relaxed in his body, and completely open to listen to himself…. He's the only one on the market, I think, that is really in contact with his feminine part.” If the rest of Hollywood and the music industry has yet to catch up, the increasing dominance of the Styles Style suggests they likely will soon. Even his louche opening monologue suit, a rare straight-from-the-Gucci-runway look, tells a story that anyone can pluck from: a new age of elegance and eccentricity. That attitude—an absolute joy in getting dressed, not seen since the society doyennes who assembled museum-worthy wardrobes of couture—is both contagious and prophetic, pointing to an age where fashion fanaticism departs from an exasperating call-out puritanism and moves towards something more jubilant.

      " Subscribe Now Get the Magazine 1 Year for $15 Also this week, Ed Sheeran finally makes his watch obsession public. Does Pierce Brosnan’s new watch of choice double as a grappling hook? Does it blow up on demand should the world need saving? Almost certainly not. As 007, Brosnan handled plenty of advanced timepieces, but he’s gravitated to simpler ones in his post-Bond days. Case in point: the Speake-Marin Resilience that Brosnan’s wore frequently over the past few years. Maybe it wouldn’t be useful in a mission that required him to defuse a nuke and get the girl (all before the bar closes), but it has one great super-spy feature: the simple Resilience looks great with a tuxedo and on a red carpet. That’s about all you need after handing over your Walther PPK. Also this week: Ed Sheeran’s very special Patek Philippe Nautilus and Travis Scott’s Richard Mille. Peter Speake-Marin founded his eponymous watch brand in 2002 and brought Brosnan on as an ambassador in 2015. As the story goes, Brosnan, though he wasn’t Bond any longer (or does the title stick for life, like President?), was filming a different spy film (Survivor) in which his character wore Speake-Marine. So although the name on the dial has changed, Brosnan isn’t giving up on wearing for-spy timepieces. Today, having your very own signature watch made by Richard Mille, whose baseline editions come in limited quantities and command huge prices, is seemingly essential to becoming an A-tier celebrity. Everyone in Hollywood seems to be playing in a high-priced game of anything-you-can-do-I-can-do-better as they attempt to acquire the most limited of limited-editions. To that end, Travis Scott appeared courtside during a Lakers game this week wearing an RM-011 “Asia Boutique” edition. No surprises here: the watch was christened with this particular nickname because it was only available at Richard Mille’s Hong Kong and Singapore boutiques. There are only 50 of these RM-011s with a brown case in the world. The rapper clearly has a thing for this shade of brown, which resembles the colorway of his collaborative Air Jordan 1. To paraphrase John Wick: Yeah, I’m thinking Kevin Hart’s back. This week, he made his first appearance since a scary September car crash, and the comedian wasted no time reasserting himself as one of Hollywood’s best watch collectors. Hart popped up at the People’s Choice Awards wearing a Patek Philippe Grand Complication, which tells wearers the date, phase the moon is in, day of the week, and—oh, yeah—the time. The watch isn’t available at retail anymore, but one went for $218,750 at Christie’s auction house last March. When the Great Depression wreaked havoc on individuals and businesses alike in the early 1930s, everyone was looking for a life raft, including the watchmakers at IWC. As luck would have it, one was thrown directly the brand’s way by Rodrigues and Antonio Teixera. The two Portueguese watch dealers asked IWC for a men’s wristwatch that kept incredibly accurate time. IWC filled this request with a model that, up to that point, was only known as Model 228. To grease the wheels in this new market, IWC rechristened the watch the Portuguese (it was renamed the Portugieser in 2015). The dressy timepiece is now the most popular in IWC’s line, and apparently a favorite of Chris Evans. This particular model is “ideal for a more slender wrist,” according to IWC’s website, which is a funny thing to say about a watch that belongs to the former Captain America. DJ Khaled attended the launch party for Pharrell’s new Richard Mille wearing a Rolex Sky Dweller with that Froot-Loop-sized subdial. While both watches are air-travel minded, they have very different ambitions. Pharrell’s RM 52-02 displays the perspective from Mars; the Sky Dweller is intended to serve jetsetting travelers in less far-flung areas of the galaxy. Longtime watch fan Ed Sheehan finally made his timepiece obsession public in a letter posted to the site Hodinkee. “Hello there, I'm Ed,” the singer starts. “I've been collecting watches since I was 20 years old.” Sheeran owns as many cool watches as the residual checks from “The Shape of You” affords, but the one that really stands out is a Patek Philippe Nautilus 5726A. Sheeran took the ultra-rare watch to the customizers at Bamford and blacked it out, made the hour markers red, and etched his initials on it. “I know it's a sin to pimp out a Patek, but it really is cool,” Sheeran writes. It’s a one-of-one watch...sort of! Sheeran’s inspiration for the watch was an almost exact replica he made as a gift for his “musical hero,” the only difference is the set of initials on the dial. (Smart money says that watch’s brother reads “EC” for the reclusive watch-collecting rock god Eric Clapton.) Basically: These are the most expensive BFF bracelets in existence. \\ Subscribe now and get a FREE weekender bag and the GQ Style Guide.

Spike Lee: sit back, relax, and start blasting Hoku's greatest hits because this really is the Perfect Day. Not only did Spike's beloved New York Knickerbockers walk away with a win against the Dallas Mavericks (and NY's estranged Large Adult Son Kristaps Porzignis), but the director is also our Big Fit of the Day. Make all the jokes you want about Spike's fit—\"He looks like an Eileen Fisher ad for the color blind\", or maybe \"Why is he dressed like a co-host of The View???—they are not strong enough to overpower what is CLEARLY an enormous fit. Typically, showing out for your favorite team and looking stylish is an either-or situation—you simply can't have both! That rule does not apply to Spike, though, who wore a trippy bisected neon-orange turtleneck, matching citrus-colored shoes, and a fedora in the material of the season: leather. We also need to talk about his turtleneck's unique functionality. Shouldn't more bulky sweaters come with holes at the armpit? This is an apex transitional garment, folks. For being living proof that, yes, you really can have it all, Spike is today's Big Fit of the Day. Subscribe now and get a FREE weekender bag and the GQ Style Guide.

      " Subscribe Now Get the Magazine 1 Year for $15 One answer: pants are the only thing that really matters in fashion. Earlier this week, a friend texted me: “Why are people talking about pants as if there have never been pants before?” (She asked to be identified as “an anonymous woman who has known about pants for years.”) It was true: my friend had committed a mortal sin—logging on—and discovered that the timeline was absolutely flooded with pants news. It began last week, when Harry Styles shared the cover of his upcoming album, a fish-eye shot of the singer disco-dancing in a pair of Gucci wide-leg sailor trousers, photographed by the great glossy-surrealist fashion photographer Tim Walker. This week, there was Rachel Syme’s ode to the high-waisted jeans on the New Yorker’s website, which drove a legion of women to rhapsodize about their own experiences with high-waisted jeans and their alleged butt-enhancement qualities. “If your high-waisted pants aren’t giving you a wedgie or a yeast infection, are they too low-cut?” tweeted...the New Yorker. (To be fair, the pants worn by man who inspired New Yorker mascot Eustace Tilley give Styles a run for his money.) Bringing the pants craze to a fever pitch was the release of another fish-eye Walker image of Styles, reclined in a pose that exaggerated his pant legs into two huge whales. They looked totally outrageous. Skinny jeans haven’t been the default silhouette for a few years now, but it felt like Styles was throwing down the gauntlet. You thought my pants were big from that angle? Check them out from the ground! Suddenly, everyone was a pants expert, observing pant trends, advancing pant conspiracies, celebrating pant-forward outfits, issuing warnings against those who are wearing the wrong pants, and in some cases, simply purporting to know about pants. To answer my friend’s question: people are freaking out about pants because pants are the final frontier in directional fashion. In this anything-goes era that privileges micro-trends—neon one month and Raf Simons-inspired graphics the next—and personal style over sweeping ideaslike hem lengths and silhouettes, pants are the only thing that can divide or unite an audience. This is, in part, practical: pants are probably the most utilitarian part of an outfit. Like, I guess you could say that legally, you have to wear pants. You don’t need a sweater, or a jacket, or even a crossbody bag (I know!), the way you need pants. Any tweak to a pant, therefore, feels more radical than messing with proportions or color on a jacket, or a sweater, or socks. Take a look at the e-commerce platform of your choice. The weirdest (and in my humble opinion, best) stuff: all pants. Of course there are outliers—the Vuitton harnesses, for example, felt revolution-adjacent, but harnesses were an invention rather than an evolution of a previously recognized form. (An invention by Helmut Lang, by the way, who seems to be responsible for every workwear-adjacent trend that designers from Virgil Abloh to Demna Gvasalia have revived over the past five years.) Again: you don’t need a harness like you need pants. And much wilder than Timothée Chalamet’s harness? His unrelenting commitment to an unusual, Haider Ackerman-inspired style of tucking in your pants. Like everything else in clothes today, there is no “correct” pant. The pants that started kickstarted the high-waisted jeans trend in 2015, Rachel Comey’s Legion Jeans, didn’t lead to a ritual dismissal of every other kind of jean, as trends once did, but rather a wave of relief for wealthy Brooklyn matriarchs, who seem to wear those jeans, or some take on them, exclusively. Gone are the days when Hedi Slimane could hand down a skinny jean mandate. But pants, which involve a level of commitment, a kind of daring, that no other article of clothing can match, are nonetheless the final frontier in directional fashion. Think about Flea’s stuffed animal pants, also known as the #1 Pants of All Time. Flea would’ve just been a guy with a weird thing for stuffed animals if the piece had just been a sweatshirt. But as pants? They made Flea an icon. Subscribe now and get a FREE weekender bag and the GQ Style Guide. Follow @GQ for photos of celebrities, what to wear to work, and more. © 2019 Condé Nast.

      " Subscribe Now Get the Magazine 1 Year for $15 A few years since we last saw the style, they're all of a sudden covetable again. Remember the sock sneaker? Just two short years ago, the ultra-cozy kicks were everywhere, second in hype only to the massive ugly-on-purpose sneakers that still dominate the space to this day. And for a good reason: the one-two combo of a cozy knit upper and hyper-sleek silhouette was a surefire way to add a degree of advanced style to any outfit. Of course, in recent seasons, the fervor for the sock sneaker has slowed down—after the Triple S, Balenciaga's second-biggest shoe is its gnarly off-road shoe, not its sock. However, Alyx, the high-end label best known for playing outside the menswear box (and that Kanye West-approved chest rig), has just released its ultra-luxurious take on the style—and it was certainly worth the wait. This is just the latest in red-hot footwear to come from Alyx. Recently, the brand has released everything from a dressy lace-up derby shoe with an exaggerated hiking outsole to a maximalist camo sneaker produced in collaboration with Nike. (Let’s just say Alyx designer Matthew Williams has the range.) This designer sock sneaker features a dreamy palette of whites and greys, with a few contrasting pops of darker shades. The elongated knit upper wraps snuggly up the ankle, and the futuristic silhouette sits on top of one serious treaded sole. While the cozy sleekness feels reminiscent of the sock sneaker explosion from a couple of years back, the pumped-up sole adds a spark of utilitarian newness and technical edge to the style. It was sharp of Williams and Alyx to wait for sock sneaker madness to die down before unleashing these on the world. Back then, there were so many high-profile version of the style: the Vetements x Reebok Sock Runner,  Balenciaga’s Speed Trainer, and the Adidas x Gosha Rubchinskiy Ace 16, to name a few. These might have risked getting lost in the mix. However, the boom having slowed down, this sneaker from Alyx cuts through the noise, and the addition of the trek-like sole makes it feel as fresh as any other cutting-edge sneaker that has dropped this year.

      " Subscribe Now Get the Magazine 1 Year for $15 The rapper brings #BigFitoftheDay energy to his courtside Lakers seats. Courtside Lakers seats have always been a big deal. Jack Nicholson! James Goldstein! Penny Marshall! Ever since the Showtime squads, celebrities have turned out en masse. That was technically still true during the team's grim post-Kobe years; your George Lopezes and Ashton Kutchers of the greater Los Angeles area have still found their feet on the floor. But ever since LeBron James joined the team in last year, the energy in the arena seems to have increased in both quality and amplitude. And this year, with Anthony Davis joining the squad, Lavar Ball hightailing it to New Orleans, and the Lake Show sitting atop the Western Conference, the vibes have been even stronger. Just look at Travis Scott. The Astroworld rapper hit Wednesday night's Lakers-Warriors tilt fitted head to toe: leather (or maybe just waxed-cotton) jeans, one of Junya Watanabe's reworked Carhartt jackets, a matching brown hat, exquisite ice, his newest pair of collaborative Nikes, and—the capper—a pair of sunglasses that, had they existed in 1979, would have appeared in these exact same seats on Jack Nicholson's face that year. (They wouldn't have existed then, because they're a Mykita collab from Helmut Lang's Spring 2020 collection.) Laker fever: Travis Scott definitely has it!

      " Subscribe Now Get the Magazine 1 Year for $15 Pesci has made Goodfellas-style collars a signature of nearly every one of his films. Brand Loyalty is a column that explores our cultural obsession with brands—like Kanye West’s discovery of Vetements, Kristen Stewart’s interest in Outdoor Voices, or the brief golden era of fashion cellphones. Joe Pesci is an incantation. Just say his name and everything appears: the smokey room, the playing cards, the Cutty Sark and water with no ice, the golf polo, the fedora, the gun. Or the explosions of rage. Of course, in interviews, Joe Pesci barely says a thing. He doesn’t need to. He knows the economy of cool. On the Late Show in the mid-90s, Letterman asks him if he’s good at golf, and Joe Pesci says he shoots a sixteen handicap. “I don’t know what that means,” Letterman says. “Is that good?” Pesci glances at the cigar, shrugs. “Well, I’m sorry,” and takes a long drag. Joe Pesci is a man who knows what he wants and knows everything he’s about. When Joe Pesci plays golf, he’s going to smoke. When Joe Pesci goes on Letterman, he’s going to curse. When Joe Pesci is going to break a rib on the set of a Scorsese film, he’s going to break the exact same rib he broke the first time, 15 years before, which, if you’re Joe Pesci, seems less like a coincidence and more like a commitment to precision. What a weirdo. What a wild card. What a king. Joe Pesci is a genius we hadn’t seen in two decades until Martin Scorsese pulled him out of retirement for The Irishman. But even in retirement, Joe Pesci remained a man with potent style and charisma. Not a fashion icon, but something bigger and better: a man with a look, onscreen and off (mostly on the golf course). Wild black pompadour. That no-bullshit pout. A short guy, I guess, at 5’7’’, but that doesn’t seem quite right. It’s more like he’s compact, with total control over some terrifying energy just underneath. He’s loose and wacky in black leather jackets in My Cousin Vinny, and a coil of well-tailored psychopathy in Scorsese’s Goodfellas—and almost always in a giant spearpoint collar, its sharp leaves plunging down between the lapels of his jacket like two medieval spearheads. It might be the most terrifying garment in cinema history: if Joe Pesci is wearing the spearpoint collar, you know he might kill you. It isn’t that Joe Pesci is always looking for a fight. It’s that—well, I can’t really put it into words, so I’ll let the collar do the talking. The collar that Pesci loves is the product of a bit of Scorsese lore—the director’s father pressed clothing and his mother was a seamstress, and his longtime costume collaborator, Richard Bruno, crafted them specially for most of the cast of Goodfellas, which apparently led to a minor vogue for them in the early ’90s. But the collar was also a staple of New York gangster style in the first half of the 20th century, when suity bravado was a part of the whole threatening package. The spearpoint collar telegraphed class, in that ironically garish sense of the word, and that other great mafia passion, laundry. And while photographs of Frank Costello, Al Capone, and Baby Face Nelson suggest the spearpoint collar was a mugshot staple, Bruno seems to have exaggerated it to outlandish proportions, particularly on Pesci. “Bruno consciously designed the mob attire to echo that of an earlier period,” Variety wrote of the designer’s costumes for Goodfellas, when Bruno died in 2012, “with collars that hide the top part of tie [and] a tab added to the double-lock collar to line up the steep collar points.” The spearpoint collar is best known from Goodfellas, but Pesci started wearing them in his first Scorsese film, 1980’s Raging Bull, which was also a Bruno production. There’s something wild, unhinged about the collar’s maniacal perfection. As the film is set in the ’40s and ’50s, lots of other wiseguys and mob-adjacent guys are wearing them, too. But Pesci’s is huge. There’s barely a spread, so the tie bursts out of it—a foreshadowing of his whole persona. As Pesci skittered across the century in a series of other Scorsese films, the spearpoint collar became his signature, regardless of the period in which the film takes place. Even as, in Goodfellas, the collar becomes fashionable again —a louche, undone lounge lizard eccentricity taken up by Ray Liotta’s Henry Hill and Robert DeNiro’s Jimmy Conway in the 1970s—Pesci sticks with the spearpoint, starched to outrageous, terrifying perfection. It’s like he’s always living in the mafia golden era, when the mob was king and the collars were big, even if every movie he’s starred in has taken place after the collars were in style. But even when everyone else is wearing them, too, they do something more for Pesci. As he holds court in the infamous Funny how seen, needling Henry Hill about being funny like a clown?, his collar points are fangs that could sink into anyone (as it turns out, not Harry, but the restaurant owner who pesters him about the bill a few minutes later). Later, when he’s tricked into thinking he’s going to get made but gets shot in the head instead, it’s almost cartoonishly huge, like a neckbrace, or an exaggerated priest’s collar—reverent, protective, proud, and corrupt. In Casino, it’s constricting, threatening, imposing. He unbuttons it to steal his friend’s wife, but it remains a hand around his neck, growing tighter and tighter until he’s actually buried alive. And of course he wears one in The Irishman, as mob boss Frank Bufalino, with wild patterned ties that Pesci himself insisted on. He’s the eldest, the most important—why wouldn’t he have the biggest collars? Pesci, shorter and wilder-looking than most movie stars, is the kind of guy who might reach for well-tailored clothes to make him look taller, or thinner, or bigger, all of which extremely pointy collars purport to do. But Pesci doesn’t really have the air of someone who has problems to solve. A few minutes into his Letterman interview, he tells a story about a guy standing outside of Radio City Music Hall who called him a wiseguy as he walked by, so “I gave him a f*cking slap—” He stops himself, realizes he just swore on television, says, “Oop,” and just walks offstage with his jacket yanked over his head for protection. Clothes are either armor or weapons. For Joe Pesci, they are always both. Subscribe now and get a FREE weekender bag and the GQ Style Guide.

      " Subscribe Now Get the Magazine 1 Year for $15 The GQ cover star’s new bank account-draining watch goes \"where no one else has ever gone before.\" “Working with Richard Mille provided an opportunity to go where no one else has ever gone before,” Pharrell Williams said via a press release announcing his new collaborative watch. And what unexplored frontier was the musician speaking of? The bottom of the sea, where he sources plastic for his Parley for the Oceans collections? A place where Daft Punk appears sans helmets?? An affordable hotel in Monaco??? Actually: “Mars,” Pharrell says. Today, the GQ cover star announced the RM 52-05, a watch limited to only 30 pieces that costs a number you must be sitting down to read. Are you sitting? OK, it’s $96—I swear to God, sit down. It’s...$969,000. The RM 52-05 is made in typical Richard Mille fashion: it’s got a tonneau- (barrel) shaped case; it’s comprised of precious materials like red gold, cermet (a combination of ceramic and metal), white gold set with diamonds, and titanium; and advanced machinery like the tourbillon sits at the bottom of the watch. What you’ll notice immediately is the astronaut staring back at you from the watch—but what takes a second to sink in is what’s reflected in their visor. The watch depicts an astronaut safely standing on Mars, looking out across its surface, and staring back at our Earth. “A viewpoint expressing one of Pharrell Williams’ dreams,” the press release reads. A collaboration between Pharrell and Richard Mille, who the singer calls the “Timepiece Supreme Creator,” has been a long time coming. Always an early adopter, Pharrell first shouted out RM on the 2006 song “Can I Have It Like That.” He’s also worn several Richard Mille watches over the years, including the 70-01 and the 25-01. Pharrell says the design was inspired by his longtime love of space, and his memory of the Mariner 9 “space probe” that orbited Mars when he was young. He’s determined to complete that Mars mission—even if it is through a watch. “Creating is about shifting the angle at which we look at things, that’s really the only difference, and with the RM 52-05, we’ve looked at Mars from a different angle, an unexpected first-person point of view. In doing so, we’re breaking the mold.” Also breaking the mold: working with a musician on an almost-million-dollar watch. Over the past decade, collaborations have become the most prominent way for brands to scrape together excitement and hype around a new release. An Air Force 1 is cool; an Air Force 1 designed by Travis Scott is one of the most in-demand shoes of the year. Puma was doing, uh, okay; Rihanna came on as creative director and super-charged the business. But rarely do we see these types of collaborations in the watch world. where the prices are higher and consumers are swayed more by tradition than pure hype. That shift is happening ever so slightly, though. Although not a true collaboration, a Rolex Daytona reference 116508 with a green dial has rocketed up in value on the strength of a John Mayer co-sign. Richard Mille has been banging this drum for some time: the brand’s worked with actors like Jackie Chan and Sylvester Stallone in the past. Will Pharrell be enough to move 30 $969,000 watches? Pharrell mentions he first got into Richard Mille watches in the mid-2000s because they were “just like a breath of fresh air, in a category that was stagnant.” Releasing a watch co-designed by Pharrell that shows an astronaut peering down on Earth from Mars is certainly enough to shake things up.

      " Subscribe Now Get the Magazine 1 Year for $15 Most of are us lucky to wear one Big Fit in a single lifetime. The singer just wore three in 24 hours. Eliud Kipchoge ran a marathon in under two hours. Alex Honnold free-soloed 900 feet of sheer rock at Yosemite’s El Capitan cliff. Simone Biles performs a gymnastics maneuver so transcendent and unprecedented that it is referred to simply as “The Biles.” Steph Curry won the NBA’s MVP award in back-to-back seasons. And on the list of the most incredible displays of human potential, those all sit a notch or three below this one: Harry Styles, wearing three colossal fits in a 24-hour span. That’s not a misprint; we’re perfectly aware that, yesterday, we named Harry Styles and his Gucci coat and roomy flared pants the Big Fit of the Day. Today’s fits are just that good. And so, for the first time in Big Fit history, Styles has made an irrefutable claim to the title two consecutive days in a row. He did it in impressive fashion, too, pulling off the elusive Second Fit™ on day two of his sartorial tour de force. Styles’s first look stars a Lanvin sweater with a herd of sheep running across it. The pants are pinstriped, the boots pink, the fit monumental. The second fit, which Styles wore while prepping for his appearance on Saturday Night Live this weekend, is built on the strong foundation of pink checked trousers. On top, he is dressed to see his grandma on Christmas: darling red sweater with a plaid collared shirt peeking out of it. At this moment, Styles is pulling off what we’re referring to as Fitchella—a multi-day event in which he is always the headliner. We made this helpful diagram to help you understand: Folks, we’ve just witnessed history. We are now living in the AHSTBF (After Harry Styles’s Two Big Fits) era. The limits of human potential have been reshaped like wet clay in the masterful hands of Mr. Styles. Someone phone the Guinness World Records; someone phone the Pope. Last night, Styles must have stood in his hotel room with his hands clasped about mid-waist because he knew he had to do it to ‘em. And then, by God, he did. Thank you, Harry.

You could gorge on a bunch of CBD on your way out the door—only, let’s be honest, that stuff is all a bit suspect. You could guzzle some good ol’ fashioned liquid courage the moment you arrive, but you also don’t want to write off the entire next day in bed mainlining Advil and Gatorade. So instead, you do the only reasonable thing left: you slip on an immaculate leather jacket, give yourself a couple of Fonz thumbs in the mirror (“AYY!”), and then proceed to charm the living daylights out of everyone you encounter for the rest of the evening. That’s just what the best leather jackets for men do. They make you stand a little taller, speak with a little more conviction, and seem altogether more alluring. They are like the pill Bradley Cooper takes in the movie Limitless, only they unlock genuine cool instead of psychotic ambition. Of course, confidence of that magnitude doesn’t come cheap. But if you’re ready and raring to invest in one, we’ve pinpointed a baker’s dozen of the very best leather jackets worth your hard-earned dough. Whether you’re looking for an easy-wearing gateway or a galactic-level flex, all of these jackets will keep you feeling like your very best self for years and years to come.

      " Subscribe Now Get the Magazine 1 Year for $15 The State Department official testified in notable neckwear. If you had a hard time following State Department official George Kent’s testimony Wednesday morning in the House’s first public impeachment inquiry hearings, I don’t blame you. The diplomat’s work in Europe is complicated. But I found myself struggling to follow along for a different reason: as Kent responded to congressional questioning about Rudy Giuliani’s one-man Three Stooges act, I couldn’t take my eyes off the spiffy little bowtie capping off Kent’s three-piece suit. He looked less like a diplomat speaking truth to power than a jolly English professor stopping by the woods on a snowy evening. Kent’s choice in neckwear, to be sure, is not the most noteworthy thing to take from the hearing. (That would be, uh, everything else.) But just as Roger Stone’s egregious suits say something about his baroque self-conception, and James Comey’s Chelsea boots reflected his willingness to go cowboy on the matter of a few thousand emails, Kent’s bowtie is not without meaning. It’s worth noting that Kent didn’t merely dress up for the occasion: while his Wikipedia portrait features a traditional necktie, nearly every other photo of him I can find sees him wearing a bowtie, including the one on his State Department profile page. There, a clue: Kent, with degrees from Harvard, Johns Hopkins, and the National Defense University, is also “a proud member of Red Sox Nation.” Ladies and gentlemen, we have ourselves a good, old-fashioned Northeastern Elite! And one, at that, who comes from a long line of service-minded folk. “There has been a George Kent sworn to defend the Constitution for nearly 60 years,” Kent said early in his testimony, referring to earlier generations in his family who had served in government. Nothing suggests a respect for tradition quite like old-fogey neckwear. But outside the family tree, both in Washington and the rest of the world, the bowtie represents a real choice. Because while much of political style is geared toward looking as indistinguishable as possible (remember Robert Mueller’s white button-downs?), the bowtie works differently. It is one of those pieces of clothing—like expensive sneakers, or a summertime scarf—that cannot be worn without its wearer knowing it will send a message. That message is usually something like: I am traditional, but I am also whimsical. Of course, whimsy is in the eye of the beholder: noted Bowtie Boy George F. Will is a conservative commentator and also a baseball fan, and while those might seem like synonyms to you and me, Will seems to consider them representative of vastly different facets of his personality. And whatever attempt Tucker Carlson’s bowtie makes at whimsy falls eternally flat on its face. But in a politico-business moment where the open-necked dress shirt has largely replaced the standard necktie, the bowtie makes an even louder statement. I don’t want to do too much armchair psychologizing, but Kent’s bowtie makes it hard to resist. Is there a better way to signify authority in a televised hearing than by wearing the fustiest neckwear possible? What better communicates “I was the adult in the room”? Of course, Kent’s bowtie isn’t a special impeachment prop—it’s part of his uniform. But that’s enough to scare noted tough guy Sebastian Gorka, who wrote in a tweet—perhaps ironically, definitely inscrutably—that “the way [Kent’s] pocket square matches his delightful bow-tie” marks him “Clearly not a member of the Deep State, who hates @realDonaldTrump.” You can learn a lot about a man from who his enemies are—and even more from the people who publicly trash his bowtie.

      " Subscribe Now Get the Magazine 1 Year for $15 Cardigans are having the most incredible year of their lives! If you pass a cardigan on the street today, be sure to give it a nice pat on the back. Because cardigans are having a very good year. A report released today by the social resale site Poshmark (with the unimpeachable title “Name a More Iconic Duo: Mr. Rogers & The Cardigan”) confirms the sweater’s annus mirabilis. The forthcoming Mr. Rogers biopic A Beautiful Day In the Neighborhood, starring noted sneaker influencer Tom Hanks, has skyrocketed the open-front knit to new heights of popularity and national adoration: since the premiere of the film at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 7, men’s searches for cardigan on Poshmark increased 79%, and purchases on the platform increased a whopping 108%. Undoubtedly, the cardigan cause célèbre was also helped by Kurt Cobain, whose stained and crusy mohair olive green sweater by the defunct Perry Ellis-owned knitwear brand Manhattan Industries sold for a record $334,000 in late October, making it the most expensive sweater ever sold at auction. Nonetheless, it was the red cardigan in particular, which is a Rogers signature, that saw the highest spike in popularity—purchases have increased 104%, reports Poshmark. Why the cardigan, and why right now? Well, first of all, Halloween! It’s unfortunately easy to see “Sexy Mr. Rogers” having swept the sick heart of our twisted nation this season. But the cardigan is also one of fashion’s most complicated garments: standing, as it does, for morality, decency, and modestly, it’s rife for reinterpretation and subversion. The cardigan is the most delicate and sensitive of knits; part of its appeal in the vast universe of Cobain artifacts is the feeling that it is a synecdoche for all of Cobain’s existential dissatisfaction with the corporate pop music machine and the macho Nirvana fans he felt misunderstood the band. You just look at the garment and see Cobain hunched over, the mopey cape hanging tragically off his bony shoulders. And because the cardigan is so symbolic, it’s disarmingly simple for it to stand for precisely the opposite idea, too. Logan Roy, the Succession patriarch and the world’s oldest living human bottle of Balvenie scotch, does his evil deeds in an elaborate shawl-collar cardigan that looks as soft as Roy is not. You may not want to be Roy, and none of us can be Cobain (even if we own the musician’s sweater, though maybe don’t do that—the previous owner told Rolling Stone he was selling it because he couldn’t handle the pressure of possessing the garment). But I guess we can be Mr. Rogers, sexy or not! Yes: anyone can come home after a long day’s work, gingerly remove their work clothing, and dress down in a cardigan and sneakers. (And then order like $60 of sushi on Seamless and drink half a bottle of wine and Instagram it with the caption “#UGH #CAPITALISM”!!!) Do people want to be Mr. Rogers? I suppose we will find out when the film is finally released on November 22, 2019. (Crewneck lovers: viewer discretion is advised.) This isn’t all we have to learn about cardigans today, however. It’s time to yank down the proverbial projector screen and take out my pointer rod so we can have a long, serious chat about the heart and soul of America(...’s sweaters). As you can see from the Poshmark infomap above, America is radically divided when it comes to sweater brand preferences. The northeastern United States is demonstrating a distinct preference for cardigans by rag & bone—tasteful, but perplexingly elitist according to the rest of the WORLD. The midwest is drawn to the je ne sais quoi of Lacoste cardigans, which are the platonic ideal of a varsity style, the kind you might proudly wear to a pep rally or cry in while listening to Weezer (as a one-time resident of Ohio, I assure you that these are the two tentpoles of midwestern high school existence). Meanwhile, the south gravitates towards the romantic Americana stylings of Ralph Lauren’s Polo, a brand whose breadth of cardigan knowledge is so vast that you both Logan Roy and Kurt Cobain could find something to love—mostly because it is obsessed with tradition. Perhaps most surprising is the fact that the western half of the United States is absolutely dominated by an affinity for cardigans by AllSaints, the British steampunk high street brand that sells Rick Owens-y takes on Sienna Miller’s Glastonbury wardrobe. These are sweaters that come drapey and minimalist, for the man who thinks it might be chilly at the Imagine Dragons show tonight. Will America be able to overcome its differences in brand loyalty? Will its grievously divided citizens be able to see the greater commonality of a sweater that wraps around your back and meets in the front with a few buttons that carry a message of coming together, yes, of spiritual unity, of that beautiful only-in-America promise of working towards the greater good of no one seeing your bad T-shirt? That is an existential drama to close 2019. Only 2020 has the answer. Subscribe now and get a FREE weekender bag and the GQ Style Guide.

We should all be paying $15 a month to view and learn from this fit but somehow, miraculously, it is free. Start with the base layer: no one has ever gone wrong beginning an outfit with a white T-shirt. And while the flowing monogrammed Gucci coat will get all the attention here, look closely and you'll see a black red-and-yellow striped cardigan layered smartly underneath. Never forget your mid-layer garment, kids! Everyone needs a Freaky Cardigan in their late-2019 rotation, and Styles found the perfect one that accurately imagines what Mister Rogers would wear if he shopped at SSENSE. Then, yes, of course, the statement coat: made by Gucci and covered in the house's iconic monogram, it relishes in the small details like the label still appended to the cuff. (The price of said coat? $3,500) The last ingredients in this Big Fit of the Day are the flared jeans—denim is back!—and the very casual Vans shoes. The denim newsboy cap on the other hand?

Less discussed is the lost-to-history second half: where there’s Frankie Smokes, there are fire fits. That’s a joke almost as bad as the start of the NBA season for the New York Knicks. But if there’s a single bright spot, it’s been the reemergence of Frank Ntilikina both on and off the court. The rangy French point guard showed up to the arena Sunday wearing Jack Purcell-style shoes and a variety of garments that slid up and down the sizing scale: skinny distressed jeans, a big oversized Balenciaga sweater, and a cross-body bag so small it wouldn’t even fit all the vowels in his last name. His NBA tunnel appearance would be the high point of the night. The Knicks lost so badly to the not-very-good Cleveland Cavaliers that the team president and general manager felt compelled to organize an impromptu joint press conference. On his ESPN radio show today, Stephen A. Smith, screamed-slash-incanted that the Knicks are “straight trash.” He wasn’t talking about Ntilikina’s Big Fit of the Day, though.

      " Subscribe Now Get the Magazine 1 Year for $15 Over the weekend, a Patek Philippe wristwatch sold for $31 million. Why? And what does it all mean? When the bidding for the Patek Philippe Grandmaster Chime reference 6300A reached 18 million Swiss francs, there should have been pandemonium. It is the sort of momentous occasion that warrants a balloon drop, cannons firing confetti, or a Gatorade bath. Instead, over the weekend in Geveva, at the Only Watch auction held in conjunction with the auction house Christie’s, the room was relatively tepid. The milestone was met with scattered applause, a few whistles that floated up from the back of the room from shy catcallers, and Only Watch founder Luc Pettavino, wearing a suit the blue of a perfectly cloudless day, dipped his face into his hands in disbelief. The Patek Philippe had just swiped the crown of most-expensive wristwatch from Paul Newman’s Rolex Daytona, which sold for $17.8 million in the winter of 2017. “I thought there would be more excitement when the auction hit 18 million,” says Eric Wind, a watch dealer who formerly worked for Christie’s and was in the room for this auction, “but people were sort of already expecting that.” The room was packed with men in suits and women dressed in sweaters and scarves, all neatly attired to attend one of the world’s most expensive spectator sports. Rahul Kadakia, behind the rostrum at the front of the room accepting bids and Christie’s international head of jewellery, was hardly content with the result either. After a bid of 18.5 million francs, he looked longingly over at the row of people manning phones connected to the world’s most desirous watch collectors. “Say it!” Kadakia demanded. Everyone laughed, but the woman on the phone obliged. “19 million,” she said while knifing her hand into the air. Another round of applause. The room took on the atmosphere of a Rolling Stones concert that’s entered the encore, the juicy section where Mick and company are only playing the hits. Every hand in the crowd shot up in the air and gripped a phone, every new utterance was greeted with whoops, clapping, and the occasional hushed “wow” shuddered through the crowd. The next milestone came only six minutes into the bidding when a bid for 25 million francs arrived. There was no doubt any longer: the Patek Philippe would be the most expensive timepiece ever sold, breaking the record previously held by a Patek Philippe pocket watch commissioned by the banker Henry Graves in the 1920s that sold for $24.4 million in 2015. Still, the numbers continued to pile up like a Jenga tower—the end was inevitable, but for the time being everyone was having one helluva good time. After a brief pause following the 27 million francs mark, Kadakia chided his suddenly turtled bidder. “He’s changing his story,” he joked. “The numbers are too big now.” But the numbers kept getting bigger anyway: 28 and 29 million came and went. 30 million received a big clap and a woman on the phone raised her hand so casually to announce, like it was the most obvious thing in the world, 31 million. “Ladies and gentlemen,” Kadakia said before finally bringing his hammer down, “once in a lifetime.” The motion made the Patek Philippe Grandmaster Chime the most expensive watch ever sold by a wide margin. It is a stunning result. Unlike the Paul Newman, this watch was not vintage nor powered by incredible provenance. The Grandmaster Chime is a modern watch made specifically for the Only Watch auction, which donates 100 percent of its proceeds to Duchenne muscular dystrophy research. The watch is the most advanced ever produced by Patek Philippe, which is already renowned for making the world’s most advanced wristwatches. The watch comes with 20 complications—think of them like apps for a watch—including minute repeaters that chime out the time, a perpetual calendar, second time zone, moonphase indicator, and dials for the day and date. Plus, the watch is, astoundingly, reversible. On one side, a sleek black dial and on the other a salmon-colored face that’s etched with the words: “The Only One”. “[Patek Philippe president Thierry Stern] told me he had written the mention of ‘The Only One’ to emphasize its uniqueness and that he was sorry he didn’t have the idea before,” Pettavino writes over email. It allegedly took Patek Philippe 10,000 man hours in total to make the watch. “Since the beginning [of Only Watch’s paternship with Patek Philippe,] in 2005 their idea was to go crescendo,” says Pettavino. “And this time, super crescendo!” While the watch is exceptionally complicated, marking the watch as “The Only One” is likely what armed this watch with the sledgehammer to smash previous records. There are many beautiful Patek Philippes collectors can buy, and many highly technical ones, but what makes this particular reference a $31 million watch is its one-of-oneness. “Obviously it's the exclusivity of it,” says Wind. Only Watch isn’t the only winner from this auction, either. Leading up to the auction, people whispered that Patek Philippe was in it for glory. “All the conversations before were that Patek Philippe really wanted to overtake Rolex as the most expensive wristwatch ever sold,” says Wind. “It was very discomforting to them to not have the record for most expensive wristwatch. So from day one they set out to make the watch that could surpass it.” Watch collecting largely will benefit from this ceiling-raising piece, too. The watch community has long wondered why watches weren’t considered as valuable as cars or pieces of art. While this result alone won’t put watches in the same tier as those collectibles, it’s certainly a step in the right direction. “It’s good to see the goalposts getting expanded for the field of watch collecting,” Wind says. In the days leading up to the auction, Wind says opinions were split on the watch’s worth. “A friend of mine who is pretty well tied in with the Asian collectors said that there was a lot of talk it would surpass the [Henry] Graves, which several days ago people were saying would be so outlandish.” Wind laughs at the memory now. Days later, a $31 million wristwatch still elicits that reaction: laughter, or disbelief. “I did not expect this level to be envisageable,” Pettavino says. “It’s so strong I still have difficulties to integrate this amount. Above the Everest and the sky. Somewhere in space…” Subscribe now and get a FREE weekender bag and the GQ Style Guide.

      " Subscribe Now Get the Magazine 1 Year for $15 Classic Rolex pieces bump up against totally unconventional choices in this edition of Watches of the Week. Welcome to Watches of the Week, where we'll track the rarest, wildest, and most covetable watches spotted on celebrities. In 2011, Tyler, the Creator broke into the mainstream with his song “Yonkers,” which starts: “I’m a fucking walking paradox.” The line has served a little like a mission statement for his whole career, and his watch is irrefutable proof that remains true almost a decade later. A famous, incredibly stylish, and wealthy rapper wearing a watch that isn’t flashy, iced-out, from a household luxury brand, or cost hundreds of thousands of dollars—a paradox if I’ve ever seen one. If you want to wear the watch favored by one of our most fashionable rappers, you will only need $11 and some change to buy Tyler’s Casio MQ24-9B, the Honda CR-V of timepieces. Tyler’s Casio cracks open a funny truth about watches: while Tyler could certainly buy a more elegant and lovingly made watch, none would tell him more accurate time than this cheaper-than-a-Sweetgreen-salad Casio. Tyler’s watch contains a tiny quartz crystal inside—rather than the hundreds of gears, springs, and rotors in a mechanical watch—that keeps exponentially more accurate time over the long-term than any mechanical watch can. Still, plenty of gorgeous mechanical watches to discuss this week in the form of classic Rolex models and even one made by Ralph Lauren. Tyler’s watch isn’t sexy or particularly cool and it won’t make a good heirloom to pass down to the next generation, but its practicality is unmatched. Even Bernie Sanders’s watch is 25 times more expensive than Tyler’s. The only logical conclusion to draw from this? Tyler, the Creator should be president. As a fashion choice, the Casio is an interesting choice and an excellent throwback. The watch immediately dredges up memories of the Quartz Crisis that decimated the Swiss watch industry in the early ‘70s. The new technology captivated a generation that thought the new, more affordable technology was totally radical. It clearly has the same effect on Tyler. Brown is known for his traditional approach to getting dressed: he favors a well-tailored suit or a Good Boy™ polo over the latest oddity sent down the Balenciaga runway. These preferences spill over to the actor’s watch choices. Before an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Brown wore an extremely classic Rolex Submariner. It truly does not get more iconic than this diver’s watch in stainless steel with a black dial. Most of the green-tinged Rolex watches come with fun whimsical names: the Hulk! The Kermit! No such luck with Rob Lowe’s (still-very-handsome) example released in 2005 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the GMT-Master’s 50th anniversary. In 1955, Rolex made a watch for Pan Am pilots that, with the help of a second hour hand, could tell the time in two different time zones at once. Was the never-aging Rob Lowe alive then, did he pilot a Pan Am flight, did he invent airplanes??? Nothing is certain at this point. Either way, 50 years after debuting the first GMT, Rolex released this pretty edition with a green-dial that I propose we finally give a cool nickname. Maybe it’s the “John Deere” or, like, “The Luck of the Irish.” Over the course of horology history, Cartier has created some of the most original and innovative timepieces. The Tank was inspired by an overhead view of an actual tank, the Dali-like Crash was modeled after a watch that allegedly melted in the burning rubble of a car wreck, and the original Santos holds the title of first-ever wristwatch after a Brazilian pilot asked his buddy Louis Cartier to hook him up. (That’s a serious plug!) If there’s been one knock on Cartier over the years, it’s that many of its watches use quartz—there’s that word again—movements instead of mechanical ones. Meek Mill’s skeletonized dial, which lays bare the movement inside, puts any doubts to rest. Plus, well, it looks really cool. Over the months, we’ve covered a gamut of pieces here on Watches of the Week but every iteration still manages to surprise me :’). We’re accustomed to the Rolex, Patek Philippe, Richard Mille, and Omega watches, but never before have I spotted a piece by the iconic American designer Ralph Lauren, who is better known for his inventions in the apparel world. Scorsese’s doesn’t come with the watch cred inherent with those other brands, but RL actually makes some pretty serious timepieces: ones that resemble horse stirrups and others that feature the world’s best dressed bear. According to Ralph Lauren, the design of this watch is inspired by the dashboard on the designer’s 1938 Bugatti Type 57SC Atlantic Coupe Martin. It must be so cool to be rich. While attending a Los Angeles Clippers game, Adam Devine wore a watch that doesn’t need to be load managed. Actually, the Omega Speedmaster’s whole deal is that it’s one of the toughest keep-on-ticking-no-matter-what timepieces in the whole watch industry. The piece’s claim to fame is that it’s the only watch in history to pass NASA’s battery of tests and be cleared to accompany astronauts on missions to the moon. It was there on Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong’s wrists when the pair touched down on the moon in 1969. I’d like to see Kawhi Leonard do that.

The tie is skinny and black. The shoes are shiny and black. No, those aren’t the opening lines to a terrible lost punk album that some guy on Reddit says is super good. It’s a list of the little things that make Willem Dafoe’s suit SPARKLE. Can you hear the sartorial windchimes??? See, in this world of micro-ponchos and motorcycle jerkins paired with matching fringe bikini trousers, sometimes it’s refreshing to see a guy in a regular-ass suit. The blue one that Dafoe wore on Thursday night to the at the SAG-AFTRA Foundation's 4th Annual Patron of The Artists Awards at Wallis Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts—hold on a sec, we’re out of breath—might look kinda regular, but like Dafoe himself, has a few little tweaks that make it something special. These are the kinds of things that make a go-to suit a joy to put on over and over again, without making it so WILD that your friends and loved ones will say, “Oh, that again” (and not only because this is your third wedding in as many years).

      " Subscribe Now Get the Magazine 1 Year for $15 The partnership is “a new collaborative journey.” After yesterday, when Adidas teased a collaboration with Prada on social media with an image of two Adidas shoeboxes slipped into Prada’s embossed shopping bag, the Italian luxury house and Europe’s largest sportswear manufacturer have today offered more details about the project, including its scope and release dates for the first “iteration.” As Prada has resisted the collaboration fever that has hit other luxury brands, the Adidas partnership marks a historic moment for both brands. While no further images have been offered, the release states that the collaboration will rely on the “rich legacies of both to re-engineer timeless icons,” meaning we’ll likely see the signatures of both brands—Prada’s interest in the ugly or overlooked, plus vernacular shapes and garments that work almost like pictograms subverted into luxury fashion; Adidas’s almost midcentury modern, rounded silhouette and three-stripe motif—merged into one. Prada has long been an industry leader in the fusion of technical clothing and luxury, with their Linea Rossa line, launched in 1997, a precedent for the kind of athletic-inspired apparel that would become the European runway standard two decades later. (They shuttered the line in the late 2000s and relaunched it in 2018.) It’s a brand that loves to undermine what we don’t think we want to see and make us want it. Adidas, of course, has made its mark in the world of high fashion with Kanye West’s Yeezy, as well as via former Celine designer Phoebe Philo’s adoration for the Stan Smith, which set off a street-style craze for the shoe in the mid-2000s. The release states that the first delivery of the collaboration will be two Prada for Adidas shoes “that draw on the rich patrimony and iconography of both labels,” and will be available in December 2019. The shoes will be manufactured by Prada in their Italian factory. The project is referred to as “a new collaborative journey,” meaning much more is likely to come from the partnership.

      " Subscribe Now Get the Magazine 1 Year for $15 On the Uncle Fester of Savile Row and the right’s sartorial choices. Each day this week, Roger Stone walked into a federal courthouse in Washington, D.C., like he was modeling the latest antique styles from a long-shuttered bespoke tailor called something like Wiggy & Cheats. He wore his signature round Cutler and Gross sunglasses, which make him look like the guy you stay away from at a Steampunk rave, and sculpted his white hair into a villainous white combover. And as I looked at photos of him waving and grinning his way into the courtroom, where he is on trial for lying to the government and witness tampering, I kept wondering something. Why is the far right so into clothes? And why are they so bad? Stone loves clothes. Just this week, his outfits read like the diary of a man who gets high on the tailoring equivalent of something you are not meant to smoke: Monday: a black, black suit with a white shirt and a knit tie, with a pair of black boots. Tuesday: a gray suit, with pocket flaps on the jacket and pleat-front trousers, and a pink dress shirt. Wednesday: a deep charcoal suit with a spread-collar blue striped dress shirt and a white-and-navy striped tie. Thursday: a Prince of Wales check suit (the kind of thing that photographs horribly) with a blue spread-collar dress shirt and a black tie. Each outfit has been accented with a pocket square that looks like he took the white flag of surrender, dyed it some sad, odd color like a criminal disguising himself on the run, and starched it back into obstinacy. He looked like the Uncle Fester of Savile Row: Put a lightbulb (or an incriminating document) in his mouth, and he can make it light up. Stone clearly loves the rules, the prestige, and the exclusivity of bespoke clothing. Spread collars, pocket squares, and pleat-front trousers aren’t things you see even at white-shoe law firms or on Wall Street anymore; in the United States, this kind of natty, by-the-obscure-European-books dressing is now an eccentricity. He even gets his jackets made with three-roll-two buttons, where the top button is placed under the lapel and never used—the kind of tailored menswear-head detail that guys mostly get just to flex their arcane knowledge (or to try in vain to look like James Bond). Nonetheless, these looks have been somewhat subdued even for Stone, who’s worn everything from a black beret and leather jacket to a top hat and full morning dress—attire that’s so difficult to get anywhere beyond the confines of Savile Row that you’d almost consider it a costume. Stone’s obsessive dedication to the sartorially garish certainly makes it seem that way—costumey. Perhaps the new, muted style of Stone is a sign of humility after he was barred from using social media by the judge in July of this year—an event to which he wore a double-breasted seersucker suit, like he was there to hand out ice cream. But this is also a part of a sartorial strategy. In January of this year, he created a video guide for the Daily Caller on how to dress for your (read: his) arraignment, saying, “You have to think long and hard about what you’re going to wear for your arraignment.” Probably only Anna Sorokin, the SoHo grifter who used a celebrity stylist as her courtroom-wardrobe consultant, could take that with all the sincerity Stone intended. He says he chose not to wear a double-breasted suit because you should never dress above the voter—and besides, you can’t do the Nixon victory-V in a DB. So single-breasted it is! He mentions that his Richard James suit, which appears to be the same one he wore Monday, is some 30 years old, his voice motoring on in a haughty gravel. For Stone, the elitism and the obsolete character of tailoring is a fetish. He gives obsoletism a double meaning. Stone isn’t the only fashion despot on the right. On Wednesday, he spent his lunch break with two other fashion fanatics: Milo Yiannopoulos, the bottle-blond high school villain who also loves dubiously tailored clothing, and Gavin McInnes, who is so invested in his “look” that he is almost indistinguishable from a circa-2007 Williamsburg barista who specializes in something moronic like penis latte art. (Admittedly, that’s not far off from his actual origin story.) For Yiannopoulos and McInnes, even more so than Stone, a dedication to style has never been done in such bad faith. They look like Macklemore backup dancers. McInnes, of course, is the leader of the Proud Boys, a group that the Daily Beast recently called Stone’s “personal army,” and another alt-right group with a misplaced passion for fashion. They’ve made Fred Perry polo shirts an almost official uniform, to the brand’s understandable torment, although the polo’s association with right-wing politics dates back at least 50 years. The Guardian recently wrote that the far right loves Fred Perry because “mainstream fashion is the new camouflage,” a way to normalize their radicalism—but the mainstream American guy isn’t wearing his polos with too-tight chinos or whiskered jeans, or at least hasn’t been since Bruce Weber was shooting Abercrombie catalogs. Fred Perry is a country-club brand, and these aren’t men who skipped playing the back nine to go harass journalists in their homes. These are men who want to revert to an earlier way of being, even if that was only ten years ago. As with Stone, their way of dressing is an insistence on playing by old rules. What all these looks share is a maniacal devotion to an imagined Anglo-Saxon culture as expressed through style. Of course, even the most ardent tailoring or menswear fan will tell you that there isn’t really a “right” way to do anything—the joy of bespoke tailoring is its personalization, its room for personality quirks and subtle expressions of individuality. But when it comes to the clothing of the far right, it seems that the more rules you know, the more protocol you pull out from the footnotes of the handbook, the more superior you are. “I know how to win, but it ain’t pretty,” Stone allegedly e-mailed to Bannon—who, you might recall, is an enthusiast of British Barbour jackets—in the summer of 2016. The ugly truths are now evident to anyone who looks. A well-made suit can only hide so much. Subscribe now and get a FREE weekender bag and the GQ Style Guide.

      " Subscribe Now Get the Magazine 1 Year for $15 With 127K Instagram followers and a newly published poetry book, the 22-year-old Brit is a perfect It Boy for our troubled times. On a sunny Saturday afternoon last month, the model Sonny Hall was sitting at a big table in the back of Lucien, a scene-y French bistro in downtown Manhattan. About twenty copies of his poetry book, The Blues Comes With Good News, were stacked in front of him on the white paper tablecloth. The book had just been picked up by London’s Hodder & Stoughton—“Steven King’s publisher,” he noted, grinning—and he was trying to offload the last of the first editions he had self published in April, for $60 a pop. Hall had announced the impromptu book signing last-minute on Instagram, and soon a group of assorted fashion types, literary college students, and absolutely besotted teenage girls hovered around the table. One man, who appeared to be on the front end of the millennial age spectrum, which made him the oldest person in the room by about a decade, summed up how many of them had found themselves there: “It was through social media. I guess Sonny was in my feed.” He asked Hall for a photo. “I was like, there are still young poets out in the world?” Hall moves through life with an exceptionally carefree attitude, and dresses downright Dickensian, wearing slept-in Savile Row suits over wool vests, wingtips with holes worn through the soles, and assorted newsboy caps. He’s covered in spindly tattoos and antique gold jewelry, and holds a deep reverence for Pete Doherty and the Artful Dodger. (He is almost comically British.) He smokes cigarettes constantly, as if from an alternate universe where Juuls never existed. Hall will tell you that he wasn’t always this light on his feet. Blues emerged from a diary the now-22-year-old started keeping in rehab a few years ago. It’s an unflinching confessional, containing 109 skeletal poems that confront addiction, death, heartbreak, and recovery. Most people who grow up being told they are beautiful carry a certain amount of nonchalance, but Hall’s bearing is that of a man who landed unscathed after being ejected from a car crash, and who fully embraces their sheer good luck for having done so. At Lucien—name-dropped in one of his poems—Hall greeted each attendee with a kiss on the cheek and questions about their lives, each his new “matey” or “bruvva.” The day before, when he was getting his photo taken behind the triumphal arch of the Manhattan Bridge, he hopped up on a railing that curved above the roadway of trucks zooming into Manhattan, and tiptoed across the precarious expanse for so long that I found myself wondering what I would tell his agent, Kate Moss (yes, that Kate Moss), if he fell. Hall is circumspect when discussing the addiction problems that landed him in rehab at 18. But he has always been open about the event that spun him out of control and, in a tragic and perverse way, gave him his new lease on life. Hall was adopted at the age of four, but maintained contact with his biological mother. When he was 17, she died of a heroin overdose. Hall, who had dropped out of fashion school in London the year before, threw himself into “oblivion, just 24/7 oblivion,” he recalled. He had been scouted as a model at that point, but couldn’t book jobs because nobody trusted him to show up to set sober. “It wasn’t a party life,” he said. “It was a torturous, dark existence. More and more, I knew where I was going to end up.” Before that day occurred, a family friend called him out of the blue. It was morning, and Hall, who was on his way to the pub, figured he had nothing better to do than take her up on an offer of a rehab retreat in Thailand. In rehab, Hall discovered the collected journals of Pete Doherty, the infamously-unrepentant addict and Libertines frontman who had become his kindred spirit of sorts. “Pete, as a writer, was the first where when I read anything he said, I connected with it, because he’s English and he’s got that dandy kind of thing,” Hall said. Upon returning to London, Hall found that regularly writing helped him cope with the disorienting experience of sobriety, which he said made him “feel like a baby all over again.” “Writing gave me this stepping stone to living and experiencing,” he said, “because everything that I see, feel, hear can go into it. It’s already rationalized. It makes life something that is worth feeling, because I know that I can create from it.” If our insatiable hunger for beauty in the nineties and aughts saw the rise of the model-turned-actor, the bottomless pit of content that defines 2019 has given us the multihyphenate model-poet. Hall himself began posting photos of brooding verses scribbled into battered notebooks to Instagram in late 2017. “When I first put it out, I was fucking scared,” he said. “I was shittin’ myself.” But the initial response was encouraging—positive, even. Hall began leaning into the literary bent, posting photos of himself reading books and writing in his journal, videos where he smokes cigarettes and reads his poems. Those videos are now among his most-liked posts ever. And not just because people love hot guys reading poetry. In the literary tradition of fellow Thai rehab alum and Doherty superfan Cat Marnell, Hall’s work is radically honest, darkly glamorous, and devourable as a result. One poem, “Parisian Lube,” is about Hall going full Lily Allen at Le Select in Paris. Others details illicit affairs with married women and drugged-out sexual encounters with past paramours. You can sense Hall’s outsider status (and seemingly boundless confidence) on the page—many of Hall’s poems went straight from scribbles in his notebook, to Instagram, to the printing press. He readily admits that he doesn’t particularly care what iambic pentameter is, and hardly knew what a stanza was when he began putting pen to paper. The crowd at Lucien could not have cared less. “His whole aesthetic is very authentic and genuine,” said a Hofstra senior waiting to meet Hall. “I just feel like a lot of writers nowadays are very caged, and I feel like Sonny doesn’t have a filter. Which is what I'm very attracted to. It’s very real.” “It’s almost like a guilt that I have,” Hall said, when I asked him about how he encountered the gate of the literary establishment and cut right through it. “I don’t know. I honestly don’t know how things work. I've only been writing for two years and all of a sudden this has happened. I feel guilty because there are so many great writers out there. But maybe down the line I could help in some way, give more people a voice.” Over lunch at a nearby Chinatown cafe, the conversation turns to the family Hall has left, and his adoptive parents’ reaction to the bloodier details of his life exposed in his work. “They've given up now,” Hall replied, “but my mum and dad used to ask: when are you going to write a happy poem? At first I let that frustrate me, because I actually couldn’t. For me, sadness is so much within my work. When I’m happy, I’m just happy, there’s nothing to really say.” Literary success aside, Hall has plenty of reasons to be happy. Soon after getting out of rehab, he starred in Christopher Bailey’s final Burberry campaign alongside Adwoa Aboah, then landed a role as Rita Ora’s paramour in her Let You Love Me music video, appeared on a few magazine covers, and got signed to Moss’s agency—a stamp of approval that means a Sonny Hall billboard is inevitably coming to a town near you. With 127K followers and counting, Hall isn’t above using Instagram to sell books. It’s how he blew through 1,500 copies of the first edition in 6 months’ time. But he is too cool to abide by the Instagram Poet label. “Instagram is the one thing I really try to shy away from when I’m trying to evolve and grow, which is all the time. I’m present. I never get inspiration from Instagram,” he said. “Unless I’m slandering people,” he added. When I mentioned Rupi Kaur, the 25-year-old sensation whose gnomic Instagram poems have turned her into one of the best-selling poets of all time, Hall quickly cut me off. “I would rather top myself,” he said.

      " Subscribe Now Get the Magazine 1 Year for $15 Tyler, the Creator and A$AP Rocky combine for not one, but two #BigFitsoftheDay.  Yesterday, we introduced you to the concept of the mythical and long-rumored but never-actually-seen-before Second Fit™. That's now in the history books after Kristen Stewart made us say, wow, WOW!!! twice in the span of a couple hours. (Thank the Fit Gods for the Charlie's Angels press tour.)  Today, we have something similar but distinct in its own way: two Big Fits, without a doubt, but worn side-by-side rather than by the same individual. If Kristen Stewart's Second Fit™ is \"a kind of fashion equivalent to Taco Bell's Fourth Meal,\" as we described it yesterday, this is like fashion's Nachos BellGrande®. Different composition, but one that yields the same jaw-dropping effect. A$AP Rocky, devilishly drooping his sunglasses, is wearing tailoring on top and nicely worn-in jeans on the bottom. On his feet are Rick Owens's unmistakeable Ramones sneakers. By itself, that is Big-Fit-of-the-Day worthy, but we're treated here to a second helping of Big Fitdom. Tyler, the Creator wears a double-breasted Noah suit over a creamy white v-neck sweater and a hat that assures us he's read Catcher in the Rye. Happy for him! Honestly, it is a blessing to find one fit of this magnitude in a day, so finding two of them in the same photo—right next to one another!—is a freaking miracle.

      " Subscribe Now Get the Magazine 1 Year for $15 Check out the Nike Air Max 95 Lux. Season after season, Supreme and Nike join forces to release some of the most covetable kicks in the game. The New York streetwear label often digs deep into the Swoosh’s archive and thrusts a previously overlooked silhouette into the sneaker stratosphere. Recent collections have rendered a cult-loved indoor soccer shoe, a flame-covered dad sneaker, and a bejeweled aughts-era skate shoe, just to name a few. This week, Supreme and Nike have teamed up on an ultra-luxe version of the Air Max 95, elevating and dressing up the classic shoe into something of a high-fashion sneaker. Made in Italy exclusively for Supreme, the collaborative sneaker features an Italian leather upper with laser perforated logo side panel and gets the full leather lining treatment. Other high-end details include custom leather insoles with gold lettering pressed into the heel and glossy metal hang tags. The Air Max 95 is a curious choice for a high-end makeover but one that feels very spot-on to a brand like Supreme. Nike ACG designer Sergio Lozano was tapped to bring a fresh (and outdoorsy) perspective to the Air Max series. The distinctly rippled running sneaker would make its debut in the mid-1990s to little fanfare. While the sneaker never became an ultra-popular running shoe as intended, it was embraced by sneakerhead and hip-hop communities alike. The Supreme x Nike Air Max 95 Lux will be offered in three colors: shiny black, cherry red, and royal blue. It’s worth noting that all these upmarket details come with a price tag to match; the sneaker will retail for $500, making it the most expensive Supreme x Nike sneaker ever released in the duo’s long history of working together. That said, the limited-edition kicks have all the signs of being a hit sneaker, so, you can expect them to be worth every precious penny.

      " Subscribe Now Get the Magazine 1 Year for $15 A few years since we last saw the style, they're all of a sudden covetable again. Remember the sock sneaker? Just two short years ago, the ultra-cozy kicks were everywhere, second in hype only to the massive ugly-on-purpose sneakers that still dominate the space to this day. And for a good reason: the one-two combo of a cozy knit upper and hyper-sleek silhouette was a surefire way to add a degree of advanced style to any outfit. Of course, in recent seasons, the fervor for the sock sneaker has slowed down—after the Triple S, Balenciaga's second-biggest shoe is its gnarly off-road shoe, not its sock. However, Alyx, the high-end label best known for playing outside the menswear box (and that Kanye West-approved chest rig), has just released its ultra-luxurious take on the style—and it was certainly worth the wait. This is just the latest in red-hot footwear to come from Alyx. Recently, the brand has released everything from a dressy lace-up derby shoe with an exaggerated hiking outsole to a maximalist camo sneaker produced in collaboration with Nike. (Let’s just say Alyx designer Matthew Williams has the range.) This designer sock sneaker features a dreamy palette of whites and greys, with a few contrasting pops of darker shades. The elongated knit upper wraps snuggly up the ankle, and the futuristic silhouette sits on top of one serious treaded sole. While the cozy sleekness feels reminiscent of the sock sneaker explosion from a couple of years back, the pumped-up sole adds a spark of utilitarian newness and technical edge to the style. It was sharp of Williams and Alyx to wait for sock sneaker madness to die down before unleashing these on the world. Back then, there were so many high-profile version of the style: the Vetements x Reebok Sock Runner,  Balenciaga’s Speed Trainer, and the Adidas x Gosha Rubchinskiy Ace 16, to name a few. These might have risked getting lost in the mix. However, the boom having slowed down, this sneaker from Alyx cuts through the noise, and the addition of the trek-like sole makes it feel as fresh as any other cutting-edge sneaker that has dropped this year.

      " Subscribe Now Get the Magazine 1 Year for $15 Check out the Nike Air Max 95 Lux. Season after season, Supreme and Nike join forces to release some of the most covetable kicks in the game. The New York streetwear label often digs deep into the Swoosh’s archive and thrusts a previously overlooked silhouette into the sneaker stratosphere. Recent collections have rendered a cult-loved indoor soccer shoe, a flame-covered dad sneaker, and a bejeweled aughts-era skate shoe, just to name a few. This week, Supreme and Nike have teamed up on an ultra-luxe version of the Air Max 95, elevating and dressing up the classic shoe into something of a high-fashion sneaker. Made in Italy exclusively for Supreme, the collaborative sneaker features an Italian leather upper with laser perforated logo side panel and gets the full leather lining treatment. Other high-end details include custom leather insoles with gold lettering pressed into the heel and glossy metal hang tags. The Air Max 95 is a curious choice for a high-end makeover but one that feels very spot-on to a brand like Supreme. Nike ACG designer Sergio Lozano was tapped to bring a fresh (and outdoorsy) perspective to the Air Max series. The distinctly rippled running sneaker would make its debut in the mid-1990s to little fanfare. While the sneaker never became an ultra-popular running shoe as intended, it was embraced by sneakerhead and hip-hop communities alike. The Supreme x Nike Air Max 95 Lux will be offered in three colors: shiny black, cherry red, and royal blue. It’s worth noting that all these upmarket details come with a price tag to match; the sneaker will retail for $500, making it the most expensive Supreme x Nike sneaker ever released in the duo’s long history of working together. That said, the limited-edition kicks have all the signs of being a hit sneaker, so, you can expect them to be worth every precious penny.

      " Subscribe Now Get the Magazine 1 Year for $15 Russ Bengtson explores the joys of being basic. When you’re “a sneaker guy” there are a certain set of questions you will inevitably be asked over and over again. How many pairs do you own? Can you get me a pair of *fill in impossible to get sneaker name here*? What are your top five favorite sneakers? If you could only wear one pair of sneakers for the rest of your life, what would it be? Over time, you come up with ready answers to all of these. In order: “Between 500 and 1,000,” “No,” and “I have no idea.” The last one, though, is the toughest. Over the years it’s changed, from the Air Jordan III to the Air Jordan 1 to the Stan Smith. But if you asked me right now, I’d probably say the adidas Campus. Because, these days, that answer seems more correct than all the rest. The Air Jordan III was a young man’s answer, more about the impact of its design and style than its long-term wearability. The Stan Smith is too white (not you Stan, the shoe), and the Air Jordan 1 is a bit too attention-grabbing to pair with anything outside of the basics. (I guess you could wear an all-black pair, but...why?) The Campus on the other hand, is the Goldilocks principle in sneaker form: for me, for now, it’s just right. That’s true for plenty of reasons—some obvious, some leaning toward the metaphysical. Sure, the Campus is right in that wearability sweet spot—not as slim as the Gazelle, not as chunky as the Superstar—and has been produced in any number of colors and materials over the years. It even has impeccable on-court pedigree, as its Greenstar predecessor was worn by Bill Russell and his ‘69 Celtics teammates. Later, it enjoyed a revival on the feet of the Beastie Boys, who did for the Campus what Run DMC did for the Superstar. About that: want to feel old? It’s been 27 years since two-thirds of the Beasties wore Campuses on the cover of 1992’s Check Your Head. At that time it had only been 23 years since Russell and the Celtics wore Greenstars en route to toppling Wilt Chamberlain and his Los Angeles Lakers, their 11th title in 13 seasons. Two generations of nostalgia are baked into the shoe—and when I pull a pair on, I feel some of that. Or, even stranger, a sort of nostalgia for nostalgia itself. Think about sneakers in 1992. The timeline was still straight: retro editions didn’t exist. If you wanted an older model, you had to dig. Deadstock literally meant dead stock: obsolete shoes that were all but unsellable gathering dust in some sporting goods store back room or basement. Two years later, when Nike re-issued the first three Air Jordans, nobody cared. Why would anyone want old sneakers? Most of them wound up on clearance tables, marked down to $25 or less. So when the Beastie Boys wore sneakers like the adidas Campus and the Puma Suede/Clyde in the early ‘90s, it actually meant something. These weren’t shoes sent by a publicist, or a collaboration worked up between the brand and the group. If you wanted those specific shoes, you literally had to get your hands dirty—or at least someone did. By the mid ‘90s, the brands caught up. That first Jordan retro release didn’t make noise, but as simpler sneakers came back into style, the classics got a second wind. I got my professional start in the sneaker world right when all of this was happening. What was once linear became a criss-crossing series of lines that saw the newest models jostling for shelf space (and consumer dollars) with proven hits from the past, as well as little-remembered models revived for inscrutable reasons. A trip to the local sneaker spot became a little like listening to Paul’s Boutique: something new deeply cut through with references from the past. Instead of a simple hierarchy, where you lusted after whatever the most expensive new models were (there was no need to refer to an Air Jordan by number when it was simply theAir Jordan), now shelves were dense with sneakers from every era. The rise of sneaker boutiques and collaborations stirred things even more. More releases, more references, more mixing of old and new. To stay on the crest of the sneaker wave you had to either have bottomless pockets and a long list of worldwide connects—or actually be part of the industry. I was in the latter group: I went from wishing I could have the newest stuff to stopping wearing pairs when they released at retail. One of my fondest sneaker memories from that era was walking into The Athlete’s Foot on the Upper East Side wearing royal Nike Foamposite Ones a full six months before they came out. No one even knew what they were. Over the years, though, riding the wave got tiring. If this sounds like sour grapes, maybe it is. But staying current is a full-time job. If I was going to NBA All-Star, I’d pack a whole separate bag with shoes, aware of the fact that a) I’d be seeing reps from every brand and wanted to be respectful, and b) there was no way I’d be seen on consecutive days wearing the same shoes. And this was before Instagram! Sometimes I was even more respectful than I even needed to be—back in 2002 in DC, a representative from a brand I won’t name saw me wearing a pair of his brand’s basketball shoes that he himself had sent me and looked up at me incredulously: “You actually wore those?” Sometimes I look at sneakers the way Mickey Mouse looked at the brooms in The Sorcerer’s Apprentice. We only had so much, so we wished for more. And at first more was good, but then more became even more, and more, and more, and finally too much, and by then there was no way to stop it. I look at the way things are now—blogs posting “The 25 Best Sneakers Releasing This Weekend and How to Buy Them”—and wonder whether there’s even a sorcerer out there who can save us from ourselves. I can’t save you. I don’t even know whether I can save myself: I still get caught up in new releases, still log onto the SNKRS app to get a series of error messages before tossing my phone aside. But in the meantime, I’ve been trying to do something different: is take one of the thousands of “you can wear these every day!” sneakers and doing exactly that. And for now, that’s the adidas Campus. But that doesn’t mean I’m all the way out on sneaker nonsense. There are the basic models, yes—the navy and maroon pairs I got earlier this year—but there are also the Stock X IPO joints that just hit—or, if you wanna dig really deep, the Foot Patrol B-Side joints that I named sneaker of the year back in 2011. I recently dug mine out of storage and, yeah, I still agree with 2011 me. But no matter the version I’m wearing, I feel like I’m tapping into something a little deeper. I keep going back to the Beastie Boys and 1992 and Check Your Head, the jacket alone which is a cross-genre time capsule of legendary shit—Glen E. Friedman photo, Eric Haze handstyle, and of course the Beasties themselves. But all of that was secondary stuff, because what really mattered was inside—what you heard when the needle dropped into the groove. The Beastie Boys didn’t do all this shit to get noticed, they did it because it they thought it was dope. If other people agreed, that was a bonus. They didn’t wear Campuses because they were cool—they made the Campus cool by wearing them. In an era where people increasingly want their sneakers to speak for them, I find myself wondering what exactly it is that we’re trying to say. So while my whole Campus thing might seem like simply choosing one sneaker over many, I’m thinking of it more as trying to recalibrate the balance of sneakers in my life. Because if I meet you for the first time and the first thing you do is check my feet, you’re looking in the wrong direction. Subscribe now and get a FREE weekender bag and the GQ Style Guide.

      " Subscribe Now Get the Magazine 1 Year for $15 From chunky-as-hell cable knits to prim-and-proper cardigans, GQ’s Best Stuff has all the impossibly soft, profoundly warm layers to swaddle yourself in through April. Remember that guy Bryce you couldn't stand in high school? The one who was valedictorian and the star quarterback and the lead in the musical and always really nice to you, which somehow just made you hate him even more? Cashmere is the Bryce of fabrics. It’s the strongest and warmest and softest and swankiest form of wool there is, and it’s here to take your dreary winter wardrobe to bold new heights of handsomeness and coziness. Instead of harboring any deep-seated resentment, though, the real issue you’ll have here is settling on the right cashmere sweater for you—especially given the explosion of reasonably affordable options that's flooded the market in recent years. To help make that decision as simple and streamlined as possible, we found you 14 of the very best men's cashmere sweaters on the planet—from the gigantic flexes worth dropping a paycheck on to the budget-friendly crewnecks you should cop in every color. You'll look even better in them than Bryce did the night he was crowned prom king. Stupid Bryce. You don’t have to do much to men's cashmere sweaters for them to make a big impression. The fabric itself speaks volumes, so even the most basic of sweaters can instantly make an outfit feel a bit luxer, more considered, and altogether elevated. (Just look at how put together guys like David Beckham and Justin Theroux look wearing plain-jane pullovers.) At the same time, though, a little visual flourish never hurt anybody, which is why we love these crewnecks from Todd Snyder: they still let the cashmere do the talking, but the raglan stripes at the shoulders steps things up the subtlest of notches. Most cashmere stuff feels very East Coast prep—all strait-laced and solid-colored—which makes sense, because the East Coast is where it’s cold. Back in 2007, though, L.A. designer Greg Chait flipped that on its head: under the moniker The Elder Statesman, he started making cashmere blankets, then sweaters and ponchos and socks and stuffed animals, with a distinctly Californian vibe. The stuff is all tie dyed and dip dyed, sometimes emblazoned with palm trees or magic mushrooms or the checkerboard from your trusty Vans. The wavy pullovers are the perfect thing for a chilly night on the beach, or for shaking up your cold-weather fits with a reminder that summer is just around the corner. At some point in the last decade or so, a weird thing happened: cashmere, the rarest and most luxurious of wools, became way more accessible. These days, you can find pure cashmere sweaters hovering around the $100 mark in just about every mall chain store—like if you could suddenly cop a Bugatti for the price of a Kia. But not all affordable cashmere sweaters are built equal, and for our money, Everlane's versions are tops: they’re knit from Grade-A Mongolian fibers—less prone to pilling—with reinforced necklines and cuffs for extra durability. Cop a V-neck—they’re back, baby!—and tuck it in to swervy trousers with nothing underneath. Sometimes lost in all the mystique surrounding Brunello Cucinelli—from the 173-acre medieval hamlet in Umbria where he and 800 of his employees live and work in perfect harmony, to the billionaire summits he hosts on occasion—is the fact that guy makes really, really beautiful clothes. Sweaters like this one are the reason he’s long held the crown as the King of Cashmere: the knit work is crisp and immaculate, the fit is snug and luxurious. It’s perfect to the point that upon seeing its near-$3,000 price tag, all you can really do is shrug and mumble, “Checks out.” Some days, when it’s freezing and you’re cranky and maybe a little hungover, you just need to swim in cashmere. You want to be enveloped by the stuff, to have it shield you from the outside world and everyone in it while still making you look really damn good in the process. That’s what this enormous ribbed mock neck from The Row will do for you. It’s cut slouchy and drapey and will swallow you whole, but is exactingly engineered to do so in the most flattering way possible. You almost definitely own a slim black turtleneck, which is elegant and goes great with everything, but a touch too delicate to stand up to any sort of windchill. Maybe you’ve got one of those chunky Irish fisherman numbers, too—it’s rugged and handsome and makes you feel like the commander in Dunkirk, but it’s too warm to wear indoors and about as comfortable as a Brillo pad. Well, fashion Goldilocks, here’s the middle ground to add to your rotation: Michael Kors’ just-right cashmere turtleneck. Substantial enough to keep out the cold, trim enough to fit under a sport coat, softer than the dulcet tones of your favorite ASMR YouTuber.

      " Designer dress shirts are great and all but if you've been holding onto yours long enough that the collar is fraying and the underarms are less than pristine, it doesn't matter if the fabric came from a prestigious Italian mill. A beat up dress shirt makes you look, well, beat up. Refresh your entire stash for a few hundred dollars by shopping these excellent under-$75 options (bonus points if you also nab them on sale). All are cut on the slim side and come in classic colors and patterns that'll help you blend right in with the higher ups. Looking to slip into something a little more comfortable?

      " Subscribe Now Get the Magazine 1 Year for $15 12 buys that will elevate your khakis-and-fleece look. Suits and ties might not be standard work attire anymore, but that doesn’t mean your professional wardrobe needs to turn into a pile of gingham shirts, nondescript fleece vests, and boring chinos. But what is business casual? The answer might surprise you—because anything in that general orbit is only a style death sentence if you let the startup bros and midtown bankers determine the way you wear it. Go against the fleece and embrace these 12 modern-guy office buys and you’ll be dress-code compliant—and ready for whatever you’re got cooking after work, too. A well-fitting button-down shirt is the glue that holds your business casual wardrobe together, and if you need a break from basic oxfords, there’s plenty out there for you right now. Try a camp-collar shirt for relaxed look that still means business. Just save the tropical prints for vacation—a solid color or classic pattern is plenty chill. A few pairs of well-tailored trousers in traditional checks and stripes will keep your work wardrobe sharp without making you feel completely overdressed. Rest assured: if your office is on the slippery slope towards hoodie-land, these will look just as cool with leather jackets and vintage tees too. Not all denim belongs in the business casual-compliant office, but the right buys will go a long way towards making your work wardrobe look less “dorky manager guy” (especially helpful if you are, in fact, a dorky manager guy). Try a uniform-wash denim shirt or trucker jacket with your dressier work clothes. Good-quality sweaters will give you a break from stiff collars, ward off central-air frostbite, and keep you from looking like someone whose go-to drink is a Long Island iced tea. (Not that there's anything wrong with that.) A cashmere turtleneck is always sharp, and try a solid-color crewneck during the warmer months. White, orange, olive: collect them all. No matter what season it is, your choice of outerwear matters. A handsome wool topcoat or suede bomber can elevate your wardrobe basics tremendously, even if you only get to show it off coming to and from the office. (Yep, it’s that good.) What we’re saying is: don’t be the guy in slacks and a utility parka—unless you’re doing it the Balenciaga way, in which case, as you were. A relaxed dress code shouldn’t mean automatically reaching for those navy suede tennis sneakers every day, polished as they are. Conjure your inner Italian style god by investing in a good pair of loafers (or just some OG Weejuns) for a more sophisticated look. Pleated trousers and chinos are back and more flattering than ever with more tailored legs and tapered, cuffed hems so you aren’t drowning in fabric. Flex your in-the-know-ness in front of the slim-cut-chinos crew by wearing your pair with a knit polo in the same color. Pinstripes and other traditional tailoring patterns still have a place in today’s more casual offices, just as long as you aren’t rolling up in a three-piece suit and spats. A pinstripe sweater or pair of drawstring trousers are a great way to bring the motif into the fold without giving off Patrick Bateman energy. There isn't a quieter MVP than a knit polo shirt. Wear yours with simple trousers and loafers or under a your favorite suit on slightly less casual days at the office—like when you’re secretly interviewing somewhere else. Whether it’s a slim-cut suit or separates, having a good-quality head-to-toe black outfit at your disposal can save you when you need to go from work to anywhere slightly edgier. It also just happens to look damn cool, which isn’t a phrase often used when talking about business-casual clothes. By all means, embrace luxe sneakers, Chelsea boots, and loafers at work, but don’t turn your back on lace-ups entirely. A pair of thick-soled derby shoes offers comfort and cool-factor all wrapped into one goes-with-absolutely-everything package. Subscribe now and get a FREE weekender bag and the GQ Style Guide.

      " Subscribe Now Get the Magazine 1 Year for $15 And it’s never not in style. Your office look starts with enough great suits and shirts to get you through the work week. But office style is about more than the staples, and the dress watch you wear to work, like your tie or your favorite pair of shoes, speaks volumes about the kind of dude you are. (We hope you are not the kind of guy who wears a bright-orange G-Shock to work.) A slim, square-face dress watch (particularly with a black leather strap) will go seamlessly with any suit you throw at it and won't look out of place with your off-duty threads, either. But if you're still holding out for a raise, finding the perfect dress watch can feel daunting—or just flat-out depressing. But we're firm believers that you shouldn't have to choose between a watch and your rent. So we did the work for you and found great watches for different income brackets.
