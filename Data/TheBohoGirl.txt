  Hey, Loves!
Hope everyone is doing well. It’s so sad to see summer leaving but we gotta admit that we’re enjoying the last couple of weeks of this awesome season. As we’re approaching fall season, I thought why not post a blog on fall essentials.
I shopped at Veromoda recently and I thought of sharing some must-have items in your closet from their fall collection-
1) Big chunky cardigan
Chose this slouchy cardigan from vero’s new collection and they’ve some other designs as well but I like this one the best.
It’s comfy, casual and Cosy. Tribal print patch at the bottom makes it even more interesting.
2) Burnt orange tshirt dress/ Top
Burnt orange screams fall for me. Chose this top/dress from their store and paired it with the chunky cardigan, a floppy hat, grey booties, a boho bag and voila, I was fall ready.
3) Fedora Hat
Fedora hat adds that fall vibe to that rather simple attire. It’s so cute and comfy. Throw it on and keep your hair loose or make loose braids which looks even more perfect with it.
4) High neck sweater and Black Jeggings
High neck is the way to go this season. I chose this cream coloured one from vero and paired it with some black Jeggings and I was good to go.
5) Sneakers and Boots
Sneakers are not specific to any season but it’s always easy to throw them on when you can’t decide what to wear with your outfit. These white one from vero are perfect and they tie the whole outfit together.
Collecting Booties in different colours has become my recent obsession. Give me any kind of boots and I’m sorted. I’ve even added some thigh high boots and I can’t really wait to try them on this season.
So, I hope you guys like this post and hope it was helpful for you guys.
Don’t forget to tag me in your pictures if you happen to recreate any of these looks.
Until next post,

I love Diwali, I mean the whole vibe, everyone’s in a good mood, sending gifts, shopping and how can I forget Diwali decor. Ahh!! I love it. 
I know I’m super late but I still wanted to post this, might help some of you guys to plan out and rock your Diwali attire.
So I’ll stop rambling right here. Coming to the outfits I’ve shared three different outfits keeping in mind everyone’s choice, some people like it simple and some go full out ( by the way I’m from the going full out .) First outfit             Hands down this outfit has to be my fave. A lot of mishaps happened during this post( #snapchatfam knows) but everything’s well that ends well right?
I styled this black mesh bodysuit which I loveee and I’ve been wearing it literally with everything since the day I got it. I got this one from Asos but you can easily switch it with a black full sleeves top. Paired it with this Biba vibrant printed skirt and a yellow embellished bag which you guys won’t believe I got for only 100â‚?1; from Sarojini nagar. 
Lastly, I added these big statement earrings and made this braided bun. 
Outfit details: 
Skirt: Biba 
Bodysuit: Asos
Earrings: Chandni Chowk 
Bag: Sarojini Nagar  Second outfit           For the second outfit, I styled this printed Palazzo and kurta from W with these gold earrings, a bindi, statement pendant and a boho clutch. 
Outfit Details: 
Palazzo and kurta: W 
Pendant: Aeteedesigns 
Earrings: Mom’s closet 
Clutch: The Hype  Third look              I love this look so much. Fuschia pink colour and silver antique jewellery speaks to me on a different level. This is more boho than the rest. I paired this set from W with oxidised silver antique jewellery and layered them well to create this look. 
Outfit Details: 
Set: W 
Jewellery: The Hype 
Ring: Ajio 
I hope you guys like this post and if you happen to recreate any of these looks, don’t forget to tag me in your pictures. 
A very Happy Diwali to everyone. Have a safe one.

I’m back with another blog post. This one is in collaboration with Pantaloons. As you guys really liked the previous one that I did with them, I thought of sharing something similar with you guys. One thing I really love about Pantaloons is that it offers a wide variety of trendy clothes for every occasion without burning a hole in your pocket.
So, I created three different looks, 1 western, 1 fusion and 1 festive look using some wardrobe staples which you should definitely have in your closet, hope it helps you guys plan out your outfits and add some essentials in your wardrobe. First look I chose all the basic options from Pantaloons brand  like Candies New York, Honey and Annabelle. I kept it basic so that you can easily style them separately as well. A black graphic tee and high waisted shorts is a must in your wardrobe. I paired this black graphic tee with some black high-waisted shorts and to complete the outfit I added this cape which ties the whole look together. Lastly, I added this sling bag and that completes the first look.    Bag: Honey Rs.1399
Cape: Rs.1199
Tee: Rs.499
Shorts: Rs.1199
Second Look
For the second look, I chose fusion as my theme. I love wearing different colours, one can easily jazz up a simple outfit pairing different coloured prints and patterns. I wore this orange and yellow printed full sleeves crop top with a printed blue maxi skirt from Akkriti. I love how vibrant and lively this outfit is. Lastly, I Added these big gold hoop earrings and voila, you get a quirky fusion outfit. I love how these earrings transform the whole look, statement earrings just like this golden one is a must have.      Jacket – Rs 1499
Skirt – Rs 1799 
Third look For the last look I went all traditional for this festive outfit. Nothing can beat an elegant printed Anarkali suit, it’s perfect for festive season or even any formal function. Chose this one from Trishaa which is so flattering on almost all body types. I added a bindi and gold jhumkis and I was all festive ready. Set Rs 2499       NEW YEAR'S OUTFIT WITH VERO MODA!!!

Hey loves,    2017 is almost here! But you know what that means - New Year's Eve parties. With it comes the pressure to dress up and look oh-so-fabulous. So, here are the top trends going on right now and my favourite picks, so that you can look your best to this year's parties.      1. Maxi Dress   Maxi dresses are easy to carry and require little effort. On top of that, they are so in right now. There are various spins to the tradional maxi dress which gives you many options to choose from like lace, ruffles, velvet etc.   http://www.koovs.com/ridress-lace-maxi-dress-88111.html?from=category-655&skuid=365881  http://www.koovs.com/koovs-elastic-waist-wrap-cold-shoulder-maxi-dress-79273.html?from=category-655&skuid=322901   2. Off- Shoulder This has been the year when the Off-Shoulder trend came back and swept everyone. It works perfectly for party dresses as well. There's the tradional off-shoulder along with drop sleeves and cold shoulder for you to pick from.  http://www.koovs.com/catwalk-88-off-shoulder-drop-sleeves-mid-dress-85825.html?from=category-655&skuid=353486  http://www.koovs.com/rare-off-shoulder-neck-detail-midi-85944.html?from=category-655&skuid=353963    http://www.koovs.com/oliv-off-shoulder-textured-midi-dress-76955.html?from=category-655&skuid=311829  http://www.koovs.com/koovs-frill-cold-shoulder-dress-79253.html?from=category-655&skuid=322766  http://www.koovs.com/noble-faith-cold-shoulder-ruffle-skater-dress-83740.html?from=category-655&skuid=343561   3. Sequined Dress Sequined dresses always manage to look fabulous for night time parties. They require little to no accessorising and are very eye-catching.   http://www.koovs.com/girl-in-mind-all-over-sequin-one-shoulder-dress-84988.html?from=category-655&skuid=349707 4.Plunge neck If you're feeling a little daring, then a plunge neck dress is the right choice for you. It bares skin in a classy way, so you can stand out at the party.  http://www.koovs.com/rare-military-plunge-mini-dress-77819.html?from=category-655&skuid=315711  http://www.koovs.com/koovs-plunge-neck-bodycon-midi-dress-79152.html?from=category-655&skuid=322037  http://www.koovs.com/girl-in-mind-intricate-sequin-bodycon-dress-84985.html?from=search-sequin&skuid=349694  http://www.koovs.com/girl-in-mind-sequin-halter-midi-dress-84992.html?from=search-sequin&skuid=349727  http://www.koovs.com/koovs-sequin-bodice-pleat-dress-81947.html?from=search-sequin&skuid=335469   5. Slip Dress Slip Dresses are all the buzz right now. So this New Year's, slip into something flirty and feminine. You can choose to layer it up or wear it as it is.  http://www.koovs.com/koovs-strappy-back-slip-dress-79314.html?from=category-655&skuid=323146  http://www.koovs.com/koovs-cut-out-strappy-slip-dress-79238.html?from=category-655&skuid=322675   6.

Recently Vero Moda launched their Spring-Summer Collection'17. It is all about style and sass. I have always relied on Vero Moda and never has it disappointed me once!
The best part of Vero Moda is that it fits me perfectly and gives me a sense of comfort I seldom find and the stunning designs are just a add on. I Recently created a look from their latest collection and loved it.  I wore denim overalls, they are so in trend these days and totally easy to pull off. To put some summer feels into it, I layered my outfit with a light fabric shrug!  I put on a denim overall with the belt. We often believe that belts are only for jeans or for having a better fit but now, more than ever they are considered as a fashion accessory.  If you're crazy about Vero Moda like me, then rush to the nearest store and welcome the summers with the style like me! 
At last a shout out to MTV flyp for letting us shoot there!  Until next time,

Required fields are marked *   Comment * Name * Email * Website  Enter your email address to subscribe:   Follow that_bohogirl on Snapchat!  Hey everyone! How are you all doing? We're back with another post and this time, it's about one of the most fun times of the year. We all know India has it's own unique season - the wedding season! So I thought we could chat about it, and talk about our favourite places to shop. If you have a close friend or family member getting married, or you're the bride to be, I hope this will be helpful for you! I've also tried to create my perfect wedding look, which is great for wedding guests and brides to be alike! 

Delhi has so many different markets to shop at, and each of these have something unique about them. Depending on what you're looking for, you'll find something perfect for you, in one (or ALL) of these! Defence Colony

A must visit on every bride’s shopping list is the Defence Colony market in South Delhi. From boutiques to multi - storeyed stores and the best known Indian designers, it's all here. You’ll be able to find an outfit for every function, because of the huge variety on display.
If you want to go for simple and elegant classics, Ekaya is a must visit! Luxurious banarasi saris and lehengas in so many different variations, from simple to embellished are available here. Famous bridal designers such as Anju Modi, JJ Valaya, Rohit Bal and Tarun Tahiliani all have stores here, and will be there to help you find the perfect fit; Be it regal sophistication or quirky and experimental.
The market is easily accessible by road, and is just an overhead bridge away from the Lajpat Nagar metro station.

Shahpur Jat

Shahpur Jat has only recently become one of Delhi’s favourite bridal shopping destinations, because of the many new designers who’ve set up shop here. The winding, colourful lanes and vintage feel of this market will create a unique shopping experience for you.

The Fashion Street in Shahpur Jat is where most of the boutiques are, and you’ll probably find a completely unique outfit for yourself in one of the stores, and get some inspiration for your bridesmaid outfits well! 

These boutiques also stock accessories and footwear, so be on the lookout for those as well!
Wearing your outfit with a pair of embellished juttis would be the perfect way to stand out, be comfortable and most importantly, dance all day! If you love this idea, Needle Dust is definitely a store you need to head to.

This market is near Green Park and while you can get there by car, parking might be an issue. So take a cab, or get off at Green Park metro station - the market is about a 20 minute walking distance from here!

South Ex

South Ex is once again, a wedding shopper’s paradise! This market is home to the most famous bridal stores in Delhi - Frontier Raas and Ushnaq Man Moolchand. The market is basically a designer hub, with a huge Ritu Kumar store, and a Pakistan Fashion Design Council outlet if you’re looking for some beautiful shararas with a twist! Apart from these, the multi - designer store Aza, that stocks the best in the business - Anita Dongre, Manish Malhotra, Anamika Khanna, Gaurav Gupta, JJ Valaya and so many more. 
A lot of other famous stores such as Meena Bazaar, Nalli, Heritage and Roop Sarees are based in South Ex market as well. 
From simple suits and saris to heavily embellished gowns and lehengas, whatever you need is here - you just need to explore!

The market is divided into two parts, 1 & 2 which are connected through a foot bridge.
South Extension is again, accessible by road and is about a 2 km distance from INA Metro Station.

Hauz Khas Village

One of the most famous spots in DelhI! Hauz Khas is not just home to the best restaurants and cafes, but is bridal paradise! It’s home to the multi - designer Ogaan, one of the most loved designer outlets in New Delhi. If you love florals and fluid outfits, visit the Anushree Reddy store in this market, and you’re sure to fall in love. 
The USP of this market though, is the many little boutiques scattered all over, so take your time to explore every corner!
The market is accessible by road, parking is convenient. It is also very close to Hauz Khas metro station. 
And finally, coming to the wedding look I put together, here it goes!
          Outfit: Richa Chaudhary (Hauz Khas)

  Hi, 

Your blog appears as though it has potential, adore it. Do love to purchase extraordinary shirts? Need a shirt printed with quotes,funny pictures or basic printed plans? Need a shade of shirt whichever you like? 

Please visit our website at http://bit.ly/shoutopiatees  Killed it luv.. Stunning pics..  Why do you always suggest the collaboration things? It would be much better if you just suggest the trend/style rather than from which brand to shop. And the areas and designers which you mentioned are definitely not for us. Have you seen their prices?? They are way tooooo expensive, try to post stuff which are suitable for all classes of society and not just the riches.   The stores you mentioned all are very expensive? Correct me if I am wrong :)

Recently I had to shop for my sister's wedding. I got the fabrics from Chandni chowk then the stitching + handwork, the cost shot up!
Can you suggest some medium-budget stores where you can get a very good dress but normal occasions.

I hope that everyone’s doing good! I’ve been working a lot this past month – my schedule includes getting up for shoots and then sitting in front of my computer for several hours, editing and doing all that jazz. I’ve recently started my YouTube channel which is why I’m busy most of the time but it’s a good kind of busy you know?
I love working and keeping myself occupied and when you’re working on something you love, time flies by. It’s addictive at times, I know I’m sounding like a nerd but trust me once you find that something which gives you that spark you never want to stop!
I’m constantly learning new editing ways, reading books and what not, so that I can make myself better with each passing day because as they say, the day you stop learning, your failure starts.
Now, coming back to the post, Veromoda recently launched their new collection- Varsity which has owned millions of hearts in Europe already. Now that college is reopening and everyone’s getting ready and shopping to make that perfect first impression on their very first day, I decided to show you guys how you can style this sporty luxe trend without looking like as if you’re going to run a marathon ?
This trend is really easy to pull off and one needs to nail it and maintain that balance so that it looks casual yet presentable at the same time. I picked up this mesh net sheer top and I styled it with basic black denim which most of you must be having in your closet right now. To pretty things up, I paired it with some black boots (you can even go for sneakers, whatever sails your boat) and a pink backpack which is perfect for college and its always easier to carry a backpack to hold all your stuff and the best part is that it is so on trend these days.
Lastly, I added these fake glasses to give that whole nerdy feel to it.
You can always switch things up and give it your own spin.
You can pair joggers with a basic tee or a more structured skirt with some graphic tees and sneakers. Veromoda has a wide variety of pieces to choose from. I also picked up a mesh detailed shirt dress on which I’ll be doing an outfit post soon.
Some key pieces are also – bomber jackets, Joggers, Snapbacks and sneakers.
I would love to see how you recreate this look and what’s your take on this trend.
Until next time,

This year came with a bang and with that bang came Fishnet Stockings.  The New York Fashion Week was filled with this trend, may that be the runway looks or the street style fashion!

The best part about this trend? We absolutely love it. 
I have incorporated these five looks to give you all an idea how to work this trend out!

1.

Gone are the days we wore ripped jeans as to show off some skin. The new look demands something different. Wear your fishnet stockings under your jeans, I guarantee you this is a look which will not disappoint you! This is for people who feel wearing simply the fishet stockings feels a bit too much and hence you could go for an 
Pair the jeans with a basic tee and boots, and you’re good to go!

2. 


Now all of you girls who have flat tummies, you may follow this style. Put on stockings under your jeans completed by a crop-top. Pull the stockings by their elastic so that they go under the crop top! This peek-a-boo style is totally gonna make you stand out!

3. 


Fishnet Socks took over the day when Kendall Jenner posted this picture on Instagram. For people wearing ankle jeans or heels or shoes, fishnet socks are a great way to give an edge over your outfit. They totally bring the shoes into focus and gives a certain sass to it!
Try it out!

4.


Now this is a DIY Fishnet Stocking look. All you need is a pair of scissors and fishnet stockings. Tear it or cut it drom wherever you like but make sure you don't  get too carried away and wear them beneath the shorts for a total basass look! 

5.

One of my most favourite looks, put on fishnet stockings beneath your shorts or under a dress or a long sweater to make your outfit instantly glamourous and stunning, trust me, it will not disappoint you! 

WHERE TO BUY THEM.

I'm pretty sure after this you won't be able to resist this style! Buy these amazing stockings at our website, click on the image!

I felt that falling in love will be a special experience. And very recently I experienced a gesture so unique, so utterly heart-warming, that I decided to share it with everyone.
I was invited for a shoot by POPxo (a community for women’s fashion, beauty and lifestyle needs) on a pleasant summer afternoon in Delhi. I headed to Gandaram Jewellersin Lajpat Nagar for the same and the platinum bands on display were gorgeous. I was even more amazed to find out that one didn’t need to burn a huge hole in their pockets to buy one of those bands. Platinum Love Band collection start Rs 15000/- onwards! Now that was a steal!!
While I was totally looking forward to the shoot, I was also secretly lusting for those bands. Alas! I had to get on with work. And so I got ready for the shoot, put on some of my favourite bands and asked my camera person to get the lighting in place.
As I took my spot, I saw a figure walk in through the door. With all the lights on me, it was hard to spot who it was. He was headed in my direction but then suddenly stopped at the platinum counter. I got on with work and smiled my way through the hour-long shoot. After we were done, I went back to the counter to hand over the platinum bands. To my surprise, I saw my boyfriend perched comfortably on one of the store’s sofas. I did not expect this.
He got up as he spotted me and gave me a warm hug. When I asked him what he was doing there, he simply shrugged and said, “Oh nothing, just remembered it is the exact same day I met you for the first time.” I was pleasantly surprised that he remembered. Slowly but steadily, he drew something out of his pocket. It was a platinum band. No. Way!!!!
He’d bought me one of the pretty platinum bands I’d been admiring earlier. And while he slipped it onto my finger, he said, “This is to celebrate the day I met the most beautiful girl I’ve ever laid eyes on.” My heart skipped a beat and I was trying really hard to contain a wide grin. Was he for real? How lucky am I?
While writing this post, I look back on that day and blush. It is a surprise, an experience I will always remember. Because everything aside, those bands sealed our bond. This was indeed my Platinum Day Of Love.

Watching new designs and the ever so poised models grace the ramp is probably most mesmerising thing to see. I love the sight of seeingweeks and months of thought and hard work finally being paid off on the beautiful ramp. I recently got the amazing opportunity of attending the London Fashion Week and the experience was Oh! So Beautiful. The London fashion week takes place twice a year and London is one of the four big fashion weeks, the rest being Milan, Paris and New York. I had got this opportunity to attend this event with London School of Trends and INIFD Corporate. The city is very vogue and I had a splendid time putting together disparate looks for myself during this week. My first look, when I arrived in this city comprised of a simple orange sweater layered with a leather jacket and I paired this with some straight black pants and loafers. This look was super warm and super easy.  My first day at the fashion week, I wore a neon yellow dress with an overcoat from Made ByCuin. I completed the look with some statement earrings and bag. The ever so stylish white heels led the look to perfection. I wore my hair in a messy bun and I was all set to rock the first day. My next outfit had a strong layering game. I wore a black turtle-neck and I layered it with a green buttoned shirt that I wore in a little fun way. I wore a jacket over which had a pop of orange colour on its inside. My trousers were the highlight of my look with a very catchy print on them. I wore a K neckpiece with my look and kept rest of the styling minimal.  My third day at the fashion week and I decided to go for my oxidised jewellery. I wore a printed shirt with a grey skirt and I carried a blue polka coat on my shoulders. This outfit was curated by Indigene. I wore a heavy silver neckpiece to complete my look. Again, I kept the styling minimal.  Another very interesting look that I did was the velvet pantsuit by Ayushi Agarwal Label and I wore it over a sporty crop top by Uh Oh by Krishna. I accessorized my look with the very fetchinggold earrings from Zara and these super modish shades from Shein.  This outfit was the most exciting one as I thought of bringing a little India to London with it. I wore a pop saree by Uh Oh by Krishna. It is grey in colour with pop prints that made it Oh, so stylish. I wore the saree on a black full sleeved turtle-neck and to add some pop on my face as well, I wore a bottle green lipshade.  The fashion week was amazing and I had a blast there. Now with the fashion week over, Iset out to explore the city. This one day I decided to go a tad monochrome and I wore a pretty brown outfit. I wore a printed dress with stripes and some fun polkas and layered it with a brown fur jacket. I carried a sling and wore the ever-so-classy pair of hoops. A brown belt and some black shoes completed my look.  I also ended up having the most glamourous opportunity of attending a limousine party while in London where I wore a very dazzling outfit. I wore the classic little black dress and a black coat over it. The best part of my outfit was the very sexy pair of black and silver heels from Truffle Collection.  My trip was amazing but alas! It ended. The last day in this amazing city, I wore a comfortable pair of deep yellow trousers and wore a simple white top with it. I wore an adorable lilac jacket from Bershka. I carried an animal print bag and wore some sporty black shoes, again from Bershka, to complete the look.  London fashion week was a very exciting and I had the most spectacular time looking at the gorgeous outfits prepped up for this season. The city was again, a delight and I had so much fun shopping and just wandering the city. This place is sure to have made a soft corner in my heart and with the fashion week over, I am just so excited to take back all the trends with me to India.

When the clock strikes 12, we leave a year behind and enter into a new year, people have two reasons for being happy, reason number one being the New Years and the second one being a more happening- that is the upcoming ‘FASHION WEEK of 2017’.
And so here are the top 10 anticipated trends for 2017.


1. The Stripes.


(Lacoste Runway Look 2017)



(Rosie Assoulin Runway look 2017) Stripes have been long in fashion and seems they are going to rule in 2017 as well. Bright and bold, one cannot go wrong with it and the stripe dresses are perfect for a spring or summery outing.
One might wear a stripe dress or stripe shirts or palazzos, 2017 brings infinite stripe options! 
2. THE FLORALS.

3.THE BRA TOPS.

4. Shades of the ocean.


(DKNY Runway Collection 2017)


(DKNY Runway Collection 2017)

This time black and white was replaced by the vibrant shades of blue. No matter what season it is or what time of day it is, one cannot go wrong with blue! No matter if you choose a hot short navy blue dress or a sky blue blouse with a pair of shorts, blue rules!


5. The Punk Princesses.


(Marc Jacobs Runway Collection 2017)

Seems like pink on pink isn’t a bad option anymore! The future trends of 2017 Spring looks too ‘bright’!  Put on a hot shade of pink for a party, flip your hair and kill the look. What’s more better than including pink in your wardrobe? Pff! As we need reasons to do it!


7. The Bare Shoulders.

It's almost New Years!! 
I thought of sharing an outfit idea with you guys. 
So, While I was shooting at this location, two innocent girls decided to join in. The joy in their eyes and seeing how happy and excited they were to witness the whole shoot process was unreal.
It was something which forced me to think how simple things can make you feel happy in your life. Most of the times,  we are constantly running after something or another, it's like a black hole you keep on filling and still you won't feel satisfied.  What our souls actually need is a deep connection, someone to love and share our thoughts with. So, this year I've decided to keep my phone down and to focus on making a real conversation, a real connection. 
It's very easy with so many options which are only a click away to deviate and get trapped but we need to realise the fact that social media is only a small part of our lives. 
Coming back to the post, I wore this veromoda dress from their new party collection and oh my!! I fell in love with it as soon as I saw it. 
I Really like the fabric and colour. Usually I shy away from wearing reds but this dress made an exception. This off shoulder dress is just perfect to stand out and shine in the crowd. 
I didn't want the dress to compete with any jewellery because it's already a star so I decided to only add these rhinestone studded earrings, which are pretty classic and I always reach out to them when I want to keep things understated yet put together. 
To complete my Cinderella moment, I wore my all time favourite red lace up heels from Steve Madden and I was ready for the party.

In a world where fashion evolves faster than any other thing, I know that happens when trends change and especially in case of a fashion fanatic. I know the struggle of never having enough money to shop or enough clothes to wear. What if I told you there a single solution to this problem? And it only requires a stable net connection!
One word, seven alphabets-  Flyobe, one stop for all of your fashion troubles!

An online portal through which one can rent clothes for a particular number of days. Flyrobe was started by three engineers from IIT Bombay and has gained immense popularity in the past year.
Flyrobe recently opened its first store in Delhi where people could go try out clothes according to their size and rent it if they like it! They are located in Shahpur Jat and have a beautiful collection. Designers like Ritu Kumar, Masaba Gupta, Dheeru and Nikita and various other designers have found a place there. With a variety of designs, I guarantee you will find your perfect outfit there.
Weddings are on their way and as we know, we girls just hate repeating clothes, so how about we let the last wedding season clothes remain in the trunk and try out all the new seasons designs? I don’t know about you, but I’m on my way to do that!
The best part about flyrobe? It’s not limited to girls and hence men out there, you have this option available to you to as well!
Take my advice and check out Flyrobe’s recently opened store in Shahpur Jat and get a new trend starting!

I was all over the place last week, keeping up with work can get a lot sometimes. But I finally found time to sit down and write this post. I was feeling myself in this post, here I went back to old boho routes and selected this cool summery white boho top from Veromoda. Speaking of Veromoda, while I was there I selected few other tops. They have some really cool collection of tops and I picked up a few including this one. I wanted to go all out this time so I selected a asymmetrical ombré skirt and tucked in the top to give the outfit some shape. I added these black mules which I haven’t really worn in a long time ( I don’t why). Lastly, I added some boho elements like this anklet which I wore as an armlet, oxidised earrings, some rings, a black quilted bag pack and this trusty old fedora hat. For hair and makeup, I kept the make up really simple and skipped the eyeliner this time and went with shades of brown mainly, made two fishtail braids and I was ready to go!

Writing this post while I’m waiting for my Starbucks order at the airport. This month has been super super busy, I think I say this with every other month but that’s what life has been lately to me and I’m loving every minute of it.
Coming back to the outfit and different trends, Denim has been one of my favourites. Almost everyone has atleast one pair of denim be it shorts, dress or jeans. I don’t think this trend is going anywhere anytime soon. So I decided to show you guys my take on the whole Denim trend.
Denim dresses are fun to style to. Also,as I’m as huge fan of dresses, you just need one piece of clothing and you’re done ?
Only has some really cool collection of Denims. Boyfriend jeans, mom jeans, denim jackets to dresses. They’ve have a huge variety to choose from. I chose this black denim dress from there. The length as well as fit of it was perfect and above all suitable for different occasions.
I’m into boots a lot lately, so I paired them with some smoking grey ankle length boots and silver detailing sling bag.
To spice things up, I went with a bold lip colour and a lace choker.
I hope you guys like the look.
Until next time,

Hey Loves,  Hope everyone is doing good! This week has been crazy busy. If you follow me on Snapchat you'll know why. Completed almost 6 shoots and one video in 2 days, flew down to Mumbai and came back the same day after walking the ramp with Kangana Ranaut. Now you know why. ðŸ» All I'm thinking about right now is a vacation. Ahh!!! Relaxing for some time without any worries and tasks to check off my list. Hahah don't we all wish for that? But yeah I may or may not be going somewhere next week and I'm super pumped about that. 
But before that, I wanted to write this post. Denim on denim. I'm sure you've heard about this trend plenty of times and it's still going strong this year. Denim is a staple and there are so many different ways to style it.  So, I decided to head over to my nearest ONLY store and I picked up few pieces from their new collection which I should tell you is so good! You'll find everything from patchwork denims, to your staple denim pieces and skinny fit jeans which are so comfy.  I decided to give it my own spin and styled three different looks for every kind of girl out there. If you like street style, glam or nerdy look I've got you covered.  FIRST LOOK :- I styled my patchwork skinny jeans with a black bralette and a light wash denim button down. To add a hint of street style look, I added this bandanna which is actually a headband. Lastly, I paired it with black boots and I was good to go.           SECOND LOOK:- I kept the same patchwork jeans on and paired with a oversized jacket. To add that glam I styled it with this huge rhinestone choker.  Also head to your nearest store and you can get 1 denim at 15% off and 2 at 25% off.  Also, use the code ' BOHODENIMIZE ' for an additional 5% off on only.in!ðŸ‘– along with the above offer Until next time, Xoxo #bohogirlies  Styling Pu Leather Jackets with ONLY!

As Indians, weâ€™re most excited when someone in the family is getting married. We spend hours taking screenshots of what we think is the perfect outfit, and then set out to find the perfect accessories to go with it. And it would probably be exhausting if we didnâ€™t love it so much. 
Since Iâ€™m always trying to put a boho twist to my everyday clothes, I thought, why not to wedding outfits as well? In the first part of this series, Iâ€™ll show you how I put a colourful, gypsy twist to the classic red lehenga.

I picked a bright red lehenga from Param Sahib Clothing for this look. The star of this lehenga was the peplum style top. The top had bits off mirror detailing all over â€“ on the neckline, the belt and the cuffs. At the centre of all the little mirrors, sequins and patterns was a coloured motif of a tiger. And the mirror belt right below it perfectly emphasized the waist, and completed the silhouette of the top. Below this structured silhouette was the flowy, net material which was kept simple with sequined detailing. But my favourite part of the entire outfit were the sleeves! The full length sleeves had random, colourful patterns all over, and all the randomness completely brought the look together. For accessories, I went with chunky, golden jhumkas and a heavy, golden choker, both from Apala by Sumit. They had muted bits of red, green and silver all over them, and I thougt were just meant for the outfit. Since the lehenga was colourful, I wanted to balance the look with my accessories, and these were perfect. The accessories didnâ€™t get overwhelmed by the extravagance of the dress, but completed the look. Another quirky little accessory that was added to the lehenga was bits of feather on theÂ side which perfectly completed the gypsy look that I was going for! And finally make up!Â I kept it minimal and neutral and went with a black smoky eye and nude lips. And after that?! I went on to pose in all the typical Bollywood styles, because thatâ€™s why we wear lehengas, right?!            These Glasses Are Everywhere, And We're Here to Help You Get the Look!

ONLY is here to tug at your nostalgia once again, with a collection featuring one of the most loved Disney characters - Donald Duck! The limited edition collection has some amazing colourful, funky prints and graphic t shirts, to let the Disney fan in you loose. My pick from this collection was this ‘Preposterous!’ Shirt which is basically me, always. The shirt is a classic plaid with a print at the back, and a tie up detail at the sleeves, which is so in trend these days! There are so many possibilities with this top, and I’m so excited to style it in different ways. For this look, I gave a retro look to my outfit with by tying up the shirt and pairing it with comfortable, dark blue cowl jeans. Keeping the outfit simple, I focused on the accessories, and I’m in love with how it looks! Big hoops and a scarf at the waistband to add to the retro look. The finishing touch was some classic black glasses…until inspiration struck again - so I took it a step further with some oversized, red ones to add a pop of colour and bring the whole retro look together. I’m so happy with how this look came together, and I’n excited to add some of my own twists to its and style it for my everyday casuals!

And of course, I have my eye on some of the other products from this collection, which has both vibrant, eye - catching prints and classic blacks…and best of all - they have some comfy lounge pants which, lets face it, is all we wear around the house…why not do it with some Donald Duck prints?! The collection is available both in stores and online, so get shopping, and let me know how you plan to style it!

Hey loves, I honestly can't believe that it's December already! Oh how time flies by. You don't even realise it and before you know it, the year is over... This year, I've had the pleasure of working with 'Only' throughout, and it has been really great. The season of cold is here! With the leaves falling and there being barely any sunshine, nature itself adopts a sort of dull look. But, one should never stop experimenting with fashion. It is time to bring out your sweaters, hats, coats and mufflers, and to face the cold fashionably.  So, I have created this look from Only's new winter collection. Only has created a collection of quality outerwear for the cold season. You can now pick from a plethora of winter clothing like sweaters, jackets, pullovers, sweatshirts and hoodies. With their vast collection of winter wear, they are sure to have a jacket suiting your style. The particular look that I've chosen to go with today is geek chic. The centre of attention of this outfit is the adorable heart patch sweater, which is a part of Only's new winter collection. Not only is this sweater super cute and fashionable, but it's really warm as well and is perfect for the cold winter days. It is also really versatile and can be easily be paired up with a lot of options. I have paired it with a suede skirt. You can easily switch this skirt with basic black denims and black boots for a college look. I have also opted to showcase the new 'heels and socks' trend. Pairing your heels with cool socks looks really fashionable and brings a whole new look to your pair of heels. And lastly, I finished off the look with a pair of clear frame glasses. I have been obsessed with these recently. Although, I remember how much I absolutely hated wearing these in my school days. But now, I'm willing to wear them with anything and everything! With these clear glasses, I finished off my 'geek chic' look and I was good to go.                   Day Out with Pantaloons Women!

Summer is here, so I thought I'd talk you through this gorgeous (and pink!) look I created with Grassroots by Anita Dongre.  This look is nothing less than perfection. The pastel hues come in so well with the neutral ones that we can’t help but adore how everything comes out together. Grassroots by Anita Dongre is born to revive, sustain and empower India’s crafts and artisans. This is a very important matter in today’s time and it’s very commendable of the designer to have taken an initiative to revive our losing traditional art and craft. The horizontal stripes are very well styled with the vertical stripes and the neck accessory is just like a cherry on the top. The use of Pastel pink and Grey brings out the breezy and cool texture of the outfit. This outfit is the epitome of comfortable fashion. The prints and the colours show themselves and don’t try to steal the light from one another. The makeup is refreshing with the pink eyes and nude lips. The rose cheeks complete the look. The hair is left to breathe and fly in the air.  Oorja (@__oorja) helped me style this look and added so many fun elements like a peach cluth from Eclectic Designs Co. (@eclecticdesignsco). For make up, Priyanka (@shimmeronbypriyankasuri) suggested this bright pink with shimmer look, and a lipstick that's sure to become my favourite this summer! Over all, this look just relaxes all our senses and makes us realise how we need to hit the beach right away. It gives us the summer vibes – not the one with the scorching heat, the one with the pleasant sunshine and cool breeze. Special mention for Mia Bella, Hauz Khas Village, for being the ideal place for this shoot to happen, and Kashish (@kashishnarchalphotography) who made everything seem even more heavenly with the photography skills!

Hope everyone is doing good. If you don’t know already, I started a vlog channel where I’ll be posting a lot of stuff including BTS of shoots, my makeup routine, random blabber and loads of crazy stuff. You can check it out here and I’m happy to see that so many of you are already loving it. I’m planning to vlog at least twice a week so make sure you’re subscribed.
Coming back to the post, I’ve been loving the winter collection at the Veromoda store as I mentioned in my previous post. This time, I wanted something to be more on the casual side still being doable for college or a chill day out with your friends.
Nothing screams classic winter outfit for me more than a chunky white sweater and black jeans. Picked up this white sweater from their new winter collection and paired it with black jeans and chunky black boots. To pretty things up, added this patch work black backpack which are really hot on trend these days. I completed the look with a dark lipshade and I was good to go.              Hope you guys like the post.
Until next time,

By now, you guys must be aware that I’m also an avid lover of silvers. I reach out for silver jewellery every time I need to notch up my outfit a bit.
So, this post is an ode to my love for silver jewellery. I tried to cooperate few of my favourite silver jewellery pieces in this look. First and foremost, can we talk about this gorgeous silver anklet worn as a choker here? This holds a very special place in my heart because this piece has been passed on to me by my mother which was sitting in her closet from past 25 years, you get the feeling right?
It comes handy everyone, I wear it as a choker, Anklet and armlet on different occasions. Now onto the next one, this mang tikka that I’m wearing is actually a neckpiece (I think I’ve this habit of wearing things differently as opposed to how they’re meant to be worn, I just don’t why ?) this is a recent addition to my closet and is a perfect dupe for that vintage silver jewellery. Can you believe it was for 399â‚?1; only? Amazeeinggg right? Vintage jewellery generally starts from 2000 and I was pretty happy when I found it.
Lastly, got this silver cuff is from Rajasthan and the Kadda is supposedly worn on your feet which( I told you) I wore as a bangle.
I styled this gorgeous flared Kurti with a raw silk maxi skirt, my trusty old kolhapuris and I was good to go!
Don’t forget to tag me in your pictures if you happen to recreate this look!
I’ll see you in the next post!

I’ve two posts for you guys today. Yay!!
So, as I was writing this post I was going through some YouTube Travel  videos before and it made me miss all those trips I’ve had in last year and how much it has changed me as a person. I’ve decided to make a conscious effort to travel more often. You know that one moment when you realise that this particular thing is your calling and you feel the happiest when you’re doing that, I guess that’s what Travel and fashion is to me. As cliche as it sounds, I would rather spend my money on experiences rather than materialistic things.
Anyways, coming back to this post I was going through Veromoda’s new collection and I thought of creating a winter look.
Their winter collection is so fun and if I could, I would’ve picked everything from the store. ðŸ™ˆ I even showed you guys their collection and you guys seem to love it.
For this post, I wanted to create a fun look using the staples for autumn/winter season.
The hero of this look is definitely this neon green coat. It’s quite different and yet so fun at the same time. I styled it with this must have suede skirt and a basic white graphic sleeveless tee. To complete I added this classic sling bag, patent leather boots and I was good to go.                        Hope you guys like the look.

Hope everyone is doing good! I’m back with yet another post. I’m not gonna lie, I’m pretty proud of blogging game right now. For once, I’m regular with it. You guys are killing it with your lovely msgs and comments on Instagram and snapchat, thank you for all the love!!
I hosted a Meetup with Coverstory recently in Dlf mall of Noida and it’s always so good to see you guys. It was sooooo much fun. Now, coming back to the post, I’ll be decoding all the four Coverstory looks which I wore.
For the First look, I kept it really casual and fun with this breezy printed blouse from their new collection. I paired it with some jeggings and basic flats.
This outfit is perfect for college and can be paired with a maxi skirt as well. Choose what suits you best. ?
I went ahead and added this silver coin neckpiece and fedora hat and I was good to go.        For the second look, I went all out with this tangerine maxi dress. I think this dress is a perfect mix of comfort and style. It’s so soft that I wanted to stay in this forever. I paired it with some statement earrings and gladiator heels. This look is perfect for a formal function or even a girls night out because wearing body con dresses is too mainstream.
The best part about this dress is that it can be easily dressed up or down. Wear a denim jacket over it and you can completely rock it in the daytime as well. Value for money Amirite?         For the Third look, I chose this floral maxi dress. At first look, It appeared to me quite normal and nothing fancy, your regular floral maxi dress. But, I decided to spice things up and I wore this with some junk jewellery and septum ring. What changed the game for me was the bold black lips and boxed braids. Perfect combination of boho and goth. I’m completely obsessed with this look. I know it’s way too out of the comfort zone but you can tone down this look and still rock it easily.        For the fourth look, I went a little ethnic this time. You guys know how much I love ethnic jewellery and clothes, so I thought why not give this dress my desi spin. The colour of the dress is perfect, I guess I haven’t really worn anything like that. I added a gold choker neckpiece from mom’s closet and to layer things up I added this long chain statement neckpiece. Lastly, I added this chunky gold bangle with stonework. I kept my makeup really clean. Winged liner and some dark lips worked the trick for me.        I hope you guys like the post. Also, I would love to know which one is your favourite out of all the four looks.

I had yet another amazing experience and as always I would love to share it with you guys! After all we are a family right? Last weekend I got this opportunity to select three of my readers through a contest on Instagram and got to style these three winners at Shoppers Stop. It is always overwhelming to see your response and although it was really difficult to pick three people, I managed to go through each entry and selected three lucky girls!
Now, onto the best part, Shoppers Stop planned an awesome styling session for my readers at their new store in Logix City Centre at Noida. On the event day, 13th may, I visited the new store and chose some clothes for myself. I wore this burnt orange Kurti and printed palazzo from Shoppers Stop’s private brand haute curry. I have to say that the eclectic vibe of the brand really resonates with my personal style. As soon as I was done, I met all the winners and began the fun styling session. It’s always great to talk and interact with my readers, so, I styled Mallaica in this cool tie and dye dress from haute curry which she absolutely loved. Then I styled Taniya in this boho mustard top which screams summer with these black shorts and some blingy slip ons. Lastly, I styled Jaya in this chambray shift dress from the brand Life and added a tan belt, black classic sling bag and strappy flats.
I must say the brand Life is really fun and youthful and colourful. It was so much fun interacting with everyone! I also got to style 2 lucky First Citizen members of Shoppers Stop. A big thanks to @shoppers_stop for organising the styling session. It was Such a memorable experience.        These Glasses Are Everywhere, And We're Here to Help You Get the Look!

For me fashion is all about expressing yourself even if it’s breaking the so called ‘rules’ in fashion.
Metallics in your outfit has always been considered to be a going-out outfit.
But, i don’t find any reason to keep Metallics restricted to just that.
So, for today’s post, I’ve thought of sharing a simple day look using metallic. Not to forget, metallic is too hot on trend right now. It’s quite unconventional but obvious to distinguish you in the crowd. You can check out the various pieces in ONLY store, they’ve a great variety from dresses, skirts, tops and shoes they have it all.
I picked up this metallic shorts from ONLY recently. I love mixing different pieces together and the result is always refreshing. I paired these shorts with a white sheer shirt and to tone things down and make it look more of a causal outfit I hung This studded denim jacket on my shoulders. Lastly, I added these white basic converse and Grey cat eye shaped reflectors and I was good to go.
They key to this trend during daytime is to mix it with casual pieces and keeping things causal.
It can be easily made into a going out outfit by switching the converse for red heels and adding a clutch.
Hope you guys like the post, I’ll see you next time!

So many occasions come and go where we push ourselves to wear some heels to add the glam to our outfits. Won’t it be such a treat if we could just wear something cool and casual and actually enjoy ourselves without worrying about tripping and ending up with sore feet. What if I tell you, you can wear your everyday comfy sneakers and style them into something sexy and glam for pretty much every party. Just a little styling and you can be ready to conquer the world. Let’s discuss some of my old looks so I can give a better idea of what I am saying to you guys – My first look is super easy and casual. Just wear a t-shirt dress or just any casual dress with some floral prints or some polkas and pair it with your comfiest sneakers. We can also go with some dress hoodies like in my second look. White sneakers go with pretty much every outfit. We can add a coat or a jacket, like I have with this beige one, and complete the look. Since the look is very simple, I have accessorised it with earrings and some coloured shades. I have also styled my hair in braids to make my look more chic while in my third look I have let my hair loose and kept it super effortless.   In this look, I have tried to play with black and white. The white shirt has some elaborate sleeves and it is paired with cigarette pants with line pattern. The look is perfect for lunch dates or even some semi-formal events. My white sneakers from Clarks shoes add the style to this outfit and some black shades complete the look. I have not accessorised for this look since I wanted to keep it elegant and simple.  I believe that a simple t-shirt and some chic pants paired with sneakers do the job at times. It is effortless and can be mixed and matched in minutes. This look is perfect when you want to take a break from all the sassiness and just have a chill day. It’s sure to be everyone’s Go-to-mall or Go-to-movie outfit.   So white sneakers are fun and easy to pair but the coloured ones are a bit tricky. I have these in orange colour from Reebok and I love how they add the pop to my otherwise subtle outfit. The classic white top and blue jeans which is a staple for every girl can be made chic and stylish by just pairing it with these sneakers. I have got the jeans from Aeropostale and its super comfortable. I love how they make my outfit so fun and playful. I nice beanie is just like the cherry on the cake. Even for the second look, the otherwise subtle outfit from Zara is made so vibrant by just adding these sneakers. The Raybans’ complete the look.   Sneakers can also make a sporty outfit cool and casual. Here I am wearing some very cool co-ordinates with my sneakers and I am carrying this blingy bag to complete my look. This look is super casual and the most comfortable outfit ever. You can get the look from the Lifestyle Store.   Here I have created a street look with some camo pants and a super stylish black top with stripes from Shein. I have my sneakers from Sketchers and to add the dressy-quotient, I have these elaborate hoops and some statement shades. This look is perfect for outings with friends and for casual meet-ups. We can tie up the hair or let it down- it’ll look gorgeous either way.    So now, I’m going to wrap up my list of sneaker looks with my favourite. This is the most interesting combination ever. Here I have paired a very traditional blouse with black joggers. I have worn an overcoat and of course, the sneakers. This combination is very different and works so well that it is bound to shower you with compliments.   TOP 10 FASHION TRENDS OF 2k17. DENIM GAME STRONG With ONLY! Pimples, be gone! Varsity!

It increases metabolism and relaxes the mind. It has been proved that a person who walks daily has less number of health problems compared to another person. And let’s be honest in an era like this, how many of us do this? And hence, Skechers took this initiative to motivate people to walk more and to change their lifestyle. So I collaborated with Skechers on this issue to make people more aware about these issues. For me, comfort has always come first and has been more important than anything, especially in footwear.  Skechers is an American lifestyle and performance footwear company for men, women and children. One of the largest athletic footwear brands in the United States, Skechers has spread its roots to various parts of the world.   Now what I love about the new Skechers GOwalk 4 shoes is that they provide absolute comfort. They have cushion-ny feel to them. With every step that you take you can feel the energy pulsating through you! Remember those times when your feet feels choked up because you have been wearing shoes for way too long? No worries with Skechers GOwalk 4 shoes on! In these shoes, your feet are able to breathe.  All I can say is that, these shoes are unlike anything that I have seen or wore!  So I styles three looks with every place that we went i.e.-  1. INDIA GATE-  I wore these comfortable pair of GOwalk 4 shoes and paired with my basic black tee, fluffy poncho and mom jeans. Who can go wrong with basics? I tied the laces around the ankle to add a twist to my outfit and it totally gave my outfit an edge!    2. CONNAUGHT PLACE - In this place I wore a nude bodysuit and camouflage cargo pants. Then the shoes that I wore had different colors of laces, which instantly made my outfit stand out! Connaught Place has always been my favourite when it comes to chilling in Delhi and what better than exploring this place in my New GOWalk 4 from Skechers India. Its durability and cushioning is just perfect for roaming around the streets of CP.     3. RED FORT - I paired these Skechers GOwalk 4 shoes with frayed jeans and a flannel. This look might be my favourite because of the different design! My new go to pair GOwalk4 from Skechersindia . It's lightweight and seamless design makes it very flexible and convenient for me to use daily.      Skechers recently had a store launch in Connaught Place which was attended by us. It was also attended by celebrities such as Sidharth Malhotra, who was also the host of the event and Shibani Dandekar.    So all I want to say is, Skechers is a great brand and I say that because I have tried it and I swear by it. A brand, which offers comfort with great style, would be my favourite any day.  To checkout their latest GOwalk4 collection, visit their Flagship store in Connaught Place. Cheers!

Hope and pray that everyone’s doing good.
I am always looking for new ideas and projects and for this post, you guys actually motivated me to do so. I read all my comments and some of you guys have been requesting a work wear look. So, for this post, I collaborated with Vero Moda to show you guys how you can style this geek- chic trend. I’ve never been inclined towards chic fashion but it’s always good to step out of your comfort zone, right?
This cute and quirky trend has been doing the rounds on the international runway, having a moment for the past few years.
So, I decided to go ahead and jot down a few pointers if you’re going for this trend.
1. Fake Glasses – Nothing screams nerdy to me more than a person wearing classic black frame glasses. I knew I had to incorporate this in my look when I was planning out the shoot. I got mine from Sarojini. They’re really inexpensive and you can pretty much find them everywhere. Bonus point- they’re a must have accessory this season. 2. Prints – prints are like the hero of this trend. You can easily nail it if you mix the right ones. Diagonal stripes, ditsy square are one of the classic examples. For instance, I’m wearing this diagonal striped skirt from Vero moda which can be easily dressed up or down. 3. Mix and match- Slogan T-shirt with the whole Vintage feel gives it more of a geek chic vibe. I wore this basic slogan tee from vero and this maroon blazer which compliments the printed skirt really well. 4. Sheer blouses- sheer blouses with a bow tie give it that nerdy element. I found one with polka dots in their store in cream colour which can be a wardrobe staple as well. 5. Shoes- Oxfords rule this look. If you want to amp up your geek chic- workwear look, go for Oxfords!! I added these red oxfords to add a dash of geek chic to this outfit with this unexpected footwear choice. I hope you guys like the look. Checkout the full collection at vero moda. They’ve their new collection dedicated to geek chic trend in their stores.
If you happen to recreate this look, don’t forget to tag me in your pictures.

Paris Fashion Week Haute Couture just got over after 9 days filled with immense fashion and varied brands showcasing their collection; from Iris Van Herpen to Elle Saab and Chanel. The best of the best names were present to witness these made to measure collections in Paris. The runway, as usual, remained the place to single out trends; some were a continuation of themes we have seen before in New York, London and Milan, but some were completely new for Spring 2019.  Paris is known for its Sartorial fashion and exquisite choices; so, let’s look at some of the fashion trends that are here to stay.   This trend has reached the runways Since Kim Kardashian wore these and stepped out of her house. Mugler and Chanel came in with tailored jackets while Stella McCartney came up with a bicycle short jumpsuit with a sexy plunging neckline and a huge handbag to complete the look.  This is the trend that brings nostalgia with it, a throwback to the ‘80s in a puffy Saint Laurent dress or go lady-like in Andrew Gn. Polka dots make people feel young and happy. The runway was filled with polka dots in all colours, but the monochromatic one was everybody's favourite.     Jeans and Jackets are usually the things that come to our mind when we talk about Denim, but Designers at the Paris Fashion Week had a different take on it altogether. From tie-dye to acid finish, we have now got an array of choices. Skirts and dresses, all featured denim, with jackets paired with regular slacks at Dior, extremely high waist and high-hem shorts with bold shouldered jackets at Isabel Marant, and a whole slew of designs at Balmain, which was very different from what Balmain usually does. Black and Blazers never go out of fashion; it was prevalent across the Fashion Week 2019. Most people were so happy to see this trend as black blazers are a must-have piece in everybody’s wardrobe. Haider Ackermann gave us looser-fit slim styles that played on the androgynous, as for Celine, nothing can be said about the smart tailoring there. Whether you want simpler or ruffled up, there were enough designers to be using this trend. Another trend that will never get out of fashion, no matter what. And this looks good on everybody, in every size be it small or large, single or a combination, clustered or scattered, it matters not. Whether we are looking at Altuzarra’s life-like florals or the more abstract at Chloe. They look amazing on coats, on skirts, on tops and dresses, accentuating the figure, hiding the bulges and generally adding a sense of feminine to the outfits presented.   Fall Essentials with Veromoda!

SUMMER LAYERING WITH VERO MODA  Thanks for sharing this article useful and lot of information  At Cannes, this year, watching Aishwarya Rai and Nandita Das flaunting the best of themselves and playing with their best styles was a treat to behold. They had their best not because of their expensive outfits but the confidence of being comfortable with the self, personality, and body.

For most of the women in India, fashion ends after giving birth to a child or getting married. They believe that it is not their job to look good once they have a baby to take care. However, we believe it is the time to devote for personal grooming and discovering the new within the self. While embracing the motherhood, it gives a whole new opportunity for women to discover the fashionista within herself.

Here, we have summarized the styling rules for the women of your age. It is entirely okay to spend more on clothes and experiment being classier with layers and prints. But, whatever style you choose, make sure to have the following things studded within you:

Interior Design courses in kochi
-> Realize that you do not need to follow trend blindly. Wear a thing that suits your personality and bring confidence in you.
-> During the early 20s, we all keep experimenting with the stuff. But, by the end of the 30s, everyone knows exactly that work for us. Follow the new discoveries and embrace what looks best on you.
-> The age does not come with the documentation for styling. Effortlessly wear ripped jeans or off-shoulders without giving a second guess to your outfits.
-> If the salwar kameez does not seem pleasing, then stop wearing and work for the same. For those whose signature look is saree, do not shy away from pairing it with unconventional blouses, a crop top or even a short kurta.
-> 30 is the age when girls probably get over the fancy clothing and concentrate on the accessories. To this, we can say that keep your clothing simple and let accessories do the talking.
-> For the hot sunny days, flatter your body type with well-tailored outfits that contributes to beat the heat. Stay away from jeans and prefer comfortable clothing to wear all day long.
-> Don’t struggle to find the right travel wear. Try a pair of ankle length, cotton pants and mix match with your scarfs collection. Make sure that your outfit is weather appropriate while reflecting your personality through the same.
Overall, fashion at 30 is accepting your body with flaws and discovering the imperfect and magical person that you are. Accepting the body also includes nurturing it through cardio, functional training, and yoga to keep yourself fit and fine.

I know how hard it gets to save up money to get that Oh so stylish shirt or that pretty little dress you have always longed for!!! When I was in college, I used to struggle finding the perfect pieces under affordable prices and moreover maintain that chic quotient at the same time!!
I visited their new store last week which is exclusively for women in garden galleria, Noida. The interior of this new store was so elegant & stylish and trust me, at a glance I knew that this is ‘the’ place for the young women of today & my bohogirlies who want to flaunt the diva in them.
I decided to create a unique summer look which can be worn to college as well.
You guys know fusion is my go-to everytime. I chose this white crop top (699â‚?1;) which is so in trend and paired it with this printed dhoti salwar (699â‚?1;) both from the brand called Aakriti. Any outfit is incomplete without accessories and so, I added these beautiful rhinestone earrings(199â‚?1;) which totally accentuated my look.
Lastly, I styled it with these tan flats(499â‚?1;) and I was good to go! And yes I completed one whole look under 2000â‚?1;!!
This outfit is perfect for summer and moreover, the dhoti and crop top can be worn separately with million other pieces as well.
The collection was so unique and as you all can see so affordable that it doesn’t burn a hole in your pocket. (Who doesn’t like to look stylish and save up on those extra bucks at the same time )
It was so much fun guys and I do hope you got some help. Don’t forget to visit the store and see the entire collection for yourself.           How to wear Metallic Trend during day time!!

Hey loves,  So, I have been planning to expand my blog for a long time and I'm finally going to do it soon. I will be focussing on beauty, food and travel as well, along with fashion. And I'm sure you guys have already noticed the website makeover. Speaking of this, there's a new post talking about the trends to look out for in 2017, so go check that out!   You guys know that I've been working with Only for almost a year now. Only is a fashion brand with a broad and international approach. Looking at the latest trends, Only defines its unique version of fashion, and this uniqueness is displayed in its stores and collections.    For this post, I wanted to show you guys exactly how to incorporate patchwork pieces into your outfit.  Gone are the days when patchwork was simply used to make quilts or fix our old jeans. What used to be merely a hobby, has now been adopted by fashion designers everywhere as one of the most popular trends recently! So let me help you hop on to this quirky trend. I styled this patchwork jacket and dress together. The key here is to let one piece be the star of your whole outfit,which in this case is the denim jacket. But this look is not complete yet. To add a little edge, I added these nerdy glasses, which by the way are finally available on The Hype Shop!  To pretty things up, I finished it off with a pretty layered choker necklace and a pair of gladiator heels and I was good to go!

I collaborated with Vero Moda a few days back to try out their new collection which is based on the theme of an ‘active traveller’ or to elaborate more, it consists of travel outfits which are comfortable yet stylish. We all know the truth for all those long hours of travelling in flights, these things are very important.

For my look I picked up, a white shirt paired with green dungarees, a pair of black boots and a red hat to enhance the outfit!
This recent collection by Vero Moda focuses more towards the denim, green and camouflage prints.

I’ve been so regular on the blog lately and I’m loving it. Also, I’ve been thinking to upload some ootds daily on blog, it’ll be good to at least be regular here and creating fresh content for you guys. Let me know if you guys are up for it. ? So, for this post, I collaborated with myntra’s All about you from Deepika Padukone. Their autumn winter collection is now available and I decided to pick a few pieces.
As we’re towards the end of the year and Autumn/winter is upon us, this collection is perfect to add to your closet, It’s very romantic, earthy and has an urban feel to it. What else do we need?
I don’t like to stick to basic black and neutral colours this season as most people do, I get bored so easily. ?
It’s good to add colours and variety in your closet. So, I chose this pink knitted backless top, it is elegant and for jeans, I went in with these basic light wash denim (must have for every girl’s wardrobe).
This outfit is so girly and romantic at the same time. I wore this backless knotted top with a white lace bralette, kept my hair and makeup minimal and added some blingy earrings to pretty things up.

They’re the perfect way to make your look trendy and colourful, or just to hide those dark circles maybe?! We tell you different ways to style this accessory, just like your favourite celeb did! 1. Style your glasses with a leggings and a loose top or some comfortable, baggy shorts. This is a great way to get a comfortable but stylish look for when you want to look great, but don’t feel like putting in all that effort.   2. Glasses are the perfect way to take your Indian outfits to a other level. Add some shades and a little bit of junk jewelry to your long skirts, saris or suits. With minimal effort, you can stand out in the crowd! Wear this to parties or college events for when you want all eyes to be on you. ;)   3. There are so many options when it comes to denims, that you can find a perfect fit, just for you. Add a little bit of retro or just a pop of colour with some tinted, round glasses to complete your look. You can go for clear shades for the nerdy look, or tinted ones if you’re fond of some colour. There’s something for everyone!    4. What’s your favourite kind of dress? It could be an A line, an airy maxi dress, or a casual babydoll one. A dress with some boots and glasses will instantly make your look so much more trendy. So the next time you’re late for college, throw on your favourite dress and add some round glasses to it, and you’re sorted.    5. You may have a lot of celebrities sporting glasses in their ‘airport looks.’ It’s a great way for them to avoid the camera flashes when they arrive; and I know, I know.

I’m jumping with excitement because my Monsoon photo shoot is coming up. As much as I love monsoons, my skin hates it! It gets oily and prone to pimples. Pimples are like that annoying, clingy friend who think “Oh you’re going to a party? Let me come along too.” Pimples are every girl’s enemy, and that too just three days before my shoot? It was a nightmare. My skin had to look flawless.
So there I was, sitting in distress (which makes things worse btw) googling home remedies to get rid of my pimples and then I came across the Himalaya Purifying Neem face wash. It had neem and turmeric which are excellent to remove impurities from the face and give a radiant complexion. I decided to give it a shot, and VOILA! It felt like my pimple got photoshopped off my face, it was gone!
Since then, I swear by this product. My only regret is that I didn’t try it sooner. It is soap free which means it is not harsh on the skin and is suitable for all skin types. The neem helps get rid of all the dirt and impurities and the turmeric helps even out the skin tone and makes it supple and soft.

Good thing about fashion is, it keeps on changing and repeating itself, this time Vero Moda brought back this trend which was all over the runaways of Europe. This trend has been the talk of the town this season which derives its inspiration from the ancient Renaissance fashion. So, I decided to play around this trend. Renaissance fashion was all about fabrics like silk, brocade, velvet, cotton and floral prints. This collection has been really big on runways.
I’ve always loved florals, they’re so summery, fun and bright. I styled this summer dress from Vero Moda which has this really cool floral print all over with dark undertones, a simple cut and structure. It’s feminine  and edgy at the same time. I decided to keep the styling really simple and romantic, just to keep the Renaissance feel alive. I paired the dress with these amethyst floral studs with a simple classic thin golden metal belt from Vero Moda. To pretty things up, I added these ankle strap pump and this gorgeous pastel pink bag with gold detailing from Vero Moda, for hair and makeup, I was feeling a bit too fancy that day, so I went ahead and curled my hair (mind you, I spent 1.5 hours on them #Bighairproblems) and went for pink undertones for my makeup, a simple cat-eye, matte pink lips and I was done for the day. #TRENDYVEROMODA#floralgraphics#artinspired#vintage#digitalprints

I'm back again with another post. Quick update: I started working out this month and have received so many questions about my diet and routine so get ready to see a post super soon.    For today's post, I collaborated with Reliance trends to show you guys how I style three different looks and I made it even more interesting by restricting myself to only 3500 Rs. So I had a challenge to shop under this amount and create three different looks. Reliance trends recently launched their website and every product is awesome that I was so confused while ordering.  I'll be linking all the products at the end so you guys can directly buy it from their. Also, I made sure to order stuff which I can style differently every time. So it's a win win. ðŸ»   For the first look, I wore this white embroidered kurta with cream coloured palazzo pants. I added tons of silver jewelry. To complete the look I styled it with some black aviators and black embroidered boots and I was good to go.  Hint hint: This might be my favorite look out of the three.             For the second look, I styled this yellow printed Kurta which I ordered from their website. Summer is here and yellow sure adds that much needed summer upgrade to your wardrobe, so make sure you've some colorful pieces. This look is super easy breezy. I paired this printed Kurta with the same palazzos which I wore in the first look, see, I told you guys I ordered staple pieces which can be styled differently. Then to complete the look I paired it with some orange vintage sunglasses and the star of the show a septum ring and that completes my second look.             For the third look, because I had already styled two ethnic looks I decided to switch things up. I wore this tribal printed romper and paired it a yellow clutch that I got from sarojini for just 100 Rs. I opened the buttons at the back and wore it as a off shoulder romper.           So, I hope you guys like the post, and don't forget to checkout the reliance trends website for such cool finds and if you happen to recreate any of the looks, don't forget to tag me in your picture.  Until next time, Xoxo #Bohogirlies  How to Pull Off The Geek Chic Trend!

After this elongated season of winter, we are now nearing summer and we canfinally let go off all the sweaters and thick coats that have been stacked up in our closets since so long. It is time to take out our light-weight, cottons and all the florals that also seem to be trending at this moment. We, being in the Delhi temperature, face pretty scorching heat and it gets very important to choose our outfits right to take out our entire day in them and don’t feel the irritation. In summers, we need to be extra cautious with our clothing as well as our health. The sun constantly sucks up all our fluids and it should be our utmost priority to keep ourselves hydrated at all times. Drink a lot of water and we can also substitute it with some coconut water or fresh juices when plain water gets boring. Being hydrated also keeps our skin fresh and clear. We won’t be victims of the summer acne and our skin will remain soft and supple, provided we are hydrated of course. Now with the most important thing being clear, let’s move on to the fashion part. This season has a lot of sweating involved in it so we need to be super wise with our clothing to avoid any inconvenience and embarrassing moments. Let’s go through the things that we need to keep in mind to make clever fashion choices this summer. DO. Go for maxi dresses. They are fun and they are easy. We don’t need to put in our heads for a lot of pairing as they can be just worn and we’ll be ready for the day. They are flowy so they don’t stick to our silhouette and since they are light, they don’t feel heavy on our bodies. Maxi dresses look very elegant in plain as well as printed fabrics. Floral and stripes look super cute and you might just end up making it your go-to outfit this summer.  Dress :Faballey Sandals and Handbag :Ceriz  Dress : Ajio Life  Dress : Max Fashion India The oxidised jewellery paired with the traditional slides and bag, add a lot of quirkiness to the outfit.  Dress :Stalk Buy Love DON’T. Refrain yourself from getting too much into denims because they are on the heavier side. They might make you feel tired and irritated. I know we can’t let go of our staple blue jeans but we can sure try to avoid it and wear it only when we miss it too much. Denim jackets are also heavy but we can wear them if we pair them wisely.  Outfit – Akashi Clothing DO. Giving hopes in your eyes regarding your favourite denim jeans, it wouldn’t be wise of me to not tell you what you can pair it with. So since the denim is going to be quite fitted from our waist, we go for simple cotton t-shirts to wear it with them. They look statement as well as super casual and comfortable. Go for an oversized one so you feel even more comfortable and cool. Remember – Prioritize your comfort this season.  T-Shirt : Levi’s  T-Shirt - Guess DON’T. Don’t go for dark colours because they absorb heat and end up making us feel even hotter than it actually is. Blacks are a no-no and why do we even need to wear black, let’s exploit the summer colours in the summer season.  Dress : The Burnt Soul DO. Now you can’t wear black – but you can wear white. White is ‘the’ summer colour and we must exploit this colour to the fullest. White helps us remain cooler and it looks super cute when styled properly. Pastel shades are also a lot fun and they make the outfit look very light and breezy.  Outfit :Lecoanet Hemant  Outift : Anita Dongre Grassroot  Outfit : The Burnt Soul DON’T. Don’t go for fabrics through which air can’t pass. Cottons are perfect for this season while fabrics like velvet, polyester make you feel itchy and uncomfortable. DO. Invest in some nice cottons, linens and even chambrays. Chambrays are a lot lighter than denim and are perfect for summers.  Joggers : Go Colors DON’T. Do not. I repeat. Do not leave your house without the sunscreen on. It’s very important if you really value your skin and want to protect it from the sun. Some ideas for when your heart feels like going a bit traditional?  Outfit : Pantaloons Fashion  Fusion Wear : AJIO Life  Fusion Wear : Raisin Global Some Formal looks -    Blazer-Dress : Made by Cuin and Fashcapsule  Outfit : The Khumaar So guys this is all for the summer do’s and don’ts. I hope these tips and tricks help and I hope you have a lot of fun this summer just like I do. Play with your outfits and have a lot fun with it. Happy Summer to us!

This week was really productive and I'm super pumped and happy because of that. Do you know that feeling where you tick off everything on your to-do list. Speaking of lists who else loves lists? I'll be the first one to admit that I'm a total nerd and I love making lists. I don't know what it's about lists but I can't work without them.  So enough about lists, let's get back to the post , shall we?  You guys know I'm all about Boho fashion, so this week I decided to do a post around retro bohemian style. So, I went to Only's store to pick up some pieces up and oh boy! was I spoilt for choice. But, I had to pick one so I chose this bright red pom pom top.   In a nutshell, retro bohemian style is all about mixing and matching vintage pieces with flowing silhouettes, ethereal prints and statement accessories. Think of Fresh colours and modern details which makes it perfect for the modern woman’s wardrobe.  I decided to style this red pom pom top which had really cool lace detailing at the front and the design at the back which was the show stealer for me. Paired it with printed bell bottom pants and a heart studded bag. For hair and makeup, I did two loose braids and kept the makeup natural. Lastly, to add that retro vibe I added these black round frame sunglasses and I was good to go.    Hope you guys like the post. For more options you can checkout the only store and you might end up giving retro bohemian fashion a try!!    Until next time,  Xoxo #Bohogirlies <3>

Feels like it’s been ages since I wrote a post on the blog. If you follow me on Instagram, you must be knowing that I went to Europe for 15 days with Contiki. Now that I’m back, I’ve loads of stuff lined up for you guys.
Speaking of which, I am craving to share some of the fall outfits ( still can’t believe it’s fall already. where did the year go??? )
So, for this post, I decided to share some outfits around Pu leather jackets. For those of you who don’t what Pu Leather jacket is, It’s basically just faux leather. I’m a firm believer in using cruelty free products and Pu leather sails the boat for me. I picked mine last week from Only’s store. They’ve tons of colour options but I decided to stick to classics – black and white.
I’ll be sharing two looks- One for a night out with your girlfriends and the other one is more of a casual relaxed look.
For the first look, I wanted to spice things up so I wore this black bodycon side slit skirt and a black Pu leather jacket with a bralette underneath. Lace instantly adds so much more to this rather grungy outfit. I added a choker to complete the look and for makeup, I was feeling a smokey eye that day and oh my! Just see how it pulls the whole look together. I love how this look turned out, perfect amalgamation of grungy and feminine at the same. Rock this outfit for a party or even a formal event with slight changes according to your style and you’re guaranteed to stand out!               For the second look, I wanted it to be more relaxed, still perfect for college days or shopping and stuff. I wore this classic combo red flannel and boyfriend jeans and to add a little more edge to this outfit, I added this cream coloured Pu leather jacket. A Jacket adds so much more to this rather casual outfit, hang it across your shoulder or wear it as it is. There’s so much one can do with jackets just by switching some pieces. Without a doubt, it’s one of the wardrobe staples for winter. You can find various other jackets at Only’s stopre and the best part about them is that they’re way cheaper than your regular Leather jacket and easy to maintain as well!         xoxo #Bohogirlies <3>

Hey loves,Â  As all of you know, I had travelled to Abu Dhabi very recently. The trip was exceptional! We got to stay in the VIP suite at the Emirates Palace, and visited the Ferrari World, the Marina Circuit and much more. Most of all, we got to indulge in and be a part of a culture, that is so different from ours. It really was an amazing trip! So, winter is fading away and soon, spring will be upon us. Spring is the season of bloom. The weather is so happy and colourful and this gives a lot of scope for fashion. It's the time to experiment with edgy trends and colours without fear! For this post, I am collaborating with Vero Moda, specifically their Spring Collection. The Vero Moda Spring Collection is one of excitement and shows us exactly what's coming this season. It displays a wide variety of fashion, ranging from the classic florals in 'Country Love', to beachy stripes in 'Sicily'. But, the one to watch out for is the new trend it brings, which is the Print Paisley. Its intricacy and density of prints purely takes its inspiration from all things Persian. We have witnessed a revival of the paisley across the catwalks during London Fashion Week, from Topman to Jonathan Saunders. The next part is how to style this new trend of Paisley. I added some silver junk jewellery, namely a bell antique silver cuff, a ring, an anklet, and finally, a septum nose ring.Â  These photos were shot at the Lady Baga restaurant. It promises to bring the feel of Goa to New Delhi, with it's shacks, sand and all the colours. This location was perfect, as it matched the whole vibe of the outfit.

Bodysuits recently have been devloped as the 'new craze'. Every celebrity has been seen wearing one and women are on the verge of discovering that those are god gifted. 
  


For all of you who don't know about it- 
What is a bodysuit?
  It is a skin tight garment which is strechable and has bottons which you fasten at your crotch (No, that is not as uncomfortabel as it sounds like). Look at the image below to get a better look.  


They come is various designs and shapes. The bodysuits have a world of their own, and once you buy one, you'll exactly know what we are talking about. 
Look at some of the bodysuits below for more reference. This is how it looks like, exactly like a swimsuit but not a swimsuit.  



Now one can pair it up with a lot many things. We go by the motto, 'when in doubt, wear a bodysuit'. Pair it up with jeans, shorts, kimono etc etc, there are infinte possiblities.
Initially two years back, they were not in trend but when Kim Kardishan and Kendall Jenner were clicked wearing one, that was all people could talk about.

   We have created four looks in which we give ideas on how to style a bodysuit. 
If you live in Delhi, then you can easily shop it at H&M and Forever 21, but if not then order it online from Forever 21 or any other website such as asos.com or ajio.com 

Look Number 1. 



You can wear bodysuits with traditional skirts or plazzos. It creates a proportionate look which guarantees a great look. This is a black cold shoulder bodysuit. As bodysuits are skin tight, wearing them with something flowy gives you a great look and feel. It also gives you an edge over your outfit! 

LOOK NUMBER 2-


   



We all know how crazy people are for boyfrriend jeans, though the most common problem that we face is how to style them? So Kritika styled her favourite boyfriend jeans with her bodysuit. This bodysuit was purchased from Ajio.com. For people looking for an extensive range of bodysuits, don't forget to check out Ajio.com. They have a great collection, which shall leave you wanting for more!

The second one is from Asos! It's a mesh bodysuit and totally lights up the outfit!

LOOK NUMBER 3-



Now another way to style a bodysuit is to pair it up with shorts and put on a kimono over it. This again gives your outfit an edge. Women usually pair it up with a camisol, but it doesn't provide the shape to the body as a bosysuit does!


LOOK NUMBER 4-




Now this a sporty look. Pair up a boysuit with your favourite jeans or jeggings and pair it up with shoes. Take a sling or a back-pack and you are all ready to rock your day! 

Well thats pretty much it. We hoped we helped! 
If you haven't bought a bodysuit already, then do! Bodysuit looks good on all shape and sizes. So NO more doubt, more shopping! 
Cheers!  Flyrobe- Renting clothes made easy! SUMMER LAYERING WITH VERO MODA Bring on the Sparkle | Confluence by Swarovski Travelling in Style with Vero Moda.  I'm glad to know that I can pair a bodysuit with a lot of things. I think I'll buy a women's stretch fitting bodysuit from a good store and wear it with jeans. Thanks for the idea that I can use a kimono to style it as well.  Hi, noticed two typos in the article: its bottom and uncomfortable  Thanks for your tips and tricks!

1. Quirksmithjewelry
I personally love jewelry from this store. It’s quirky, stylish and so different from what I usually see!
I have often uploaded pictures wearing their products for instance the ‘maal’ nosering, which is my absolute favorite.  They have an Instagram shopping account as well a website!
Now quirksmith doesm’t have a lot of products to choose from but the ones that are available are the ones you are  going to fall in love with!




2. Ajio.com

It has only been a year since this website has launched and it’s on my top favorites list already. It has an extensive range of silver junk that you can choose from. Their ethnic collection in particular never fails to mesmerize silver jewellery lovers. We at bohogirl can vouch for this site.



3. Tjori.com

One of the best features of this website is that it has tribal designs from around the world. Most of the Indian websites show the designs that are inspired from the Indian culture itself but this website is all about designs from all over the world. 





4. Flyingfishaccessories.com

I recently came across this page and I couldn't have been luckier. If you are a sort of person who loves wearing simple jwelery which adds on your outfit and isn't too heavy or over the top, then this website is just perfect for you. It has all kinds of artsy and quirky designs!

  Hi, Kritika,

Beautiart Jewellery you are wearing. 

Thats correct that these are top 6 websites for buying silver jewellery. 

Metals like, silver, brass, alloy etc are good for skin as they are harmless and does not affect skin anyway. 

Great Post.

Tell me everything that’s been going on in your lives recently.   Today I’ll be talking about something a little bit fancy. Okay, really fancy. Swarovski reached out to me and sent over some stunning pieces that they created in collaboration with designer Suneet Varma. As a part of their new collection called Confluence in which they collaborated with 11 amazing Indian designers.   Nown to the fun stuff, I’ll be showing you how I styled the pieces that I received and added my own twist to them! I created two looks, and am just in love with how simple, yet classy and vibrant they look.   The first was all about the florals. Since the jewellery sent to me was very simple and sophisticated, I decided to go all out with my outfit and picked a white blouse with a high neck and paired it with a floral skirt and dupatta. Despite everything that was going on with the outfit, the earrings and maang tikka just pulled the entire outfit together, and took it up a notch. The jewellery added a touch of sophistication to the fun elements of my outfit. For the second look I put together, I wore rose gold Chaandbali style chandelier earrings, and a bracelet with a subtle blue off shoulder kurta and sharara embroidered with vibrant goden designs all over. The final look was classy as well as fun, and I've been in love with it ever since! Can't wait to find more occassions to put it on again. Since the earrings were the star of the show, I kept the rest of my accessories very minimal, and skipped on a neckpiece. Instead, I picked a bracelet to balance the look out. I love how the jewellery is so versatile that it complemented both my fun, floral outfit and subtle, turquoise one. I can see myself styling the earrings in so many more ways, with even my western party wear and formal wear. And it’s because of this that I think the pieces are a great buy!

To ensure that your product is completely authentic, the brand has come up with an #AskForTheTag campaign, in which you’ll be provided with a distinct, IB tag showing the authenticity of the product, just to ensure complete transparency and trust with the consumer.

Which was your favourite piece, and how would you style it? Indian, western or fusion?! Let me know.

So I’m back from my trip to Goa and I’m super excited to share all the pictures and my experiences on the blog super soon.
Now, that I’m back, I miss the pleasant weather. Delhi is burning right now
So, the other day I went to this cool cafe imperfecto which is in Hauz Khas. For my outfit, I wore this quirky abstract print shirt from Only. They’ve this new range of abstract print tops and dresses which is perfect to amp up your boring casual wear. This collection has been inspired by cartoonish prints/Pop art which gives a breath of fresh air.
I’m all about quirky fashion. After all, fashion is about having fun right?
Whenever I stress too much about my outfit, it ends up looking weird and most of the times(all the time) when I only have 10 mins to get ready for some reason I end up looking pretty decent.
I wore this pink quirky top which had these cool print all over with overalls. You guys know how much I love my hairdos. So, I went ahead and did a side braid which added just the right amount of fun to it.
Lastly, I paired it with these wooden wedges which I’m obsessed with and I was good to go!
Hope you guys like the post, can’t wait to see how you add this trend in your look.
If you happen to recreate this look don’t forget to tag me.

Creating hairstyles is fun and it is even more fun when we recreate our timeless Bollywood magic.Â  I tried creating three hair looks from our beloved Bollywood and I couldnâ€™t be happier with the result. The biggest support in this process was the BBLUNT's amazing range of hair products that fully lent their hand in this dramatic recreation.Â   The first look is a easy to do every day style which is a quick one with rolling hair and just clipping them behind. The hair are left to fly but are also clipped at the back so that it doesnâ€™t irritate the face on a damp day. The  BBLUNT's Climate Control Anti Frizz Leave InÂ Cream creates the perfect moisture in the hair and makes it so much easier to be playful with them. The BBLUNT Spotlight Hair Polish for Instant Shine helped in ending the final look and giving it the perfection that it required. Itâ€™s best suited for Indian hair and we couldnâ€™t be happier.Â     The second hair look looks like the most complicated one but it actually is quite simple. The hair are damped and sprayed with  BBLUNT's Intense Moisture Hair Serum and thatâ€™s when the styling begins. The hair are tied up in the most dramatic way I think and the hair are ended with a super pretty braid. The hair are in place and it is very comfortable specially on hot days. Who said you need to open your hair to make them look fancy. The final touches are given by the BBLUNT Spotlight Hair Polish for Instant Shine and you are good to go.Â     The third and final look is the most elegant one. Itâ€™s pretty quick and simple but looks just amazing. The hair are prepped with the BBLUNT Climate Control Anti - Frizz Leave In Cream and are then twisted from one side and are tied at the back with a bunch of twisted hair. It has got a good bounce and adds a lot of feminine touch. The hair are then finished with the BBLUNT Spotlight Hair Polish.       DRESS IDEAS FOR THIS NEW YEAR Travelling in Style with Vero Moda.

Weddings are magic! Especially Indian Weddings – where the cousins and aunts and uncles are more excited than the bride and groom. Where the wedding is someone else’s, but it’s us who’s stuck with the month long planning of what to wear and from where to buy. Even before the outfit craze begins, there’s a phase where the entire family has joined the gym and is drinking green tea every day to get rid of some extra kilos as they get ready to slay at the wedding.    Weddings are indeed beautiful! We Indian families make it fun too!   Since how long have you been planning to look the hottest younger sister at your elder sister’s wedding? Don’t tell me you haven’t added ‘Paise Do Joote Lo’ song to your sangeet playlist! I have and I know that you have too. We don’t celebrate wedding as a ceremony between two people, instead we celebrate it like a grand festival with functions lined up for an entire week. That week goes by dressing up, dancing and having fun – but the most stressful time is the time when we need to plan our outfits.    ‘I need the yellow outfit for the haldi ceremony and the father needs a blue kurta for the engagement party. The mother needs a light pink saree for the sangeet while the aunt needs a bright one for the wedding. The groomsmen are co-ordinating and wearing shades of green while the bridesmaids are going for shades of violet. Dadi also needs an off-white elegant saree and Dadaji said he will only wear a deep red kurta.’   The list can go endless and this is for one function. Remember the festivities go on for a week.  So what we really need during this demanding time is Manyavar – because Wedding = Manyavar.  What if I told you that you can sort your outfits in a day with the clothes that you love at this one stop destination? Sounds unreal right?    Manyavar brings us #DresscodeManyavar..kyunki shaadi mei impression toh jamana hota haina.  Manyavar has amazingly curated wedding outfits for the entire family so that we all enjoy this festival of marriage together and with all of our hearts. Weddings aren’t supposed to be about stress, they’re only about love, love and of course impression.

ROBERTO CAVALLI.

With spring around the corner, we make way to shop! For those girls out there who like to go luxury shopping, this year’s Roberto Cavalli collection is all that I’ve dreamed about.

A couple of weeks ago Roberto Cavalli launched their Spring Collection in their store, which is in DLF Emporio. We went to attend the launch, and what can we say? The collection was stunning.
Their collection is full of light and breezy colors. They have a beautiful collection of watches and scarfs.
Now my personal favorite part of the collection were the shoes. They have a wide collection ranging from pencil heels to shoes. All in different colors and designs, and you are going to fall in love with them!
Now Roberto also had sunglasses and stoles. If one of you ever decide to go there and see this collection, you won’t be disappointed with the it
Luxury brands are expensive, of course, but what makes it worth it, is the quality of it and, Roberto’s spring collection did not disappoint me even a little bit in these quotients.
If any one of you is looking to buy a luxury pair of shoes or bag, make sure you drop by at the store. I guarantee you shall be leaving the store with a shopping bag! 
We’ll leave some pictures below where you can see for yourself!
