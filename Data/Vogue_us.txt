 In 19th-century rural China, peasant women of the Jiangyong County in the southern Hunan province developed a secret script named Nüshū. Its characters, mastered by women and indecipherable to men, appear in thin, downward-slanting wisps, like spider legs dancing across paper. Women used the writing system to communicate their most intimate thoughts to one another in China’s heavily gender-divided society—a disparity that still endures today. These ancient origins have inspired the founders of a new NVSHU, an all-female music collective founded in 2018 among the ever-expanding skylines of modern-day Shanghai. Lhaga Koondhor (aka Asian Eyez), Amber Akilla, and Daliah Spiegel began the project last year by offering deejaying lessons to femme, non-binary, and LGBTQ+ people in the local electronic music scene. But beyond that, they hoped to provide these marginalized individuals—among them, emerging producers, DJs, and artists—a gathering place in the city. Daliah Spiegel, Amber Akilla, and Lhaga Koondhor Although this class of DJ workshop has become increasingly prevalent in the West, in Shanghai, NVSHU is the first of its kind. As expat DJs, Koondhor and Akilla bonded over their parallel histories of navigating the white, male-dominated Western club industry. Despite coming from different backgrounds—Spiegel, originally from Vienna, relocated to Shanghai in 2014; Koondhor and Akilla moved from Switzerland and Australia, respectively, in 2017—all three strove to activate “a space that allows female and LGTBQ+ people to DJ without feeling intimidated,” Akilla says. In their eyes, NVSHU is more of a loose network of instructors and participants with similar values organized over social media rather than “a closed members club,” Koondhor says. NVSHU offers lessons in both English and Mandarin, and while its founders are English speakers, they are careful of imposing their native language onto local students and extend that sensitivity to every corner of what they do. As an expatriate, Akilla is acutely aware of the limits of trying to transfer Western ideas of feminism to Shanghai; the goal of NVSHU is to empower marginalized individuals through music education, but they are also wary of engaging in overtly political discussions with their students. “I can’t tell a woman who is growing up here how she should perceive her sexuality or her gender identity,” Akilla says. “That’s a form of colonization. You can only support people on their journey.” Lhaga Koondhor and Jirui Lin Discourse on feminism is fundamentally different in China than in Australia and Europe; both share the goal of gender equality, but, in recent years, the Chinese Women’s Rights Movement has faced rigid government repression. In its early days, China’s Communist Party enforced state feminism as part of its ideology, with equal labor fueling the country’s economic resilience—so much so that during the ‘50s and ‘60s, the nation boasted the highest female labor force participation in the world. Market reforms over the last few decades, however, led to a disproportionate number of women losing jobs compared to men, and since 2007, the Chinese government has peddled propaganda encouraging young, educated women to get married, have children, and realign themselves with traditional gender roles. Those in their late 20s who refuse to comply are deemed undesirable sheng nu, or “leftover women,” but in response to this, the China’s Women’s Rights movement has found ways to evade the country’s Internet censorship and gather force on social media—even adding their voices to the global #MeToo movement. NVSHU's founders consider themselves devoted feminists and allies, but their central aim is to facilitate empowerment through individual personal expression—itself a radical act. “We want to encourage people to explore their creativity,” Akilla says. “We’ve started with music as the tool to do that, but we hope that the confidence people get from learning with a practice like deejaying can support them in other parts of their life.” Jirui Lin The goal of NVSHU, then, is to apply an inclusive vision to Shanghai’s emerging nightlife scene, which exists as a unique space for people to explore their creative freedom. The city’s nocturnal world is, after all, still a relatively blank canvas. Due to the strict policies enforced by the Cultural Revolution of Mao Zedong in the ‘60s and ‘70s, certain musical genres and instruments were fiercely regulated for decades; following Mao’s death in 1976, the country entered a new era of modernity and accelerated economic progress, but there was still no popular nightlife in China until the ’90s. The underground club scene, as a result, is still in its infancy. NVSHU and their contemporaries—left-field collectives such as Asian Dope Boys and record labels like Genome 6.66 Mbp—are actively sculpting this subcultural landscape on their own terms. For Koondhor, electronic music provided the conduit for her own personal expression. In her teenage years before she entered the music industry, Koondhor worked in a buttoned-up finance apprenticeship at a Swiss bank, following in the footsteps of a family line of bankers. “The weekend was my escape,” she says, an opportunity to transform into a more fearless version of herself. Club culture became a playground for brash style statements—a black marker under her eye à la Lisa “Left Eye” Lopes or DIY shredded jeans. Akilla, who has always favored a more androgynous wardrobe of sneakers and oversize suit jackets says that “mainstream rhetoric has a very narrow constraints on femininity, so one thing the underground has taught me is how to learn and redefine beauty for myself.” Lhaga Koondhor, Jirui Lin, Amber Akilla, and Daliah Spiegel The collective is living proof of music’s role as a powerful medium for expressing your identity: NVSHU’s Red Bull documentary, which was released in February, features one of their mentees Jirui Lin, a girl from the coastal Guangdong Province with a taste for techno, gabber, and grime music. In the film, she wears black harness fetish-wear and adorns her face with temporary tattoos in rebellion against her traditional parents. “Being here, I’ve started to reshape what freedom means for me,” Koondhor adds. As the city’s freedoms continue to evolve, [NVSHU is standing at the vanguard, with more and more women encouraged to follow their lead.

 Last time FKA Twigs performed as part of New York City’s Red Bull Music Festival four years ago, she took to the stage in a massive hangar space in Brooklyn surrounded by ten dancers who were all decked out in gothic, club-ready Alexander McQueen looks. It’s an undeniably hard act to follow, but the British singer may have one-upped herself this past weekend with her new show, “Magdalene.” Fans were treated to a sneak peek of the spectacular costumes, designed by rising London fashion star Ed Marler, thanks to her stylist Matthew Josephs. He posted an Instagram image of twigs in as a modern day Marie Antoinette, wearing a full taffeta silk ensemble in rehearsals, what he described as a “shirt x robe à la Française.” With a total of seven baroque-inspired looks, Twigs’s performance wardrobe at the Park Armory this past weekend was nothing short of ethereal. She kicked off the show dressed in what looked like an 18th century courtier’s ensemble—neatly cropped jacket with accordion sleeves and ruffled bloomers—tap-dancing furiously for the crowd as the curtains pulled back from the stage. Then, against a backdrop of  blue skies dotted with fluffy clouds, she emerged in a haze of smoke wearing all white, like she’d just floated down to earth with her extra wide-brimmed feather-trimmed hat. At one point twigs did seem to be suspended in mid-air, twirling down a pole in the same mesmerizing way she does for her new  “Cellophane” video, decked out in a frothy corset, matching bikini bottoms, and mile-high perspex stripper heels. For the grand finale though, the aforementioned Antoinette-inspired ball gown took the spotlight as a cloud of glitter rained down on to the audience. As far as princess-worthy fashion moment go, this one took the crown. The latest fashion news, beauty coverage, celebrity style, fashion week updates, culture reviews, and videos on Vogue.com.

 You never forget your first time in Lagos. As Paloma Elsesser will tell you, the Nigerian megatropolis seems to pulsate with vibrant energy at pretty much every hour of the day and night. “The colors and the heat make you feel in a daze, but that daze is spicy,” she says. “Each day weaves into the next with sticky harmony.” The model made her second trip to Lagos last month for Homecoming, the annual festival thrown by British-Nigerian music maven Grace Ladoja. The long weekend of events included a pop-up shop packed with one-time-only collaborations (Kenneth Ize and Mowalola were among the Nigerian designers who made limited-edition pieces), a soccer tournament, and a series of intimate panel discussions in which Elsesser participated alongside designer Irene Agbontaen and stylist Ade Samuel. The grand finale? A spectacular concert that brought together the best in local talent as well as a few special international guests. “Of course seeing Skepta is always a favorite. The energy that young people bring for him is what makes Homecoming so special,” says the model. “My friend Grace also put me on to this new artist called Rema. It was amazing to witness his first major performance.” For Elsesser, the most memorable moments of her trip came with little fanfare. “I love going to Tarkwa Bay; it’s this amazing beach that has an incredible artisan community, and the families who live on the small island are so kind,” she says. “Last year I hung out with a little girl named Stephanie all day, and this time I spent the day with her and her sister Popo. We went swimming and talked about boys and clothes all afternoon. It was really beautiful to feel connected to someone whose life looks so different from mine.” See more highlights from her trip in the slideshow above.

 In the hot, steamy throes of summer, what’s more appealing than sliding into a slinky slip? Enter Refine, a new London-based label inspired by the classic sweet-nothing from former Net-a-Porter editor Anina Hée. “I really wanted to make something that is resistant to trends because that’s the way I shop; I wouldn’t buy something that wouldn’t endure more than one season,” says the Swiss-born designer whose own closet is filled with discreetly chic pieces by The Row and Khaite. “The slip has been a staple for decades and it still is today.” Taking inspiration from ’90s fashion icons such as Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and the Prada runway, Refine’s debut collection features six luxuriously spare styles—including a particularly alluring calf-skimming bias-cut dress and high-waisted skirt—cut from heavy silk satin and Crepe de Chine that’s been woven and dyed in Italy. “I’m very conscious of quality,” Hée says of the built-to-last range, which starts at $200. “My mom always used to say to us kids when we were buying things, ‘Check where it’s made!’” To that end, the silhouette-defining fabric has a reassuring heft (in other words, the new slip dresses skim the body rather than cling to it). “It has this way that it flatters all these different body types and drapes so nicely,” she says. Just as considered is the brand’s palette: Alongside year-round black and white offerings, a handful of limited-run specialty shades—such as dark chocolate, a seawater blue, and a single ditsy floral print—will be in seasonal rotation. Also on offer? Au courant padded headbands and voluminous scrunchies to ensure no precious piece of silk is left behind. Says Hée, “It’s an easy way to reuse leftover fabrics”—and slide into summer, dressed from head to toe.

 Kristen Stewart never fails to make an outfit feel very her. ("Her" being synonymous with a grungy, punky aesthetic.) Just a few days ago, she paired a Thom Browne tartan gown with Nike Cortez trainers, subverting the whole dress-and-heels rule that many Hollywood A-listers abide by. Today, the actress’s promo tour for her new film, Charlie’s Angels, continued in London—and this time she put her unique stamp on suiting. How, exactly? She ditched the day clutch in favor of a cooler, and much more fitting accessory. Hitting her photo call, Stewart carried around a blue baseball cap as though she just wandered in from a day of errands—a look that falls in line with Stewart’s whole  carefree vibe. The hat-as-handbag looked especially right when paired against her signature outfit: a shrunken blazer, classic white tee, and light-wash denim. She also wore the Cortez sneakers that she’s been wearing on the film’s promo tour, making the case for a recycle-and-reuse moment (something she’s also done with her favorite pair of jeans). To finish things off, she then piled on layered necklaces and called it a day.

 Kacey Musgraves is clearly all-in for Christmas. She’s already released a holiday album—revisit 2016’s A Very Kacey Christmas if you need a refresher—and she’s releasing a holiday variety show special on Amazon Prime Video, titled the Kacey Musgraves Christmas Show, at the end of this month. Musgraves’s special will center on the music, which runs the gamut from seasonal classics to selections from A Very Kacey Christmas (with some new songs thrown in for good measure). There will also be a number of special guests, including Lana Del Rey, Troye Sivan, and Musgraves’s very own grandmother. Last night, Musgraves debuted a new song from the upcoming special, “Glittery,” on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, and she clearly took direct inspiration from the song name when it came time to pick out an outfit. Musgraves chose a sparkling green Christian Siriano suit for the occasion, a set that’s just as cheerful and bright as an actual Christmas tree, which is especially appropriate given the song’s lyrics: “You light me up like star light on a Christmas tree/Every single kiss is like a gift to me.” Musgraves in that festive suit is clearly a gift to us all.

 Yesterday in New York City, Kendall Jenner stepped out in a simple, no-fuss look: a black turtleneck, a cropped white zip-up jacket by Magda Butrym, and a pair of black square-toe boots. Under her arm was a pint-size Gucci monogrammed shoulder bag. But the standout item here was Jenner’s high-waisted, light-wash jeans. So what makes this pant, the most unassuming component of a classic supermodel’s wardrobe, so special? The secret sauce denim is typically a confident light wash that hugs the body, meaning everything is on display. The jean is high-cut but not quite a mom jean silhouette: It is hiked up just enough to skim the waist and reveal a sliver of navel. The cut includes a perfectly proportioned space between cuff and heel that shows a healthy slice of ankle. Jenner is far from the first to wear the supermodel-friendly pants. Back in the day, Elle Macpherson loved the jean, wearing it casually with teeny T-shirts and dressing it up with preppy blazers. Naomi Campbell also wore a button-fly version back in 1996 at the opening of the now-defunct “Fashion Cafe.” Cindy Crawford also sported a pair while traveling, typically with a thick belt — a look Crawford’s daughter Kaia Gerber has more recently made her own. Jenner wears the easy denim at a time when most models are stepping out in flashy, paparazzi-aware looks. (Of course, Jenner flexes her outré fashion chops, too.) But the tried-and-true jean is the mark of veteran supermodel. It says, “No bells and whistles needed here!” (Look to Gisele Bündchen’s repeated, low-key denim looks that still make an impact So, slip into something more comfortable, like a no-frills jean—it’s supermodel-approved.

 If there’s one thing that’s more recognizable than Mariah Carey’s high-pitched “you!” in the chorus of her hit “All I Want For Christmas is You,” it’s her sexy red santa catsuit. Carey first wore the Mrs. Clause-gone-bad, white fluff-trimmed look on the cover of her 1994 Merry Christmas album and for subsequent performances of the iconic holiday jingle. But yesterday, in celebration of the 25th anniversary of the song, Carey released some never-before-seen footage of her very first stage debut of “All I Want For Christmas is You,” and there was not a costume in sight. Instead, the video shows Carey singing the hit inside The Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York wearing a black halter, sharp black trousers, a T-shirt, a skinny crystal-embellished belt, patent leather pointed-toe boots, and a high ponytail cinched up with a thick black scrunchie. Carey shared the video not only to honor catchiest holiday tune in history but also to promote a new double album featuring unreleased recordings from that holiday concert at St. John the Divine. The song itself is timeless, but what was particularly striking about the video Carey shared is what she wore. This clip captures Carey before she became the blinged-out, fur-bedecked diva that she is today. All we want for Christmas? More ’90s-era Mimi style inspiration.

 When it’s cold outside, it can be tempting to just throw on the warmest thing you own—chic or not—and call it a day. But do you really expect a fashion girl to do that? These past few weeks, some of the biggest trendsetters have found fun new ways to wear winter staples. Kendall and Bella have tried on the same winter shoe: hefty lug-sole combat boots. Now, Chloë Sevigny offers a high-fashion take on an even more unexpected piece: ear muffs. Yesterday, the actress was spotted braving the cold in New York City. But she did not use the weather as an excuse to skimp on style: she slipped on a shearling-lined hat that had huge Chanel logos on the ear covers. A quick peruse on the label’s site shows that it is, in fact, a real piece and not a bootleg. It even comes with Chanel’s signature quilting. She styled the designer hat with an oversized leather bomber, straight-leg jeans, socks, and loafers. This is how a fashionista avoids frostbite!

 There’s no question that Normani is a star. Formerly Fifth Harmony’s best dancer, she broke out with her debut single “Motivation” in 2019. Rihanna has clearly taken notice. First she asked Normani to dance at her Savage X Fenty runway show this September—if you missed the footage, please watch it on Amazon Prime Video ASAP. Now she’s signed Normani as Savage X’s first-ever brand ambassador. Chief among Normani’s ambassadorial duties is appearing in the brand’s holiday campaign, debuting exclusively here. Just before heading into a recording session for her new album—yes, it’s coming in 2020!—Normani chatted to Vogue Runway about Rihanna, lingerie, and feeling empowered. What does it feel like to be named Savage X Fenty’s first brand ambassador? I was very excited and really honored, especially that the ask came from Rihanna herself. I know that this is her passion project, something she genuinely and wholeheartedly believes in and cares about, and the fact that she wanted me to be a part of that meant a lot to me. She is somebody I’ve looked up to for a very, very long time. She’s had so much influence on me in terms of pop culture and as a woman, but also in terms of how she’s able to do things gracefully while being cutting edge, being bold, pushing the needle, and changing the narrative. I think that being a part of Savage X Fenty is an amazing opportunity for me to show women that I’m also here for them too. I love how inclusive the brand is. Being a part of the show and being able to have the opportunity to dance and do what I love was so powerful. It was great to be among so many amazing human beings who deserve to be celebrated because they’re all beautiful—all shapes, all sizes. The show represented everybody. I just love how inclusive [the brand] is and how it gives everybody the opportunity to feel sexy and beautiful and empowered—which is everything that I stand for as well. I thought it would be the perfect partnership. The show in September was easily the most fun I’ve ever had at a fashion event. What was the energy like backstage? Honestly, it was the most fun for me too, and I don’t think I’ve been to very many—I can’t even call it a fashion show. It was a full-on experience. It was a concert, it was very artistic. You could feel the energy, it was really infectious. I was really excited to be a part of it. The crowd and the models were supporting each other. What was it like to perform in your lingerie? To be completely honest, that was my first time performing in lingerie, but [the fact that] everybody around me—the dancers, the models—felt empowered really helped. Also the pieces themselves help boost that confidence. Yes, I perform on stage almost every night and performing is something I’m used to, but like I said I’ve never performed in lingerie, so I had to commit. I did have a conversation with myself: OK, all you can do it commit because you are in lingerie in front of people you don’t know! All you can do is really commit because you are going out there. [Laughs.] That’s exactly what I did. I love to dance and I feel like it came from my heart. Rih specifically asked for me to dance, and so I was just really, really excited to be a part of that moment. I feel like it was really revolutionary and really very special. I’m just really excited to watch the growth of Savage X and hopefully continue to be a part of it. What are some of your favorite pieces? I know in the holiday campaign you wear a lot of red lingerie. I think that is actually one of my favorites. Also the pieces that I wore in the show. Her bras—I am a heavy-chested girl and that’s the only reason I was able to go 110%, because I felt supported and I didn’t feel like I was going to come out of everything. Everything is very, very durable, and you can tell that Rih herself and also the Savage team takes time out to make sure it’s the best quality possible. One of the things I like is that the lingerie is very much about being sexy on your own terms. I definitely agree. I feel like it’s not about having to conform and fit whatever the standard definition of sexy is. Rih does a really amazing job of making it universal and having something in the collection for everybody, even down to the way the bra cuts you. I have a hard time, like I said, walking into any store and finding something that I feel comfortable in, but also sexy in, and something that I can also wear all day. I feel like she has done that with Savage X, for sure. So much of your recent work has been about the women and the artists who have inspired you, can you tell me a little bit about the ways that Rihanna has impacted you? Honestly, I think it’s her fearlessness. I think that she has made it sexy to be yourself. I feel like she pushes the needle, she’s always creating her own narrative and helping move music forward. I think that she has empowered women all over to embrace their sexuality as well. She doesn’t shy away from it, I think that’s what we love about her. She’s so transparent with us and unapologetically herself, which is very, very hard, especially as a woman, especially when society tells you what its standards of beauty are and what we’re supposed to be. I feel that she has broken so many barriers, which is something that I hope to do and I’m very, very inspired to do. I think she gives women the opportunity to feel sexy, even on their worst day, you know? She really is writing her own story. There are so many people who look up to you in the same way we look up to Rihanna. What message do you want them to get from this campaign? I want all individuals to feel empowered and to embrace who they truly are. I don’t always wake up the most confident, but I think that’s why Savage X is so important. Being around so many beautiful women and so many beautiful individuals at the show gave me the confidence that I needed to go out there and let my light shine. To the people who see this campaign I would say: Believe in yourself, know that there’s only one you. I wake up not confident sometimes and Savage X gives me the opportunity to feel great, empowered, fearless, and beautiful. So you should definitely cop your lingerie! Also! Do it for yourself, not for anybody else. Last night I wore mine and I was like, “This is real cute just for going to sleep, but for myself!” Then you wake up happy. Exactly. The year 2020 is going to be a huge year for you. What are you most excited about? I sure hope it’s a big year. What I’m looking forward to most is releasing my album. I’m really excited for my fans to hear it because they’ve been very patient with me and they’ve been there since the beginning of my journey—and my new fans too. I’ve been using these new sessions as therapy and as an opportunity for me to know myself in a different way. I can’t wait for everybody else to be able to tap into that and get to know the real me.

 In June, Public School’s Dao-Yi Chow and Maxwell Osborne launched Version Tomorrow, an eco-conscious T-shirt project that produces blank tees made of recycled material. To help relaunch the Vogue Shop, the designers have created three limited edition shirts with a potent message: “Waste not want not.” Chow, Osborne, and Vogue are making this product with the hopes that it will not only spread awareness but also show how high-quality eco materials can be. All of the shirts are made in China from a blend of 60% post-consumer waste cotton and 40% new organic cotton. That material is then dyed using a recycled water filtration system, with the tees cut and sewn in Canada. For their business, Chow and Osborne will sell these tees as blanks, meaning any aspiring designer can buy new tees from Version Tomorrow to screen-print or embellish as they please. “The blank market has become such a big business with the rise of streetwear, but that whole process has been taken for granted. You can’t put the genie back in the bottle, so instead of buying blanks that were made from 100% virgin cotton or ones that are irresponsibly produced or sourced, here’s another option,” Chow says. “We’re not saying that this is it; we’re obviously making more clothes, but the purpose is to offer the option to people who are conscious about it.” All of Version Tomorrow’s tees, including the ones made with Vogue, can be recycled after they’ve worn out their stays in shoppers’ closets. “Each tee can be broken down and put back into the supply chain for us to use as raw materials in the future,” Chow explains. “So we are trying to figure out how we can trace the product and be able to collect the product to be able to use as raw materials for the next batch.” That’s good news for the environment, though if we can say so, the messaging on our Vogue tee isn’t going to go out of style anytime soon.

 Collagerie is a new shopping platform that is the brainchild of London-based editors Lucinda Chambers (above left) and Serena Hood (above right). Their aim: to demystify fashion. Collagerie will showcase a highly curated selection of products at just about every price point (from Rixxo to Jimmy Choo to Mango, for instance), along with styling advice, fashion stories meant to inspire ideas about how to wear what you’ve bought and, perhaps most crucially, instill the sense that the slog of sifting through everything has already been done for you. “We kept asking ourselves,” says Hood, “‘Why isn’t there a very curated shopping platform out there, one that’s focused on the product, that’s beautifully designed—and not in black and white—and without the endless scroll?” I don’t know about you, but I am all for that. With the proliferation of designers, seasons, brands, fashion weeks—deep breath—social media outlets, experiential retail spaces, more digital options to shop—another deep breath—resale sites, and trends (micro or otherwise), fashion can require a degree of dedication and concentration that would get most of us through a PhD program. Meanwhile, there’s you and me just trying to get dressed every morning. Like all the best ventures, it was borne out of personal experience. The duo met at British Vogue: Chambers had been the magazine’s Fashion Director for 25 years, brilliantly adept at using clothes to create memorable images that spoke far more to inner creative narratives than a mere retelling of seasonal directions. Hood, meanwhile, had decamped to London to be the publication’s Executive Fashion Editor after a stint at (full disclosure!) American Vogue in New York. At first glance, their own styles are not at all alike, with Serena putting herself together to a level of glossiness that would look unruffled even coming off of a transatlantic flight, while Lucinda opts for the kind of eclectic and colorful layering that befits one of the trio of women behind the terrific new label Colville. Yet despite the differences, their approach to the conundrum of buying well—and buying right—is the same. “We shop very similarly, very carefully,” says Chambers. “We don’t buy massive amounts of things…. [Collagerie] is like shopping with a trusted friend who has seen it all. When my friend Fiona [Golfar, a writer] is in the middle of H&M, she will think, ‘What would Lucinda buy?’” Collagerie was started with the belief that there are a lot of Fionas—and Lucindas and Serenas—out there. “We’re not so weird and wonderful,” Chambers continues. “We have just as much anxiety about choice. You can have have six tabs open [when you’re shopping online], going from buying a sandal to a lampshade.” Collagerie, incidentally, aspires to show you both—but not too much of either. The launch will, says Hood, feature stories around holiday season party dressing, sustainability, and “a gallery of New York style, very much inspired by my American Vogue days.” A recent version of Collagerie’s homepage  is revealing because of the tight edit—the very opposite of an onslaught of stuff. There was a Celine fall 2019 runway look, a burnished chestnut-brown leather bag, a vintage chair of Danish origin, a vase decorated with a Picasso-esque line drawing of a face, and a chunky strapped sneaker platform, like something the Spice Girls would have worn if Rei Kawakubo had been dressing them. What makes this selection interesting is that a) it looks highly personal, with aesthetic choices driven by emotion rather than material acquisition, and b) everything is presented with equanimity. It’s style first, provenance second. “There’s this misconception that good things have to be expensive,” says Hood. “The things we love… don’t have to cost a lot. It’s about something that lasts—every time you take it out of your closet, you love it as much as when you first wore it.”  For Chambers, Collagerie has to stand for conscious shopping. “I put as much effort and pleasure and thought into buying a dress from Zara as I do from JW Anderson,” she says. “I wouldn’t buy more just because it’s less expensive.” Going forward, Collagerie’s emphasis on the emotional relationship to what we buy will be able to be experienced in real life and in real time, not just on the digital plane. Chambers and Hood are gearing up to do presentations at someone’s home, their office, their hotel—wherever, really—using a modernist graphic screen designed by the interior designer Fran Hickman as a backdrop, along with a mannequin they’ve dubbed “Stella” (likely in honor of Tennant, not Maxwell). That’s if there’s anything left to buy. “We’re already shopping from Collagerie,” Hood says. “There’s nothing we don’t want.” Chambers adds, with a laugh: “It’s rather dangerous, actually.” The latest fashion news, beauty coverage, celebrity style, fashion week updates, culture reviews, and videos on Vogue.com.

 No one has done more for the red carpet sneaker than Kristen Stewart. The actress—who famously broke the Cannes Film Festival’s “no flats” rule last year—likes to pair runway looks with sporty trainers and always errs on the side of comfort. Though Stewart may don stilettos when the mood strikes her, it isn’t unusual to see her kick them off the moment a photo op is over. Such was the case at tonight’s London premiere of Charlie’s Angels, where Stewart arrived in a tartan Thom Browne look from the designer’s Resort 2019 collection. Worn with a leather jacket and a Nike classic Cortez running shoe, the look was an instant win. Stewart and stylist Tara Swennen get creative when it comes to meshing designer pieces with the actress’s signature style, and though she dresses in some of fashion’s biggest names, Stewart maintains an effortless sensibility that amps up every look. With her ever-present Jillian Dempsey lock necklaces, sneakers, and winged black liner, Stewart was in her element. As she posed next to co-stars Naomi Scott and Ella Balinska, who wore dramatic custom fashions from Richard Quinn and Prada respectively, she looked the part of modern movie star—and the sneakers were the icing on the cake.

 Some stars wear their fashions exactly as they were presented on the runway—but Beyoncé isn’t one of them. The music legend likes to adapt each designer’s look to suit her needs, and on Instagram, where she updates her fans with mini-editorials for each outfit, her customizations take center stage. After spending the weekend in glitzy Roberto Cavalli and David Koma gowns while supporting her husband, Jay-Z, at his Sean Carter Foundation Gala in Hollywood, Florida, Beyoncé switched gears yesterday in a color-blocked suit by Lebanese label, Jeux de Mains. Pastel pink and blue with maroon accents, the blazer and matching trousers were striking on their own, but the star elevated them with an unexpected addition: matching opera gloves. Once an essential element of any formal outfit, opera gloves remain a favorite of celebrities and designers. Currently enjoying a runway renaissance—labels like Balmain, Max Mara, and Ralph Lauren all featured long gloves in their Fall 2019 collections—they’re a chic way to stay warm. But Beyoncé’s take went beyond the standard black or white: Perfectly coordinated to her look, the pair helped her carry the color-blocked theme from head to toe. Beyoncé and stylist Zerina Ackers are always in search of the next great trend—and this time, they may have found it.

 Yesterday, Robert Pattinson appeared on Late Night with Seth Meyers in support of his recently released film, The Lighthouse. The British actor sported his signature messy hair—delicately tousled, as if massaged by the nimble fingers of a cherub—and wore a suit. The look was courtesy of Celine and came impeccably tailored: The jacket ever-so-tightly hugged the body, the pants had a diamond-sharp pleat down the center, and the shirt’s collar was freshly starched and firm. The most surprising choice was a subtle one: Pattinson’s tie, which was roughly the width of a (souvenir size) Toblerone bar. While the tie was teeny tiny, it packed a punch. The gentleman’s accessory wasn’t the tie of funhouse mirrors; perversely bloated and worn by sloppy politicians. Nor was it printed with a frightful, cornea-searing print, like a spoof graphic or polka dots. (Quelle horreur!) It wasn’t too short (as beloved by teenage boys going to their first dance) and nor was it too long (as beloved by no one.) Instead, the skinny lil’ thing was comfortably knotted to the neck, hit the tip of the pants, and came with pops of demure red and off-white stripes, a pattern that the label formally describes as “Cambridge striped.” The skinny tie is a piece that is intrinsically connected to Celine designer Heidi Slimane. In fact, Slimane’s love for the ribbon-thin tie during his tenure at Dior Homme defined a whole uniform of scrawny, pokey ribbed, rock ‘n roll dudes (see: Pete Doherty) throughout the early-to-mid ’00s. And while men are choosing more and more to forgo the tie completely—Pattinson himself doesn’t usually wear one—the butter knife-sized piece and its razor-sharp cut has a certain saucy elegance that feels fresh; plus, it can be embraced by both men and women. So relax, make like Pattinson, and loosen up that skinny tie! The latest fashion news, beauty coverage, celebrity style, fashion week updates, culture reviews, and videos on Vogue.com.

 You’ve purchased a reusable coffee cup, you haven’t touched a plastic bag in years, and you can’t remember the last time you shopped at a fast fashion chain. Maybe you even compost! If you’ve been making a serious effort to live more sustainably (or if it’s at least your New Year’s resolution), the holidays are here just in time to throw a wrench in your plans. The sheer variety of people on your gifting list—in-laws, distant cousins, hard-to-please mothers, picky friends—can make conscious and purposeful shopping a difficult task, and that’s before you factor in each item’s carbon footprint or social impact. (Not to mention your budget: If money were no object, we’d all be giving each other hand-knitted alpaca sweaters and recycled diamonds.) But just because you’re crunched for time or lacking ideas doesn’t mean you should resort to dubious Black Friday deals or last-minute Amazon orders. Vogue’s market editor Madeline Fass and I started by putting together a list of our favorite eco-minded brands, and it was well over two pages long. The options are out there! We then narrowed them down to the very best, most gift-able items—and even better, we think your recipients will actually wear and use them. What’s worse than giving (or receiving) a gift that collects dust in the back of a closet? Let’s start with the timeless luxuries: J. Hannah’s sculptural hoops are an artful twist on a classic, and just so happen to come in 100% recycled gold. Gabriela Hearst’s elegant, seriously practical leather gloves will last a lifetime and are produced on the designer’s plastic-free supply chain. Stella McCartney’s nostalgic Fair Isle sweater is similarly trend-proof and is made from merino wool that’s certified cruelty-free and pesticide-free. For cheaper (but no less conscientious) thrills, introduce your beauty-obsessed friends to Kjaer Weis’s reusable lip balm compact or La Bouche Rouge’s refillable lipstick tubes. They’re significantly better (and significantly more stylish) alternatives to the single-use plastic of other products, and neither brand compromises efficacy in the name of sustainability. If you’re in the market for stocking stuffers, you’ll want to order Rentrayage’s hand-embroidered vintage napkins by the armful, ditto Swedish Stockings’s shimmery socks, which are made from regenerated yarns. Shop more gifts to feel good about here—or add them to your own wish list. The latest fashion news, beauty coverage, celebrity style, fashion week updates, culture reviews, and videos on Vogue.com.

 There are certain fashion rules that are now deemed a bit old school, or feel like something only your granny would still adhere to. Think “no white after Labor Day,” or “you must match your shoes to your bag.” But it seems Victoria Beckham is making the case for embracing the latter style commandment, as the stylish designer stepped out in Los Angeles yesterday wearing flawlessly-coordinated accessories. En route to a Jimmy Kimmel Live taping, Beckham made every chic granny proud by matching her ankle-strap shoes to her clutch bag, opting for suedes in eye-popping fuchsia. She then styled the matchy-matchy look with a graphic scribble dress from her Spring 2020 collection—because, as we all know, Beckham always serves as her own best fit model.

 Anitta might be one of Brazil’s biggest stars at the moment—she’s the most streamed artist on Spotify in her native country, and boasts a whopping 42.5 million followers on Instagram—but even as she got ready for the 2019 Latin Grammys, which took place in Las Vegas last Thursday, she still seemed pleasantly surprised by her global success given her humble origins. Anitta grew up in one of Rio de Janeiro’s favelas, and she never imagined she would be singing in other countries, she said, let alone fly on an airplane. Now, though, Anitta let us into her hotel room as she got ready for the awards ceremony. She was not only nominated for her recently released album Kisses, but she also performed a tribute to Cuban singer Celia Cruz at the start of the ceremony, singing “La Vida es un Carnaval.” Anitta multitasked in her hotel room before the show, getting her 1920s-inspired hair and makeup done for the evening while she FaceTimed her dog back in Brazil (she has five of them), before she told the story of how she discovered a long-lost brother. Once she finally slipped into her outfit for the evening—a sparkling silver skirt with a high slit and a yellow satin top that resembles a massive bow, by Lebanese designer Georges Hobeika—Anitta promptly ran out the door to get to the red carpet in time (she hates being late). Here, watch how one of Brazil’s biggest pop stars took on Latin music’s biggest night.

 The early ’00s were a simpler time: everyone simply had to have a bedazzled Von Dutch hat, a Motorola Razr flip phone (which are coming back, by the way), and a Louis Vuitton x Stephen Sprouse bag. The American artist’s collaboration with the French fashion house—where he applied neon, graffiti-style lettering over Vuitton’s monogrammed bags—became something of a craze. Seemingly overnight, all the celebrities started wearing them, and getting your hands on one took desperate measures. (Think: that episode of Sex and the City where Samantha name-drops Lucy Liu to get a Birkin.) But, like all fads, it soon fizzled out, even if they still pop up on resale sites for diehard fans. Now, it seems Kendall Jenner is one of them. The model, spotted in New York City last night, revived the It bag while giving it a very 2019 spin. Her style of choice was a tiny monogrammed pochette with hunter green graffiti overtop; a more subtle choice compared to some of the more electrifying oranges and greens that Sprouse used. (Remember his floral prints, too?) She styled it with an of-the-moment ensemble to update the bag, too, consisting of a leather jacket paired with leather pants, a fitted tee, and square-toe boots (a trending silhouette of the season). So, the next time you shell out for a designer It bag? Hold onto it even when it becomes passé—it’s simply bound to come back in the next decade.

 On any given afternoon in Brooklyn, you’ll most likely find Olivia La Roche on the prowl for all things worn and used. The downtown-beloved vintage dealer is known for hunting down the most rare and special fashion treasures of yesteryear: Think ’90s ostrich-leather Prada boots or John Galliano–era Dior Saddle bags plucked from a thrift store in Bushwick. Over the years, her ability to spot a diamond in the rough has attracted a loyal following to her store, O. La Roche. (It also helps that La Roche, who has quirky-but-sexy personal style, models much of the clothing.) This past summer, the 29-year-old uprooted her bicoastal life to relocate to Rome, where she discovered a cornucopia of designer vintage. “I started coming to Paris every couple of months and started sourcing vintage from there. I saw how much better European vintage is, because things start out there and are better quality,” she says. “I came to Rome randomly. There were two other dealers here who were also working in vintage. They showed me the ropes and we started hunting together.” La Roche spends her time “hunting” at flea markets, thrift, and consignment stores, mostly finding major Italian designers like Versace, Gucci, Fendi, and “loads of Prada,” specifically the label’s ’90s Linea Rossa line. Most of her collection consists of things that Italian houses are famous for: leather, exotic skins, and knitwear. Among the exciting finds: a pair of chocolate leather Gianfranco Ferré booties with metal hardware across the top, a rich cow-print pony hair shoulder bag, or a cropped finely knit tank top. La Roche credits the first-rate trove to the economic boom in Italy during the ’80s and ’90s. “Italian designers were hitting their peak and the older houses were having renaissances. It was also the height of the ‘Made-in-Italy’ history when there was a concerted effort by the government to fund high-quality production here,” she says, adding. “It might actually be the last ‘generation’ of vintage. Not as much was made after that period [’90s and early ’00s] is high-quality enough to survive.” Aside from the main Houses, La Roche unearths smaller, more unknown Italian labels, something that she considers to be the most rewarding experience. “There is such a handful and age-old tailoring history in Italy. There are, of course, the big ones that we’ve heard of in the states, but there is so much more, and sometimes it is even better because [these labels] take more risks,” she says. “They aren’t as established so they are better at experimenting.” Many of her finds also consist of unworn dead stock from defunct Italian designers. One of La Roche’s favorite discoveries was from a thrift store, a dress by Gai Mattiolo, a Rome-based designer who was popular during the ’80s up until the early aughts. “I found this dress and it felt like something special; it had a lot of couture elements. I hadn’t heard of his [Mattiolo’s] name, but I bought it. I discovered that Naomi Campbell was a muse, and I found his Instagram,” she says. “I sent him a picture of the dress and he said it was from the spring 1998 collection and he sent me a picture of it. There was never more than that one made.” While La Roche has successfully been selling yesteryear treasures from Rome back in the United States and beyond, she hopes that the vintage obsession will trickle into the shopping lists of Rome-based consumers. “Like everywhere, there is a lot of fast fashion. I hope that people’s growing interest in vintage encourages that market here,” she says. Until then, snap up your Miu Miu from O. La Roche before it sells out.

 Dua Lipa has a habit of using her promo tour schedule as an opportunity to pull out some full-out fashion. Last year, she took on a press day in a sparkling gown that she could have just as easily worn for at a glamorous red carpet event. And yesterday, at a promo appearance presumably related to her upcoming sophomore album, the British singer was at it again. Lipa headed out dressed in a slick black leather shirtdress that was cut to her thigh, though the main event here had everything to do with her accessories: lime green knee-high boots printed with the distinctive Jurassic Park logo and a matching mini lady bag, both from the Italian streetwear brand GCDS. The car selfie she took en route to making her appearance elicited a flurry of positive feedback, including a comment from Gigi Hadid, the sister of Lipa's current boyfriend, Anwar.  “Yes bby dinosaur,” remarked the supermodel. Maybe Lipa is a big fan of the 1993 Steven Speilberg-directed film, or maybe she’s anticipating the upcoming revival set to come out in 2021, which will star Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, and other actors from the original. Perhaps she was inspired by a recent drive by the La Brea Tar Pits in Hancock Park in L.A., a site famous for its prehistoric fossils (woolly mammoth bones have been found here). Either way, the singer's clearly stepping her primordial-inspired ensemble into the future.

 n the 48-hours since it hit Netflix, The Crown’s third season has already given the world plenty of gifts. Olivia Colman’s understated take on Queen Elizabeth II, Colin Morgan’s meme-worthy hot reporter, and Josh O’Connor’s sympathetic portrayal of Prince Charles currently have the internet buzzing. The series also has plenty to offer off-screen. The lead-up to its premiere yielded a wealth of memorable looks by leads like Colman and Helena Bonham-Carter while introducing the world to a brand new style star: Erin Doherty. In the role as Anne, Princess Royal, the 27-year-old actress is garnering raves for her performance and the elegant looks she has chosen for The Crown’s ongoing slate of premieres and press dates. Doherty first made waves on hit BBC period drama Call the Midwife, but it is her performance as the no-nonsense royal that has propelled her into the spotlight. As the cast has traveled the globe to promote the show, Doherty and her stylist, Fabio Immediato, have relied on fashions that are regal yet modern. At last week’s world premiere in London, that meant a crimson tulle Dolce & Gabbana party frock with a hint of transparency. A special screening for the Screen Actors Guild, meanwhile, called for the chic combo of a dotted silk skirt from Christopher Kane and an off-the-shoulder Altuzarra knit top. Worn with minimal makeup and jewelry, both looks had retro silhouettes and a princess vibe, but Doherty and Immediato aren’t attempting to replicate a royal wardrobe. There’s a playfulness to Doherty’s selections with saturated colors and motifs shining through. Whether it’s a white Valentino gown embellished with tropic-themed embroidery at AFI Fest or this morning’s glittering Tory Burch mini-dress, her choices feel vibrant and fun. Sure, her bold Pucci print blouses and rainbow heels don’t mesh with the palace dress code, but they’re perfect for a rising star.

 Earlier this month, the fashion world caught a glimpse of Vogue and Kith’s second clothing collaboration. Now comes a new addition to the collection, featuring collegiate-inspired pieces like hoodies and a varsity jacket that has just gotten the top model seal of approval. Today in New York City, It model Gigi Hadid repped her Vogue x Kith merch like a top talent should. And considering she’s graced our cover before, it only made sense that she would take things to the next level and transform herself into a walking Vogue cover. From the new line, Hadid chose a varsity jacket—the type jocks wore in high school—that had a glam twist with Vogue’s lettering embroidered across the chest. She styled the cheeky piece with a crop top, classic jeans, rectangular sunglasses, pointed ankle boots, and a neutral leather bag. This fashion moment is a gentle reminder that Hadid is at the top of her game: not only can she land a cover, she can also remind everyone that she did so on the street.

 Even if Alexis Carrington’s looks in Dynasty defined an entire era of fashion, Joan Collins seems bemused when I ask her to describe her style evolution across the decades since. “I suppose I just gravitate towards whatever catches my fancy, it’s eclectic. Why, how would you describe it?” says the 86-year-old actress. “Glamorous, playful, with a bit of sparkle,” I offer. “Sequins! But, of course!” As the star of Valentino’s Christmas campaign, released today, Collins is capping a year in which her love for maximalist ’80s dressing (and sequins) has undergone a renaissance in the fashion world—whether in the power shoulders and eye-popping glitz of recent Saint Laurent and Versace collections, or the resuscitation of labels that defined the era, such as Mugler and Claude Montana. Then, as if to remind everyone who did it first, there was her instantly iconic red carpet moment at the Met Gala in May. With its theme of camp, all Collins really had to do was show up; thankfully, she went the extra mile, wearing a delightfully frou-frou Valentino confection that was directly inspired by her Dynasty costumes, along with a diamond tiara from her own wardrobe. “Pierpaolo [Piccioli] and I went back and forth with designs for about three months—I wanted feathers, but he didn't want feathers,” she remembers. “So I said, I really want feathers! We eventually came to an agreement.” (Needless to say, she wore feathers.) Her relationship with the house of Valentino extends all the way back to the ’60s, when she first visited Signor Garavani’s atelier in Rome. Over the decades, there are plenty of Valentino pieces in her wardrobe that have come and gone. “You can’t keep clothes for decades,” says Collins, firmly. “They just don’t look right.” There is one piece, however, that has stood the test of time. “It’s this beautiful black, shimmery, column chiffon dress I bought from one of his couture shows in the ’80s. I was talking to Valentino a few years ago before I went to some event, and I said, ‘I don’t have anything to wear!’ But he has this amazing memory, and replied, ‘Well, darling, why don't you wear that black dress you bought from the couture show in 1989?’ And I said, ‘Oh my god—you remember that?’ ” Her love of Valentino extends to Pierpaolo Piccioli’s vision for the house, too: The video accompanying the campaign sees Collins ring the doorbell to a Christmas house party in London in a red lace dress, opera coat and gloves, paired with the diamond jewelry she wore to the Met Gala. Greeting the guests in brilliantly pithy style—“I see it’s not just the Champagne that’s flat,” she quips with a raised eyebrow—things are instantly livened up with a spot of Collins-led dancing and a stack of gift boxes from Valentino’s Dante-inspired holiday gift collection. It seems fitting that Collins would opt for one of the label’s more classic designs, given her timeless sense of style. On the subject of the ’80s style revival, she observes that it’s never really gone away. “I think that the flamboyance of oversize earrings and ill-fitting skirts might have gone—skirts never fitted properly in the ’80s, by the way—and the huge curly hair might have gone, too. But the sleek style that I wore a lot in Dynasty, the pared-back suits but with definitive shoulders and small waists and embellishments of color and jewelry, I think smart women have been doing that through the decades.” She does, however, mourn the days when dressing up for the day was more of an event. “I really hope that people will spend more money on clothes, because nobody dresses up anymore. If you do, then people stare at you, or make cutting remarks…well, maybe not cutting, but they’ll say something like, ‘Oh, look at you! You’re all dressed up.’ I find that very sad, because it will be the end of women buying elegant clothes in stores. Everybody’s going to end up in jeans and T-shirts, which I think is tragic.” How does she respond if someone makes a comment like that to her? “Thank you,” she says, drily. This move toward more casual dressing has created a very specific bête noire for Collins. “I hate jeans. I hate them, they’re so unflattering. And I hate jeans with holes in the knees, or holes anywhere. I’m not keen on T-shirts with logos, either. I like to be comfortable, but I want to be elegant, too.” It’s something that she particularly struggles with in her adopted hometown of Los Angeles, where she has lived since the mid-’50s. “I don't really fit in with the L.A. lifestyle, because everyone's in T-shirts and jeans, and I don’t like that look. Oh, and neither does Valentino, by the way. Mr Valentino is always exquisitely dressed, which I love.” In those sunny Californian climes, she admits it feels strange to already be getting in the festive spirit with a Christmas campaign, meaning she’s not yet ready to start thinking about gifts for the holiday season. “I haven’t really got to that, but I mainly try to tailor the gifts that I’m giving to people to the individual.” As for what’s on her Christmas list this year? “I have so much, I can’t really ask for anything. But I love to read, so I love to get an interesting biography that hasn’t been in print for a while, or a beautiful art monograph.” For those lucky enough to have Collins on their Christmas gifting list: get buying.

 No one does outerwear like Ariana Grande. When it comes to fashion, the pop star prefers consistency—Grande keeps her ponytails high and her heels even higher—but a rotating array of statement coats and hoodies allows her and her stylist, Law Roach, to experiment with the latest trends.  Yesterday in New York City, they offered their take on extreme volume with a casual outfit anchored by one of Virgil Abloh’s Louis Vuitton Menswear puffers from the Fall/Winter 2019 collection. A logomaniac’s dream, the quilted gray jacket took the classic monogram into plush territory. On the runway, towering male models made the piece seem typical, but on Grande’s petite frame, its statement potential was revealed. Giant, grey, and wrapped around her like a cocoon, it was far from the ordinary topper. Paired with white sweatpants and high-top sneakers, the jacket kept Grande cozy as she went for an after-hours walk with her dog, Myron, who she dressed in a festive dog sweater. The star, who complimented her monochromatic look with furry grey earrings and a lengthy ponytail, retained the playfulness she’s become known for. This borrowed-from-the-boys piece added yet another layer to Grande’s signature look.

 A chic lady bag will never go out of style, particularly by luxury labels such as Chanel (the quilted flap) and Hermès (the Kelly or Birkin). But just because carry-alls have a timeless, dressy feel doesn’t mean one has to style it that way. Yesterday, Kendall Jenner was spotted leaving a shoot in New York City, where she put a grungy twist on a classic bag—call it a downtown take on an uptown accessory. Her top-handle of choice? A sprightly yellow Hermès Kelly bag, which offered a bit of warmth on a winter day. But she didn’t pair it with a chic LBD or suit; instead, she matched its color to a graphic hoodie, styling it with brown trousers, Velvet Canyon's Zou Bisou sunnies, and punky Doc Martens boots (a chunky silhouette that’s shaping up to be the shoe of the season). So, the next time you’re feeling sticker shock about investing in a lady bag? Just know that you can wear it however and whenever you want. Kenner knows that, at the end of the day, you make the rules—and you can break them, too.

 Last week, the Charlie’s Angels remake was released, starring Kristen Stewart, Ella Balinska, and Naomi Scott, to critical and commercial disappointment. While the franchise’s newest incarnation failed to make any major impact, the original film from 2000, Charlie’s Angels, still stands as a classic. Starring the trifecta of Drew Barrymore, Lucy Liu, and Cameron Diaz, the character archetypes were cut and dry. Liu was the slick, worldly one in a tight leather skirt suit that carried a whisper of the dominatrix. Barrymore, meanwhile, brought her bohemian personality, sleeping with a man (played by her former fiancé, Tom Green) who lives on a tugboat. And Diaz, as in most of her roles at the time, would continue to be the beaming girl next door, just with a little more punching and jaw-breaking. Charlie’s Angels was filmed at the height of Diaz’s career. This blockbuster was action-packed, with plenty of huge explosions. Diaz kicked bad guys to the curb in halter tops, low-slung leather pants, and black stiletto boots. There were funny moments too! Who can forget the scene when Diaz wakes up in her sun-drenched room somewhere in Los Angeles, gyrating in a pair of boy’s underwear to the tune of Tavares’s disco classic “Heaven Must Be Missing an Angel”?  In her Vogue May 2003 cover story, Diaz’s costar Lucy Liu said of her character’s wardrobe: “For Cameron, it’s an art form, and it’s all about transformation and change—like turning a skirt into a tube top. Something could cost $10 or $10,000—either way, if she’s comfortable in it. She makes it work. She defines her own fashion, and people follow it.” Diaz and her Charlie’s Angels character’s wardrobe were a match made in heaven. In fact, they seemed like they belonged to the same person, off- and onscreen—and that’s because they basically did. Liu’s observation about Diaz’s chameleonic take on fashion was surprisingly on point. Over the years, Diaz, a three-time Vogue cover star, has perfected a more laid-back approach to the over-the-top, early ’00s style. There was plenty of unwearable excess during the post-Y2K years, but Diaz packaged its flashy, bare-belly antics in a more palatable way. As in Charlie’s Angels, her costumes onscreen were never too far from her everyday, off-duty outfits. In 2002’s The Sweetest Thing, her character’s wardrobe is a “girls just wanna have fun” dream. (It is the premise of the movie, after all.) She wears a heavy rotation of thigh-high boots, midi skirts with showy slits, and a barrage of useless but pretty mini scarves. There are off-the-shoulder tops in fuchsia. Metallic flares that are so tight, they appear painted on. All things cropped. Several layers of cherry red lip gloss. Her character as a New York–based crazed lover in Vanilla Sky, released one year before, was a little more pared-back but in a similar vein—just take the scene featuring Diaz’s signature booty shaking in caramel-hued leather pants. Before her mercurial rise in Hollywood, her off-duty style had mainly consisted of elegantly pared-back outfits that weren’t dissimilar to those of her peer, Gwyneth Paltrow. She was a fan of all-black sexy shiva-sitting looks—a turtleneck or a slip skirt—but toward the late ’90s, Diaz’s personal style began to feel both more carefree and more attainable than Paltrow’s big-money minimalism. You could see Diaz’s personality poking through. She’d add a kicky high red shoe to a black pant, show a bit of shoulder, or maybe wear a necklace that felt like it was pulled from a surf shop. She was fun. She wore lots and lots of jaunty hats. Even if she wasn’t someone who lived or died by fashion trends, it was clear Diaz loved getting dressed up. On the red carpet, Diaz also displayed that innate flair for playful fashion. Throughout this period, the actress was styled by sisters Clare and Nina Hallworth—known within Hollywood circles as “the twins”—who speak highly of Diaz’s fashion knowledge to this day. “Cameron was a collaborator. She was always open to mixing designers. She looked beautiful in clothes and she was a pleasure. Cameron was ahead of everyone,” they write. “She wore what felt right.” The duo put her in several of her most memorable looks, including the Emanuel Ungaro Haute Couture kimono dress she wore to the Oscars in 2002—a look that is now considered ahead of its time, but landed Diaz on several worst-dressed lists. Almost 20 years later, it seems Cameron’s style couldn’t look any fresher. In that same 2003 Vogue cover story, the writer also notes Diaz’s knack for mixing and matching designers like Stella McCartney and Alexander McQueen with her own pieces, like an antique necklace that she styled as a belt or a “pair of hippie-chick jeans.” The Annie Leibovitz “she can do it all!” fantastical circus-themed shoot featured Diaz wearing a hand-painted silk and chiffon blue Dior Haute Couture John Galliano gown. The final touch? A pair of Uggs from her own wardrobe. It’s an anecdote that perfectly captures the offbeat, high-low take on fashion that makes Diaz’s style feel relevant today. Truly, she could do it all. The latest fashion news, beauty coverage, celebrity style, fashion week updates, culture reviews, and videos on Vogue.com.

 Erykah Badu clearly revels in creating alter egos. She is, after all, the queen of nicknames—aside from Ms. Badu, you can call her Badulla Oblongata, Sara Bellum, Analogue Girl in a Digital World, or Manuela Maria Mexico, to name just a few of the monikers that she goes by. Now, though, Badu is introducing a new persona into the mix. She took to Instagram earlier today in a plaid jacket and moss green bucket hat to declare herself Autumn Annie. While she looked ready for the crisp weather, this was no ordinary fall costume. Badu finished off her look with a pair of towering red patent leather heels. Leave it to Badu to add some kinky flair to an otherwise modest outfit. Who knows what else Autumn Annie has in store over the next few weeks?

 These days, it seems there’s a new rumour every week that the cast of Friends, the beloved ’90s sitcom, is reuniting. Could we be more excited that Rachel, Monica, Phoebe, Ross, Chandler, and Joey are potentially getting back together to hang out in Monica’s unrealistically-large New York City apartment? Recent sources say the six cast members are on board to bring the show back, but whether that’s happening or not, there’s one thing that’s definitely worth reviving: Rachel Green’s chic ’90s style. The iconic character, played by Jennifer Aniston, and her wardrobe embodied the sleek, minimal aesthetic of the decade that still resonates today (both on the runways and the streets). All the It girls—Bella, Gigi, Kaia, Emily—have been channeling Rachel-esque outfits, which are heavy on the leather blazers, cool denim, slip dresses, and turtlenecks. Plus, as winter arrives, it’s the perfect time of year for all of us to take a leaf out of Rachel’s style playbook. A few highlights to imitate that still feel current? How about when Rachel flirted with her assistant at Ralph Lauren in a green turtleneck tank and plaid skirt—a polished work look that feels perfectly of the moment in 2019. Another 9-to-5 combo is her all-black suit, paired with a tortoise butterfly hair clip (those are back, too). Simply lounging around at home? Do like Rachel with a cute plaid mini skirt, knit sweater, and knee-high tube socks—a cute ensemble that’s ready for a night in watching TV (and to greet the delivery man with your takeout). Below, shop six of our favorite Rachel Green-inspired looks. The latest fashion news, beauty coverage, celebrity style, fashion week updates, culture reviews, and videos on Vogue.com.

 The response to the sale and imminent closure of Barneys New York has been mostly emotional. Designers are sharing memories of their very first Barneys meetings; New Yorkers are reminiscing about their favorite Barneys splurges; and everyone is mourning the loss of New York’s most beautiful, discovery-filled retailer. There are plenty of other department stores (and former Barneys competitors) up and down Fifth Avenue, of course, but the Barneys experience was singular. “To me, it was the mecca of fashion, where you could go and find eight floors of the most relevant designers,” Nili Lotan, one of those designers, tells Vogue. “There’s no store like it in New York, or anywhere in the world. The curation is something you won’t find anywhere else.” Designers like Lotan are grappling with more immediate issues than where the fashion crowd is going to shop, though. She recently finished production of her Resort 2020 collection, including a very large Barneys order set to deliver in early November (i.e. last week). But when rumors of the retailer’s bankruptcy and potential closure circulated earlier this summer, she began to worry what would happen to all of those clothes if they never made it onto the floor. “I was waiting for everything to be resolved, and was hopeful that Barneys would find a buyer or investor, and my collection would be shipped, and I would be paid,” she says. “But as we got closer and closer to the court date, I knew I had to cover myself. If Barneys didn’t find the right buyer, then all of my production from Resort would have nowhere to go.” Her instincts were correct. Completed on November 1, the sale to Authentic Brands Group stipulated plans to close the majority of Barneys stores, let go thousands of employees, liquidate the remaining assets, and license the Barneys name to Saks Fifth Avenue. The people Lotan worked with at Barneys are no longer employed; that large order they had placed for Resort 2020 was never paid for, and thus not delivered. Saddled with “a tremendous amount of product,” Lotan found a swift solution: She opened a temporary store just a few blocks away. Over the course of two weeks, her team spruced up the space at 715 Madison Avenue, brought in some artwork, and opened the doors. “I had all of this product and didn’t want to have to sit with it and put it on sale, and wanted to show it in the most beautiful way,” Lotan says. “It’s already bringing in a lot of new clients from the neighborhood, but a lot of thought also went into where our [former] Barneys customers are going to go. Maybe they’re going to Net-a-Porter, which is my second biggest distribution. We do extremely well with Nordstrom. I’m presenting the collection to a few other New York department stores this week, because for so long we had to be exclusive with Barneys.” The store’s exclusivity deals were infamous, barring designers from selling to Bergdorf Goodman, Saks Fifth Avenue, and other big-name competitors. Lotan likely isn’t the only designer enjoying the silver lining of exploring new wholesale relationships. Still, she’s most interested in growing her own direct-to-consumer business: “I’m opening more stores this year, and I’m growing my website, so I’m not concerned,” she says. “I have a very strong business right now. I’m established. But what I’m most [saddened by] is that the young designers starting out won’t have a store like Barneys that gives them the opportunities they gave me. They supported you even if you weren’t a huge brand, and helped you become a huge brand.” Irene Neuwirth’s business is wildly different from Lotan’s—she’s a fine jewelry designer who deals in one-of-a-kind stones and five-figure pieces, and she isn’t beholden to rigid seasonal ready-to-wear schedules—but her path forward post-Barneys looks similar. The store’s closure marks the first time in 18 years Neuwirth has been able to meet with other department stores, but she’s also focusing most of her attention on her own stores and e-commerce. She relaunched her website last week, and says her Melrose Place store—which looks more like your dream home than an actual store—“does amazingly well, better than Barneys.” Still, she chalks up much of her success to the retailer’s support, particularly Judy Collinson [then the executive vice president].  “I was looking at our brand bio the other day, and I was like, ‘should we update this?’” she says, laughing. “It’s really centered around Barneys. I think a lot of people rolled their eyes about having to be exclusive with them, as did I over time, but it was so helpful to me for many years—it helped me learn about my business, and it pushed me to make another really good decision, which was opening my own retail store and investing in e-comm. When all of this imploded, I felt really wonderful that I had that.” In fact, Neuwirth began “tightening up” her business with Barneys nearly a year ago when she became wary of its financial situation. “It’s been headed that way for a while. We haven’t shipped to them for the past five months, so our exposure was not as scary as it could have been,” she says. “They’ve always owned our pieces [as opposed to consigning them, a standard practice in jewelry] and they still own some. But what they have is selling really fast.” Neuwirth has been taking meetings with other retailers, but it’s difficult to compare the department store experience to that of her dreamy shops, where her staff are part of the family and every detail has been hand-picked by her. “I have such an extreme attention to detail, and I felt like over time, I’d go into Barneys and other smaller boutiques I worked with, and the jewelry looked beautiful, but it wasn’t telling the full story. So I always wanted to create that, and it’s just been the best. I think everyone should do it if they can.” Neuwirth and Lotan’s paths reflect a greater trend of designers investing in their direct businesses and scaling back wholesale in an effort to enjoy better margins and, more importantly, create a unique experience. Women shop in Nili Lotan’s store because they appreciate the spare decor, the black-and-white photography, and the wide assortment of cargo pants, cashmere sweaters, and blazers; Neuwirth’s customer comes for the whimsical jewelry and stays for the cozy, art-filled environment. Still, there’s something to be said for what Barneys once was: a true department store with deep variety, designers you’d never heard of (yet), and the very best of everything under the sun, from skincare to homeware. “I think this is a good opportunity for department stores and retailers to change things up,” Neuwirth says. “Everyone will just need to get with the program. I met with someone the other day who said this old-school conservative way of doing business just needs to go, and they wanted to look at jewelry in a fresh way.” She’s been taking meetings with all of the top retailers in New York, but likely won’t sign more than one account. “Our business is doing just fine if we take Barneys off the books,” she says. “I have to fall in love with whoever we decide to partner with.” Lotan isn’t backing away from the wholesale model, either. Her collections are stocked at Net-a-Porter, Shopbop, Elyse Walker, and Nordstrom, and will debut at Barneys rival Bergdorf Goodman next week. “My business in wholesale is growing so fast, and I’m growing my own stores, so I’m not concerned,” she says. “Hopefully someone else will do what Barneys did, whether it’s in the same location or somewhere else. When I started my business in 2003, I had no representation on Madison Avenue, so women got to know me from Barneys. I shopped there all my life. But let’s see what happens, and be positive and hope something good comes out of it.” The latest fashion news, beauty coverage, celebrity style, fashion week updates, culture reviews, and videos on Vogue.com.

 On Saturday the second edition of the Latin American Fashion Summit concluded in Cartagena, Colombia, with a designer competition. Maygel Coronel, who makes luxury swimwear, won the $10,000 prize. The four-day conference and networking event is the brainchild of Estefania Lacayo, a Nicaraguan New Yorker with 17 years of experience in the fashion business, and Samantha Tams, a retail specialist. They launched the project in 2018 to help Latin American creatives and entrepreneurs who had previously had little to no access to the industry’s international decision-makers. With the promise of panels, workshops, and dinners at home, Lacayo and Tams lured the likes of Carolina Herrera, Francisco Costa, entrepreneur Carmen Busquets, jeweler Ana Khouri, MatchesFashion.com’s Natalie Kingham, and Colombia’s own rising star Johanna Ortiz to the summit, and 600 attendees participated. Busquets and Herrera spoke about the Latin American fashion boom and what it takes to make it on the global stage, and Costa joined Mexican Vogue’s Karla Martinez de Salas to discuss his new beauty project Costa Brazil. Lacayo’s personal highlight came during the welcome event. “Everyone went around the room saying hello, and at one point 15 children stood up and introduced themselves as students from Honduras who were in attendance thanks to the sponsorship programs we developed with NGOs and private family offices. It’s this type of inclusivity that’s one of our main missions, and to see it come to life was truly special for us.” Here, Lacayo and Tams share other highlights from the four-day event.

 Today, Prince William and Kate Middleton took in the Royal Variety Performance together at the Palladium Theatre in London, England. The event supports the Royal Variety Charity, of which Queen Elizabeth II is a patron; and for their night out together, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge went for coordinated looks that embodied timeless glamour. Middleton chose one of her favorite designers for the evening occasion—that being Alexander McQueen, the Sarah Burton-led label that designed her wedding dress. This latest creation was a vampy black lace design, with a floor-length hem, long sleeves, and a sweetheart neckline (a departure for the Duchess, as the look’s darkly romantic undertone sits outside her usual aesthetic). She then accessorized it with dangling Erdem earrings and her favourite shoe, a classic pointed pump by Jimmy Choo. To complement his wife, Prince William chose an understated tuxedo that hit all the right notes: a crisp white shirt, just-right bow tie, and a classic pair of black oxfords. This latest perfectly balanced couples look? Consider it yet another winning fashion moment for the stylish royals.

 Last week, Emily Ratajkowski released a miniskirt suit from her label Inamorata; within two hours, the look had nearly sold out. (She’s already announced on her Instagram that she is currently working to restock more.) The viral set includes the Los Feliz blazer, an oversized jacket that reaches a tad below than the hem of the matching high-waisted Vista skirt. There are four colors: burnt orange, camel, black, and baby blue (the latter was the first to sell out). Ratajkowski modeled the drop herself on her Instagram with typically bold styling, going sans bra and sans shirt. It’s all very Ally McBeal—if Ally McBeal was a little less uptight. Ratajkowski created the Instagramable, saucy set after not being able to find a skirt suit that she liked. “I love suits, I love bathing suits, and I also got married in a suit,” she says. “I’ve actually been wearing tons of blazers this fall. I couldn’t find the exact suit I wanted, which was this miniskirt moment with an oversized blazer, as if it was a twist on a classic. It makes getting dressed easy. Our motto is ‘Look chic, be hot,’ so this is an easy, natural extension of it.” Of course, she isn’t the first to push the miniskirt set: On Ratajkowski’s mood board were a series of classic images, from the supermodel-beloved tweed miniskirt sets in Easter egg hues from the Chanel spring 1996 collection to Cher Horowitz’s sassy foot-long skirts and blazers from Clueless. While Ratajkowski has appeared on her Instagram wearing the full set, she’s also a fan of mixing and matching the pieces. Most recently on Instagram, she posed with her husband Sebastian Bear-McClard wearing the black incarnation with a blue Online Ceramics hoodie. “They were designed as a set, but I’ve also been loving breaking them up and wearing them with chunky sweaters and tights and big jeans,” she says; to the office, Ratajkowski wears them with a pair of sneakers. While the skirt probably doesn’t follow the standard “fingertip rule”—the classic dictum that calls for the hem of a skirt to reach at least three inches below the fingers—Ratajkowski doesn’t believe in adhering to stuffy dress-code rules. The miniskirt fits into the model-actor’s philosophy of wearing what one wants, when one wants. “My friend was saying to me that wearing what you want to wear is a test. If someone doesn’t take you seriously, that isn’t a person you want to work with anyway,” says Ratajkowski. “For me, because it is such a micro mini, there is something a little ‘fuck you’ about it. We have all been in situations, like, ‘Is this appropriate to wear?’ I like the idea of wearing the type of suit that I want to wear without having to worry about whether it is offensive to anyone.” Spoken like a true businesswoman.

 A winter shoe is possibly the toughest accessory to nail. It needs to be practical, water and slip-resistant—and it needs to look cute, too. (Duh.) And while fall’s footwear offering is all about chic knee-highs and slouch boots, those can be too precious to wear in the midst of a snowstorm. But fear not! Kendall Jenner just stepped out wearing the ultimate winter-ready boot—and it’s already shaping up to be a major trend with other stylish celebrities, too. Spotted in New York City yesterday, the model hit the streets in Prada’s lace-up combat boots with extremely chunky lug soles. The hefty shoes offer much-needed grip for navigating the city in slushy conditions, but also added a dash of edge to her ensemble, which consisted of a streamlined blazer, graphic turtleneck, classic jeans, and her most-worn accessories: Velvet Canyon's Zou Bisou sunnies and a ’90s-style shoulder bag. But it was her punky shoes that were the standout—having already been worn by other trendsetters such as Bella Hadid, it’s clearly shaping up to be the must-have boot of the season.

 She’s back! Since traversing the globe for her Becoming book tour and leading the Obama Foundation’s summit back in October, Michelle Obama has kept a low profile. The former First Lady chooses her appearances carefully—but last night, she stepped out at the National Portrait Gallery’s Gala to celebrate composer, actor, and Hamilton scribe, Lin-Manuel Miranda. In a shocking yellow gown from Schiaparelli Haute Couture styled with subtle diamonds and her hair in soft waves, Obama was a picture of glamour, standing alongside Miranda as they posed in front of his portrait by photographer Mark Seliger. The gala demanded a dynamic look, and Schiaparelli’s creative director Daniel Roseberry’s design was appropriately unorthodox. Inspired by Elsa Schiaparelli’s affinity for vibrant color and couture-level construction, he sought to create a gown that could stand out while complementing the first lady’s personality. “The acidic tone echoes Elsa Schiaparelli’s signature shocking pink, and we also felt that it matched the strength and energy of Mrs. Obama. It was such an honor to make this special gown for her,” shared Roseberry via email. “The inspiration for the shape originally came from the crinoline, which is often found underneath couture gowns, but the real starting point for the overall look was the color.” The arresting shade and jeweled bodice may have stolen the show, but for Obama, the night was all about Manuel and his extensive contributions to culture. Post-event, she praised him for his creativity and commitment to philanthropy. “I first met Lin more than a decade ago, when he came to the White House to perform the opening number from what he described as a “concept album.” And, as we all know, his little concept, Hamilton, became a global phenomenon,” she wrote on Instagram. “What I love most is that he believes it’s his duty to lift up those around him, especially the next generation.” The latest fashion news, beauty coverage, celebrity style, fashion week updates, culture reviews, and videos on Vogue.com.

 This weekend, Harry Styles was both the host and musical guest on Saturday Night Live in New York City. The singer, who is gearing up for a world tour in support of his upcoming album Fine Line next year, performed his single “Lights Up,” as well as a new song, titled “Watermelon Sugar.” Aside from the comic skits and musical performances, however, Styles also pulled off a fashion tour de force—and it was all about embracing his trademark retro sensibility. The Gucci-filled night began with his opening monologue look. The singer, who has a penchant for flamboyant suits, went for a more pared-back style, though it still had plenty of his signature details, comprising of a double-breasted blazer with a blue silk shirt and yellow wide-leg trousers. Styles has been rocking the ’70s-style flared pant a lot lately, and clearly it’s a trend he’s sticking with. Then, as the show progressed, the looks got progressively bolder, with Styles wearing two further looks that continued on his strong suit game. One fit, in head to toe red, featured modern updates on suiting up, such as oversized lapels and a silky polo shirt in place of a classic button-up. His final winning ensemble? A black sequinned jumpsuit with a plunging V neckline, complete with a cross necklace and tons of chunky rings—a statement look that undeniably stole the show.

 Harry Styles might have won your heart—and convinced you to buy a Sex T-shirt and some Sara Lee Bread on Saturday Night Live this weekend—but according to Lyst’s Year in Fashion index, Timothée Chalamet is the most influential man in fashion. The annual report tracks search, social media, sales, and news, ranking designers, brands, and fashion-world stars for a snapshot of the year’s biggest trends. According to the 2019 report, Chalamet was the second most influential celebrity—Meghan Markle was number one—with Zendaya, Billie Eilish, Cardi B, Kylie Jenner, Lisa from Blackpink, Lizzo, Billy Porter, and, yes, Styles rounding out the top 10. What makes the actor so important? Experimental styling—remember his mid-layer garment?—and a penchant for new brands like S.R. Studio LA. CA., for starters. Then there’s the fact that Chalamet doesn’t use a stylist and develops each of his red-carpet looks himself. That authenticity resulted in a 192% spike in searches for men’s hoodies after he wore a sequined black one from Louis Vuitton to the premiere of The King. Even more astounding, his Venice Film Festival ensembles, mostly by Haider Ackermann, resulted in an 806% increase in searches for the designer. (The love is mutual: Ackermann calls the actor “beloved Timo bro” on Instagram.) No other celebrity tracked by Lyst, not even Markle, created that much interest in a designer this year. With great power comes great responsibility, of course, but Chalamet seems up to the task of being menswear’s most visible champion. He continues to ply the boundary between traditional masculinity and femininity, often choosing slim, soft tailoring over traditionally bold cuts. He can also wear a blouse better than almost anyone—and will do so willingly if his Ackermann tops and Entertainment Weekly cover are any indication. The best news, though, is that before the clock ticks to 2020, we will be blessed by another Chalamet film and press tour. Little Women comes out on December 25; expect some of the actor’s best looks yet.

 When Rihanna tackles a trend, she takes it to the next level. The musician-turned-mogul likes her fashions extreme—so when revisiting the logomania look of the early aughts this weekend, she did so with gusto. Stepping out for dinner in Los Angeles on Saturday, Rihanna wore a series of Christian Dior pieces covered in the brand’s classic oblique jacquard print. Her bucket hat, slip dress, and anorak were all adorned with the interlocking Ds, and she doubled up on the statement bags to push the look even further. With the iconic saddle bag worn crossbody, and a mini-version of the book tote in her hands, she was a walking advertisement for Dior’s attention-grabbing logo. Of course, Rihanna and Dior go way back; since becoming the first black woman to serve as a Dior ambassador back in 2015, she’s often incorporated its signature monogram into her wardrobe, wearing accessories covered in the familiar print. But his weekend’s more exaggerated version of the look proved that classic patterns always resonate, whether they’re on a purse or splashed from head to toe—in her monochromatic monogram, Rihanna ensured all eyes were on her.

 Shininess was at a premium last week, at least for the world’s most stylish. No little black dress was complete without bejeweled embellishment. Consider Emilia Clarke’s ruffled Prada party frock at the premiere of Last Christmas or Zendaya’s belly-baring Christopher Esber look for the People’s Choice Awards. And then there was Valerie Pachner’s bejeweled gown by J W Anderson: confident, glitzy, and cool. Elsewhere,  metallic shimmer from head to toe ruled the carpet. Ever the risk-taker, Kasey Musgraves gave the CMAs a fashion moment in canary yellow, marabou feathered Valentino. In Thom Browne’s deconstructed power suit, Karolina Kurkova clashed silver and gold to great effect. For Celine Dion the world is a runway, and in pleated silver lame Rodarte, complete with an Elizabethan ruff, she delivered the most dramatic of the seven show-stopping looks from her 2-day New York jaunt. Of course, there’s always more than one way to shine. In black and white polka dots at the Latin Grammys, Rosalía showcased the power of a graphic print. Her sassy, trained dress by Wes Gordon for Carolina Herrera enabled the rising star to make a spectacular entrance.

 Who has the best hats in the biz? We’d have to go with Kerwin Frost and Tyler, the Creator, given the adorable Instagram the pair posted after recording the season finale of Frost’s podcast, “Kerwin Frost Talks.” Always willing to embrace a good color clash, Frost opted for a slouchy black and purple striped beanie paired with with a green varsity jacket and plaid pants. Tyler, meanwhile, went a preppier route—sporting the divisive (but very much on-trend) baker boy cap with a herringbone blazer, and, for a more outré touch, a pair of shorts. When it comes to Tyler, the Creator, business casual is truly business casual. Speaking of business, for those seeking a new officewear option, get ready to be suited and booted by Emily Ratajkowski. The model-actress-swimwear designer has just released a set of miniskirt sets; in hues of black and ice blue, she’s been modeling them on her account throughout the week. You’re going to have to wait to buy one, though—it seems the buzzy pieces have already sold out. On another continent, the Russians have been getting very glam on the ’gram this week. Beloved Muscovite Olga Karput (of the concept store KM20) cozied up in a blanket by designer Nina Donis, while actress Renata Litvinova posed on a staircase at the historical Bashmet Center in a striped Dior number. And, speaking of Dior, Bella Hadid has managed to make loungewear oh-so-glamorous with a little help from the storied French maison, cozying up to a puppy while wearing a bathrobe that emblazoned with “Dior Backstage.” The only question is where can we purchase one? As in, the robe and the dog. Here, see the best fashion Instagrams of the week.

 A solid winter wardrobe should start from the bottom, up. When it’s too frigid for dresses and too cumbersome to layer tights under jeans, only a serious pant will do. But versatility is key. You need the kind of trousers that will carry you from icy commutes to overheated holiday parties. Whether it’s wool pants that are perfect for the office or lounge pants that you can wear out on the weekend, we’ve found the essential pairs that will keep you cozy all winter long. Below, shop 36 of the best pants to slip on for your chicest winter yet. Time to give your work dress pants a seasonal update. Trade chinos, khakis, and crepe pants for warm wool styles. Wide-leg or loose-fitting wool trousers are key to office dressing this winter, and come in classic herringbones and speckled wools, and even an ‘80s pleat. Easily pair these styles with your go-to blouses, blazers, and work shoes during the work week, and easily slip into them once again for the weekend. The evening pant is the perfect alternative to a special occasion dress—especially when it comes to getting ready for multiple holiday soirees. Think black trousers piped with diamanté crystals or equipped with feather-fringed hems. Or how about metallic and jacquard dress pants in the season’s festive color palette? The best part: Unlike a statement-making party dress, you can rewear evening pants again and again with a little creative styling. One idea? Show off a decorated T-strap pump with a cropped flare pant and a chic sweater and you’ll be set to celebrate until the New Year. Holiday dressing has never been easier. During summer we have gingham, but for fall and winter, there are checks, plaids, and tartans, too! The print feels undoubtedly seasonal and works seamlessly with the rest of the cold weather wardrobe, lasting you from the first pumpkin spice latte to the final snowfall of the season. Plaid pants can be dressed both up or down as well. Consider tucking a pair into heeled knee-high boots and topping it off with a turtleneck for Thanksgiving dinner. Or bundle up in a parka, wooly socks, and a pair of snow boots for a wintry weekend getaway. Nothing looks cooler and is more functional than a pair of heavy, durable leather pants. Prevent cold air from getting through to your legs in a protective layer of patent. Leather trousers are the season’s best kept secret when it comes to looking stylish, staying warm, and shielding yourself from the elements. Take the leather pant as your date for a night out this winter — you’ll be sure to turn heads at every holiday soiree or dinner party. When it’s too cold for stiff, non-insulated jeans, try a pair of reliably cozy corduroys. In multiple silhouettes for every body type and personal style, a corduroy trouser can be a simple swap for daily denim. A straight or wide-leg black pair would fit seamlessly into the modern woman’s wardrobe, while a snow white flared pair would make for the ultimate après ski look. The winter season is full of a seemingly endless amount of traveling and eating. In the end, the key to great winter style is being comfortable. Luckily, this season’s evolution of slouchy, stretchy, and knit loungewear can actually be worn both in and out of the house. Pack a pair of flared black leggings when heading home for the holidays. Cashmere or knit pants have the power to make traveling and running errands look effortlessly chic, while printed leggings can be both a stylish layering piece or suitable option for Christmas morning.

 Charlize Theron takes a very particular approach to high fashion: The Oscar-winner’s wardrobe may come directly from the runways, but she and stylist Leslie Fremar are always keen to put their own twist on a designer look. Case in point? Last night at the Guggenheim International Gala, where the actress offered a fresh way to wear Dior, arriving at the museum in a delicate black lace and mesh gown from Maria Grazia Chiuri’s Spring 2020 collection paired with a black biker jacket. A clash of styles is nothing new—when the dress debuted back in September on the runway, it was paired with an anorak—but Theron’s rock ’n’ roll remix offered a more unexpected take on the piece. Part of the reason is that the look was reimagined specifically for Theron, with the Dior ateliers putting in more than a hundred hours of workmanship to take the concept from sketch to reality, and ensure it meshed perfectly with its wearer’s style. “The back had an amazing cross detail, and the neckline was traced on her body to hit the exact right spot,” says Fremar, who credits Theron with the idea of adding the leather jacket as another layer. Initially pulled for a separate outfit, it caught the actress’s eye immediately. “Charlize fell in love with the jacket,” says Fremar. “She asked if we could try it over the gown, [and] it felt appropriate for the weather to be covered.” With New York currently in the middle of a deep freeze, the choice was pragmatic—but that doesn’t make the look any less cool. Here, an exclusive look at the creation of the piece, from the first sketch to the final dress.

 “It looks like nothing, but it’s everything,” says Jean Touitou. “It does look like nothing,” finishes Justin Saunders. Last night, Touitou, the founder of A.P.C., and Saunders, the mastermind behind JJJJound, the Montreal-based design collective, came together in A.P.C.’s balmy Mercer Street store to discuss their new “interaction”—read: collaboration—which consists of pure, simple, minimal pieces like a sweatshirt, sweatpants, jeans, a tee, a tote, a candle, a notebook, and a hat. The products were released online and in A.P.C. stores yesterday, and almost everything has already sold out, thanks in part to the hoards of people that gathered, rapt, to hear Touitou and Saunders in conversation. The ivory sweatshirt Touitou and Saunders were talking about—the one that looks like nothing—is the result of almost two years of intense study. Saunders is a research obsessive who can recite on a dime the weights of his fabrics, the precise color of a dye, and the exact length of a seam. It’s his furious hunt for perfection in design that put him on Kanye West’s radar during the early pre-Yeezy years, around the same time Touitou and West were collaborating on collections, and it was through West that Touitou and Saunders met. In Saunders, Touitou says he sees a bit of himself. “At some point I proposed to him to do an interaction because he shares so many aesthetically and even moral and political values with us,” the A.P.C. founder said the day before the event. There’s also the fact that as A.P.C. has grown from being a label-free collection of essentials into a more global brand serving up everything from daisy-print dresses to leather brogues, Touitou has become just slightly envious of Saunders’s smaller scale and freedom. “I’m envious in a good way,” he clarified. “My vision of A.P.C. has not changed at all, it’s just that we grew up. When one has 78 stores and maybe 350 wholesale accounts, one cannot spend three weeks focusing on an off-white sweatshirt for it to be perfect. This is why I said I was envious, because at the beginning of A.P.C., obviously, I would spend hours and hours and hours to understand what the twist of a yarn was, the proportion, the structure, the length, the molecules of the cotton. This is where I get envious because I can see he does all that. I can feel it.” There’s irony in Touitou and Saunders joining forces to create these perfect pieces. “The perfect tee” has become a direct-to-consumer buzzword to justify the existence of zillions of brands taking shots in the dark at what makes a good crewneck. Since 1987, A.P.C. has been selling just that, even if Touitou won’t admit that his collection of basics is probably as close to platonically perfect as a jean or tee or knit could get. “One thing is perfect, though: The quality of the denim we use. The fabric,” he finally conceded. Saunders referenced much of the brand’s extant designs for the project. “We gave him carte blanche, and the thing was that he went über A.P.C. He wanted to go to the core of A.P.C., and so I was very happy that he came to the roots of the original design. It’s a good refreshment, a good reboot,” said Touitou. Back in the A.P.C. store, the audience was asking philosophical questions: “How do you know when something is done?” And do Touitou and Saunders see themselves as reformists or radicals? Big stuff for a talk about a sweatshirt about nothing, but that’s just how Touitou likes it. One-on-one he explained, “There are only one or two mediums that can reflect the complexity and the contradiction of our world: that is literature and philosophy. What we do in fashion and what I try to do at A.P.C. is to give some sort of dignity, some sort of an attitude. You know, one has to have clothes anyway. One has to live under a roof anyway, so you might as well design the clothes and you might as well design the house. I’m not going to say we are going to change the politics of the world, going wild, but we are doing our part in trying to be as good as we can.” A.P.C. Interaction #4 JJJJOUND is available at A.P.C. stores and online, Mr. Porter, and End.

 “Fun, but still wearable.” That’s a succinct descriptor of Harley Viera-Newton’s highly collectible, vintage-inspired dresses, but it also applies to her new capsule of bags, earrings, and pajamas debuting for the holidays. In addition to her vast collection of ’50s-era tea dresses and ’60s-ish printed midi frocks, Viera-Newton has an “infamous” cache of itty-bitty vintage bags—none of which are particularly suited to 2020, seeing as that they don’t hold a phone. “My friends are always teasing me about my bags, so when I told them I wanted to design my own, they said, ‘Let me guess—they’re tiny,’” Viera-Newton says. “But I compromised, and they do fit a phone!” For proof: The DJ-slash-designer carried the “quilted” clear resin bag to her launch party last week, and if you zoom in on the photo, you’ll notice the iPhone 11 Pro Max tucked inside (with room to spare). Like her dresses, the bags and jewelry were designed to fill the holes in Viera-Newton’s closet. “HVN has always been driven by pieces I want but can’t find, or vintage pieces I’d like to update [for today], and I thought it was really difficult to find an evening bag that actually goes with everything,” she explains. Of course, aside from her sequined numbers, most HVN dresses aren’t what you’d consider “evening.” Her best-selling Morgan dress takes its cues from ’40s day dresses, with a little collar and ruched sleeves, so Viera-Newton designed the resin clutches and chainmail shoulder bags with more casual moments in mind, too. “I’m a magpie, so I’m always drawn to glitter, sequins, rhinestone, chainmail,” she says. “The bags fit really well into the existing HVN aesthetic, but I think they’d work just as well with denim.” The same is true of her first earrings: a pair of chunky rhinestone hoops, which have already been spotted on Margot Robbie and Selena Gomez. Viera-Newton’s Instagram reveals the many ways she herself has worn them: with a quirky sweater for ramen in Tokyo, with a black gown and heels on the red carpet. “They just immediately add a fun element to any outfit,” she says. “But I’m hoping every item in the HVN world is something you’d want to invest in, because it still has a timeless quality. I’m never looking to design anything too trend-driven, or something that will go out of style.” The earrings (priced at $145) and bags (starting at $375) will be available on Net-a-Porter and HVN’s website starting Monday, and will surely go fast now that holiday parties are in full swing. In the meantime, you can pick up Viera-Newton’s other new category: ultra-soft pajamas in her signature cherry and cheetah prints. “I’ve done silk pajamas in the past, but silk is so much upkeep,” she says. “I wanted to recreate them in a cozier, easier fabric, and since I moved to Los Angeles, I’ve been able to explore all of the options for downtown manufacturing. We found the perfect modal jersey, which is the coziest thing ever.” They’re priced at $175. Should you choose to splurge for Net-a-Porter’s same-day delivery (and pick up a new dress while you’re at it), you could feasibly spend the whole weekend in HVN. Shop the current collection now, and bookmark your calendar for Monday’s drop.

 Who doesn’t love Casual Fridays? Whether it’s the opportunity to spy on your coworkers’ latest designer steals, or simply the chance to show off that fabulous Hawaiian dad shirt you bought on vacation, a relaxed dress code always brings out the office’s sartorial best. It seems that Casual Fridays are firmly not on Victoria Beckham’s agenda, however. Arriving at Paris’s Gare du Nord this morning to attend the Vogue Fashion Festival, Beckham delivered a take on power dressing that was both on-trend and ready for the boardroom. Dressed in a grey wool two-piece with an ’80s-style gold chain belt from her Spring 2020 collection, she paired the suit with a pussy bow shirt covered in a handwritten print, before topping it off with a crimson corsage. Finally, a purple croc Hermès Birkin and matching pumps gave the look an artful dose of clashing color. It’s safe to say that Victoria Beckham looks good in just about anything. And by regularly sporting the latest looks from her recent collections, Beckham serves as her own best billboard. Why wouldn’t put her most stylish executive foot forward even as the weekend approaches? To paraphrase Dynasty’s Alexis Carrington: she owns 51% of this company! If you're looking for reasons behind her singular approach to style, then this 73 Questions interview from 2015 might hold the answer. When asked why she rarely smiles in photos, her response was simply: “I’m smiling on the inside. I feel that I have a responsibility to the fashion community.” We can only assume that responsibility extends to dressing up to the nines on Fridays, too—and we wouldn’t have it any other way.

 If you find yourself sporting an all-black or dark colored uniform deep into the winter months, you’re not alone—just take it from this pack of street style stars, all photographed in their versions of the go-to seasonal look. And who can blame them? Dark colors are simple, chic, and often make up the majority of the coloring (or lack thereof) of the winter gear you’ve purchased over the years, whether it’s coats and sweaters in shades of grey, or boots and bags in brown or black leathers. For the sake of practicality—unless of course, you’ve shopped Vogue’s guides to puffer jackets or faux furs already—dressing in dark colors is a good way to play it safe while still looking put together. After all, you wouldn’t want an expensive coat to dirty easily, nor would you want to get bored of a statement piece you’re committing to wearing all season long. There is one simple way to brighten things up, however, especially once those tireless winter outfits start to feel dull or drab—and it starts with last-minute outfit adornments. A brightly hued shoe or bag adds a pop of color to any and every winter look effortlessly, with no additional thought required. If we’ve picked up one trick from these seasoned street style stars, it’s to save that pop of color for last. Try swapping trusty black winter boots for a stompy pair in bright red, or recover spring’s pastel bags from storage and carry them all winter long. A dose of color goes a long way, and certainly shouldn’t be limited to any specific season. Here, 11 of the best and brightest accessories to try this season, from candy clutches to brilliant boots—this assortment of shoes and bags are sure to be the remedy for the winter blues.

 Hiatus? What hiatus! Rihanna may be taking a well-deserved break, but don’t expect her to just disappear. The beauty and fashion mogul will always come out to support her peers, and at last night’s premiere of Queen & Slim, she did just that. Directed by Melina Matsoukas—whose prolific small screen career included music videos for Rihanna’s songs “Rude Boy” and “Hard”—and written by Lena Waithe, the film is buzzy enough on its own, but Bad Gal Riri’s presence at its AFI Fest debut in Los Angeles added an extra touch of Hollywood sparkle. Rather than pull something fresh from the runway, or even wear a creation from Fenty’s latest drop, Rihanna and her stylist Jahleel Weaver went old school, sourcing a classic John Galliano look from London boutique, William Vintage. After all, the black silk kimono from his Spring/Summer 1995 collection is a piece of fashion history. Originally worn by model Marie Sophie-Wilson during one of the early runway shows that helped cement Galliano’s reputation, it’s exactly the kind of dramatic, one-of-a-kind fashion Rihanna appreciates (and knows exactly how to give a fresh spin). Accessorized to the hilt with diamond and onyx chains and a minuscule clutch, the look was red carpet magic—almost as thrilling as the events onscreen.

 As the holidays draw nearer, many are contemplating what exactly they’ll wear to the countless parties, dinners, and cocktails that coincide with the season; thankfully, Celine Dion is already providing plenty of inspiration. The music legend has been on a roll this week while visiting New York City, turning up in one vibrant runway look after another—an impressive style streak that culminated with last night’s chic (and very festive) Tom Ford suiting from the designer’s Fall 2019 collection, that she wore while exiting her hotel. Dion’s crimson velvet blazer and matching satin trousers were elegant, especially when accented by a maroon turtleneck and The Row’s understated It bag, the Ascot. Velvet suiting has been a Tom Ford signature as far back as the Gucci days, and Dion’s version shows why it remains so desirable. A head-to-toe style statement that feels relaxed yet refined, Ford’s tailoring is a failsafe way to dress up without losing comfort. Ever the quick-change artist, Dion has already worn a glittering silver Rodarte gown and Roland van der Kemp couture in the hours since her Tom Ford moment. Still, her comparatively simple suit was the cherry on top of a series of memorable looks.

 This past Tuesday night, David Lynch, Nicole Kidman, Naomi Watts, and other cinema heavyweights came together at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City to honor Laura Dern. Chanel presented the annual fundraiser for the permanent collection’s film acquisitions, and the French house also dressed the surprise performer of the evening: Maggie Rogers. Rogers has been on a covers kick as of late—just a few weeks ago, she joined Dead and Company onstage at Madison Square Garden to perform “Friend of the Devil” and “The Weight”—and she reached even further back into the American songbook with her MoMA performance. Along with Jon Batiste and Rogers’s guitar player, Elle Puckett, Rogers sang her own rendition of the George Gershwin–penned jazz standard “Someone to Watch Over Me.” Rogers took to the MoMA benefit stage in a flouncy black belted Chanel number, naturally—see below for a behind-the-scenes look at her night, and look out for her surprisingly bookish red carpet accessory. So many options! Thank you Chanel for helping me look my best for the MoMA Film Benefit honoring Laura Dern. Getting ready. Shoutout to queens Linda Gradin, Lizzie Arneson, and Kat Typaldos. Glam 4evr. Red carpet look. Onstage look. Wingardium Leviosaaaaa. Red carpet essentials—yes, that is a tiny Faulkner. Are you even surprised? On the way. I live for these fancy fonts. The incomparable Laura Dern. I mean, that photo—can you even? Nothing makes me happier than performing with my friend, the inimitable Jon Batiste. We worked up a special cover of “Someone to Watch Over Me" for the night. Thank you to Jon Batiste and my guitar player, Elle Puckett, for joining me. Ciao!

 Dolly Parton will never turn down a bit of sparkle, and that seemed especially true at the 53rd annual Country Music Awards last night in Nashville. Parton had five outfit changes over the course of the proceedings. She started off the night in a plunging Jackson Lowell cream-colored cocktail dress overlaid with some elaborate black beading fashioned into the silhouette of a harness. The other looks were custom costumes that she cooked up with her creative director of 29 years, Steve Summers. “I always joke that I never leave a rhinestone unturned,” Parton says. “I have to have sparkles on my clothes. It makes me feel vibrant. Shoot, even my pajamas have rhinestones on them!” In addition to performing a medley of faith-based songs in a fringed white gown later on in the show, Parton also acted as a special guest host alongside Reba McEntire (Carrie Underwood hosted the event as well). “Everyone needs a little more light and love, and that’s what I wanted the performance to be,” Parton says. “I love sharing these beautiful, uplifting songs with the world!” Follow Parton as she gets ready for country music’s biggest night, below—it’s even glitzier than you’d imagine.

 Congrats to Kaia Gerber and Pete Davidson who have taken their buzzy relationship to the next level: They are now upstate official. After being photographed canoodling at a New York City diner in late October, the pair has fled the hectic, grime-filled world of the Big Apple. The model and the comedian are vacationing in Hillsdale, New York, a quaint, rustic town filled with all the charming things quaint rustic towns have: fragrant bakeries, organic farms, and the luxurious illusion of feeling off-the-grid. But there are no off-the-grid moments for Davidson and Gerber: The two were captured exiting a supermarket holding hands in low-key looks. Gerber wore a slick black leather jacket, a striped yellow top, dark-wash jeans, and black sneakers, and topped off the down-to-earth ensemble with a white beanie. Davidson kept his outfit even more casual, braving the cold in a lone blue sweater with a white T-shirt peeking out, even darker jeans, and a pair of black Converse. (The crowning accessory here was Davdison’s ear-to-ear smile that was so wide, it was reminiscent of a euphoric Cheshire Cat inhaling all of that clean upstate air.) Sartorially, the two are obviously comfortable with one another! Gerber and Davidson’s budding relationship has roots in the fashion industry. It is rumored that they met at the Alexander Wang’s Spring 2020, which they both walked. (That was Davidson’s runway debut: He strut in a black beanie, a white tank top that showed off his heavily tattooed arms, and a pair of low-slung leather pants.) Since then, the two have been spotted out and about in New York City, including last week when Gerber was seen attending Davidson’s Brooklyn podcast taping. But as for this out-of-town outing? It is a bridge between the casual and serious stage in a relationship. The act of “going upstate” is not as easy as taking an Uber to visit the other person, and yet, not as intense as taking a flight together. It involves clocking miles, lodging, and being happily trapped under the same roof for several days. And it also involves multiple wardrobe changes! On that note, let’s see whether Gerber or Davidson will offer up any more impressive fashion moments from their romantic getaway.

 Ah, stuck with the task of getting a gift for someone you don’t know all that well? It may be the most daunting holiday challenge, more than finding a present for your 25-year anniversary with a spouse or for a picky teenager. For example, what do you get your coworker, the friendly one whom you admire and run into en route to the bathroom once a day? Or your just moved-in, very sweet neighbors with the sick, yowling cat? (Or is that a crying baby? After all, you really don’t know them.) Maybe you have to figure out the right tchotchke for a relatively new boyfriend’s parents whom you’ll soon meet at a holiday party for the first time. For those truly delving into the unknown of gift giving, sticking to the basics will work in your favor. Think: kind gestures that are nonaggressive, noncommittal, and sans heavy emotions. For instance, try a pack of chicly wrapped soaps because, well, they are pretty and smell nice. (And hopefully, the recipient washes his hands from time to time.) Also, you can’t go wrong with tableware. Most people use plates and cups. Spice up their cupboard with Edie Parker’s tortoise coasters or something from Richard Ginori’s new collaboration with artist Luke Edward Hall. Dare to go to the next level when it comes to gifting a stranger? That calls for being a bit more thoughtful and attentive. Maybe your charming deskmate is on a health kick? If you’re feeling extra generous, buy her some healthy snacks from Dada Daily and a cheeky hand candle to go with them—be aware though, only four fingers have wicks, so when it melts only the middle finger remains! And if she has several candles near her computer? Try a chic (and cheap) matchbox from John Derian. And when all else fails? Everyone loves—and, of course, needs—good socks.

 Young designers are often told to carve out a specific niche, but Helena Bajaj-Larsen’s background is too wide and her ambition too large to be hemmed in by conventional wisdom. The 24-year-old textile designer is based between Paris, Dubai, and Mumbai, and her work draws on at least three cultures. The textiles she creates—based on traditional Indian natural fiber “khadi” fabrics—are used for a collection of refined ready-to-wear and home goods sold under her eponymous label. The fabrics are dyed and painted by hand for a multidimensional effect that calls to mind abstract expressionism. Those who own her streamlined trenches and exquisite abayas say they feel like they are wearing a piece of art, and that’s precisely the vibe Bajaj-Larsen is going for. In the age of mass printing, there are quicker ways to complete a pattern, but she believes that the creative deep dive necessary to produce her textiles results in a more original product. “[It is] like fabricating the skin of a garment cell by cell. You are composing an image using color, line, pattern, and you get to decide how you create a balance between these elements,” she shared via email from Paris. “It feels like a meeting place between fashion and art in the most literal sense.” Bajaj-Larsen grew up with art. Her mother is the acclaimed painter Sujata Bajaj and her father, Rune Jul Larsen, is a Norwegian academic. Raised in Paris, she has been immersed in cultural life since birth. “While most of my friends would go to the countryside over the weekend, our family activities would consist of gallery openings, art fairs, previews, [and] studio visits,” says Bajaj-Larsen. “I was without fail always the only kid in the room but quickly developed a fascination for all these creative individuals or ‘characters’ as I liked to call them, each more interesting than the next: the clothes, the stories.” A meticulous planner, Bajaj-Larsen studied every aspect of the fashion industry before she entered it. Her research on design schools led her to Parsons. While there, she completed an embroidery internship at Mary Katrantzou and moonlighted as an assistant with other fashion houses. “It helped me understand just how much I wanted to focus on fabric development within my work.” She continued her textile studies at Central Saint Martins in London during a semester abroad. “I didn’t even make a single garment that semester, [it was] all surface design work,” she says. Selected for the CFDA’s Fashion Future graduate showcase prior to her graduation in 2017, Bajaj-Larsen was then handpicked for a design fellowship with Donna Karan’s Urban Zen and Rihanna’s Clara Lionel Foundation once she completed her studies. The collaboration saw her working in conjunction with local artisans in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, to create collections of home goods. Both experiences gave her the chance to interact with some of fashion’s most influential creatives from Fern Mallis and Sara Maino to the Dutch trend forecaster Lidewij Edelkoort. “I have been blessed to have met multiple industry veterans who were kind enough to take the time to sit down with me and look at my work,” says Bajaj-Larsen. “They all seemed to agree there was another realm to explore using the same creative identity: something beyond the somewhat restrictive scale of ‘fashion design’ in a traditional sense. I look forward to seeing how this will manifest itself in the future. Who knows, perhaps the brand will be a surface design studio catering to multiple fields.” At present, Bajaj-Larsen is busy with her latest collection, a forthcoming furniture collaboration, and plenty of orders from private clients. Her versatility has already opened up a lot of different creative paths. “At this stage, I am open to anything and am trying to be as diverse as possible in the projects I take on,” she says. “Hopefully, this is how I will continue to learn new things and grow the brand in a steady, sustainable manner.” “I would get frustrated with the prints and fabrics available in stores when I was sourcing for college projects. Everything looked the same. The colors didn’t have enough depth, the patterns felt endlessly repetitive: geometrics, animal, florals. I would pick up these pieces and try to alter them as much as possible through various techniques, be it embroidery, paint, laser cutting, etching, appliqués, fusing.” “It starts with yardage—white silk laid out on long tables, 20 meters at a time. Acid dyes come first; we make a crazy amount of batches, the likes of 10 reds, five browns, 10 yellows, 10 oranges. I am a bit nutty when it comes to color variants. The more there are, the greater the depth of the print, so I make sure not to compromise on this. The tools that are used encompass spades, brushes, sponges, sprays—this also allows for a more varied and richer outcome than if we used one method.” “After this the fabric goes for steaming, washing, and drying. The second round begins as the material is pinned back onto the tables—then the details are added in black and gold and silver pigment paints. Just a few strokes here and there. This allows me to highlight aspects of the print and also add texture as the pigment lines have a different feel on the fabric. There is definitely a science to all of it, but it is an incredible process that I fell in love with over the years.” “I still make every fabric and there is no digital printing or screen printing involved—each piece is a one-off, and my hope is that the client will view it as a collectible item they cherish rather than acquiring yet another garment. The attention to detail is what is most unique to the brand; each inch of the piece is ‘visually calculated.’” “I started designing jewelry on the side when I was in my last year at Parsons as part of an elective—it was one of my favorite classes and became a space of relief from the uber-intense thesis environment. In terms of design, I use the same approach as I would with a piece of fabric. By this, I mean the shapes are simple and it is all about surface work—lots of different techniques are applied, be they overheating, etching, hammering, reticulation, granulation.” “It starts with a single slab of metal (mostly sterling silver), and then slowly as we play with it and land on a texture we like, we then take the slab and bend it into a minimal design: cuffs, earrings, rings, neckpieces. Far from dainty, they are more like body sculptures—very raw and highly experimental. I didn’t intend for it to evolve into anything necessarily. Still, later on, it became an integral part of the brand as the response to the product was overall very positive.” The latest fashion news, beauty coverage, celebrity style, fashion week updates, culture reviews, and videos on Vogue.com.

 It was Valentine’s Day 2010. Judy Garland began to warble over the soundtrack in the Lexington Avenue Armory and Marc Jacobs and his business partner Robert Duffy stepped out to tear away cardboard paper from a wood frame box. Behind the cardboard were his models, hair mussed, black eyeliner carefully tracing the outer-corners of their eyes, and streaks of highlighter on their skin. Just one season earlier, they had been vampish ballerinas; before that high-haired Princess Glorias; and before that Arabian Mary Poppinses. Few can create a collection of characters quite like Marc Jacobs—check out his Spring 2020 outing for the ongoing proof—and yet for Fall 2010, Jacobs put pizazz on the back burner in favor of a soulful, simple collection of timeless wardrobe basics. Inside that giant wooden box were 56 models in varying shades of gray, greige, beige, sky, and lemon-lime dressed in iconically quirky Jacobs shapes. Tati Cotliar opened the show in a gray knit sweatshirt that, from the front, looked perfectly normal, and from behind revealed itself to be backless, harnessed with a sexual subversion. Jacobs’s bracelet-sleeve coats were worn with midiskirts, socks, and mary janes, and models super and street cast sported voluminous fur collars or bookish glasses. Long before the idea of everyday essentials became a direct-to-consumer buzzword, this was a collection that presented wooly coats, tea dresses, and three-piece suits as anything but boring. And then there was the eveningwear: Enormous shearling gilets with velvet pants, prairie dresses that dripped in muddy sequins, Jenny Sinkaberg in an Oscars-worthy red carpet column worn with a shrugged on chartreuse mock neck. It was Jacobs’s wallflower glamour at its bizarre best, a palette cleanser that still resonates today. “I got tired of the whole idea of modernity and what’s new in fashion, so we just kind of revisited a lot of our old stuff,” Jacobs said backstage. The shapes he revived for Fall 2010 might have been antique at the time, even more so today, but damn do they look right for this season. The good news is many of these pieces will have a second (third, fourth, fifth) life on sites like TheRealReal and Vestiaire Collective. Happy hunting!

 This season, the focus is on utility jumpsuits, cargo pants, and more industrial-feeling pieces, all of which add a rugged feel to an outfit. Think something you’d see on a dusty construction site—only paired with cuter bags and shoes. (No steel-toe work boots allowed.) Someone who’s on board with the look is Bella Hadid. Today, the top model was spotted in Paris taking the trend to the extreme. Hadid wore a head-to-toe cargo look by the notable newcomer Reese Cooper that calls for a game of, “How many pockets is she wearing?” She began with the designer's knitted zip-up vest in hunter green, which had three large Velcro pockets on the front. She wore it over a simple black long-sleeve tee by Local Authority. Her black high-waisted trousers also had a ton of cargo pockets. She offset the bulkiness with a more minimal shoe: sleek white low-top sneakers by Nike. Though she had more carrying compartments than one person needs, she still slung a tiny shoulder bag over the shoulder—her signature accessory, along with her Matrix-style sunglasses and gold hoops, of course.

 Katie Holmes has been the year’s fashion breakout star. The actress has been serving polished, on-trend outfits throughout the summer and fall seasons. She is often spotted on the streets of New York dressed as though she is heading to a Fashion Week event (even though she is actually just running errands). So is it any surprise that she’s also nailed the art of travel? Yesterday, Holmes touched down at the airport in Sydney, having ditched comfy flight sweats in favor of a bolder, western-inspired look. The actress chose to fly with her favorite label of the moment, Khaite, the brand that went viral after she wore its cashmere bra and cardigan set this summer. This time around, Holmes chose the label’s suede Jimmy jacket with layered fringing. She styled the statement piece with a classic white tee and straight-leg denim. To give her country look more of a fashion feel, she then piled on the sleek accessories: pointed pumps, a structured leather tote (also by Khaite), gold necklaces, and tortoise sunglasses. An international jaunt has never looked so good. When you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.

 As of late, the biggest celebrity fashion moments haven’t been happening on the red carpet. Instead, stylish stars have been candidly serving up looks on the city streets—with their adorable dogs in tow, of course. Model Emily Ratajkowski kicked off the dog-walking style craze with multiple sightings in New York City; she’s pulled off everything from a full Maryam Nassir Zadeh runway outfit to a more casual tank dress by her own label, Inamorata. And now, Jennifer Aniston is putting a more Californian stamp on the movement, too. The Morning Show actress stepped out with her loyal pup Clyde this week, sharing an image of their walk together on Instagram. “Girl’s best friend...bring Clyde to work day,” she wrote in the caption. Aniston wore a printed, body-hugging dress with puffed sleeves and ruching at the waist—a chic garment for getting one’s steps in. She accessorized the look with hoops by Jennifer Meyer, strappy sandals by Christian Louboutin (you think she’d wear sneakers? Think again), and cool round shades to go incognito. So, looks like there’s officially a new fashion-forward dog walker in town. Jennifer Aniston Said the Friends Cast Is Working on Something Together Jennifer Aniston Is Making Sleazy Sunglasses Chic  Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux’s Post-Breakup Friendship Warms My Heart So, We Might Finally Be Getting That Friends Reunion Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon Serve Up Throwback Beauty at “The Morning Show” Premiere Jennifer Aniston Has a Brand New Show, But Her Dress Is Pure Vintage The latest fashion news, beauty coverage, celebrity style, fashion week updates, culture reviews, and videos on Vogue.com.

 In the pitch black of the Roxy Hotel’s basement movie theater, a single phone lights up. Its screen flashes a series of bright images: Chiara Ferragni outside, inside, and on the hotel’s step-and-repeat in a butter yellow Prada feathered ensemble, crystals punctuating the corners of her eyes like Maddy on Euphoria. We’re sitting in silence watching a new documentary about the blogger, Chiara Ferragni: Unposted, an audience of other influencers, friends, family, and press brought together by Amazon, which will release the film internationally on November 29, following its premiere in August at the Venice Film Festival. The iPhone continues to light up with images of Ferragni, a red-tipped finger flick, flick, flicking at the screen for several more seconds before it goes dark again, not to be woken up until the credits roll and the audience booms with applause. The next day, that series of images appears on Ferragni’s Instagram with a caption punctuated by the heart-eyes emoji: “Last night was another milestone for me: the documentary about my life @chiaraferragniunposted premiered in New York in an intimate celebration between friends and people I love. I can’t wait for you guys to all watch it from November 29th on @amazonprimevideo.” In the grand scheme of things, you really can’t criticize Ferragni for looking at pictures of herself on her phone during the premiere of her documentary, because she is her business. Her face, her outfits, her thoughts, everything that comprises and represents her sense of self; being the best at being Chiara Ferragni is what she does professionally—and damn, is she good at it. “I always say I’m a digital entrepreneur,” Ferragni tells me at a press junket the next day, where she is surrounded by a team of managers and assistants I recognize from a scene in the film in which The Blonde Salad Crew—a multi-part company that oversees Ferragni’s fashion collection and editorial site and also represents other influencers—meets in their Milan office. “When we started talking about making the documentary, it was very important to show the business part because I feel most people, even if you follow me 100% every day, don’t really understand what I do. Even in the documentary, you can’t understand 100%, but you can get a better idea of all the different things that my team and I do. It’s not just about taking photos and looking pretty, because if it was like that, everybody could do it, you know? It’s really about working hard, compromises, sacrifices, and having good intuitions, having good instincts. It’s a mix of a lot of things, but it’s not only taking photos.” Still, her expertise at sharing and being shared is the crux of the film, which has been directed by Elisa Amoruso. Over the course of 85 minutes, we follow the 32-year-old Ferragni to fashion shows, events, and even—in the film’s opening montage—to a Los Angeles piercing salon where she winces as a technician pierces her right nipple. That’s as shocking as the movie gets, much of it instead centering on her childhood, which was captured on VHS by her mother. It’s these family movies that Ferragni credits with helping her find her voice. “The way that I started to tell my own story on social media, it’s very similar to what I used to say on camera to my mom when I was a child. Even when I was younger, I wanted to be in the spotlight—at that time it was my mom’s spotlight. I’ve always wanted that, I’ve always cared for that. The documentary just made me see things in a different perspective.” It’s been 10 years since Ferragni launched her blog, The Blonde Salad, and the documentary dutifully marks how far she has come since then, using early videos, blog posts, and selfies to illustrate her journey. It proceeds from seeing a young Italian woman dancing on a chair in her modest kitchen, law school books splayed on a small table, to watching her marriage proposal in front of a crowd of thousands of people. According to the documentary, Ferragni’s 2018 Sicilian wedding to Fedez—an Italian pop star, né Federico Leonardo Lucia—was more popular online than the 2018 nuptials of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. To further illustrate Ferragni’s influence, the documentary contains interviews with Delphine Arnault, Maria Grazia Chiuri, Diane von Furstenberg, Paris Hilton, Jeremy Scott, Silvia Venturini Fendi, Alberta Ferretti, and more fashion-world fixtures. The industry approval, the 17 million Instagram followers, the young men and women that scream and weep in her presence, and the fact that Harvard Business School used her as a social media case study cement Ferragni as one of the internet’s most valuable moguls. She’s also one of the most clever. At the film’s premiere, Italy’s Consul General to the United States introduced her to the audience, making a pointed connection. “I think that Chiara Ferragni runs deep in the historic Italian tradition of creativity. […] She combines, at the same time, a capacity to be an entrepreneur, an influencer, a producer, a designer. I think these are all features of the Italian Renaissance, to be many things together at the same time,” he said. It’s interesting timing that while certain corners of the world are anguishing over a different Renaissance woman—you know, the one with the three-quarter profile and mind-blowing smirk whose new position in the Louvre has caused a media uproar on par with Brexit and the U.S. impeachment hearings—Ferragni is redefining what it means to be a renaissance woman circa 2019. Ferragni, though, appears to have outsmarted the old masters in the sense that she requires no external inspiration. Being L’insalata bionda is to be both La Gioconda and Leonardo da Vinci, to be both the muse and the maker. (There was a darker time in the past where Ferragni maybe have been in a more traditional muse/maker relationship. The documentary briefly touches on Riccardo Pozzoli, Ferragni’s onetime paramour and business partner, who reportedly tried to sell his shares of their joint company The Blonde Salad Crew in a coup before conceding and selling them to Ferragni, making her the company’s CEO and sole owner.) Indeed, she is so self-sufficient in telling her own story, she says that seeing the documentary was weird. “It was like looking at myself, but looking at it from somebody else’s perspective. That is something that has never happened to me before. It was kind of like a revelation.” The idea of doing it yourself, making your dreams real, is integral to Ferragni’s success and what she wants to inspire in others. During our whirlwind interview, I asked her why she thinks people like to follow her on social media. “I hope it’s because I’m very honest, very transparent, and I think, hopefully, I can be a good example,” she begins. “Seeing that I succeeded, they can get a source of inspiration or a source of energy that tells them: ‘I should try it as well.’ That’s the most powerful thing.” She pauses. “I’m happy because I’m proud of the person that I am and I’m happy that people can see that and find it inspiring in their own way.” Towards the end of the film, this level of happiness causes Ferragni to break down into stilted tears. She’s emotional because if she’s this happy now, well, that must mean it will go away soon. The scene abuts another of her and Fedez walking with their son, Leone, in Venice Beach, California, as they discuss taking a sabbatical to briefly settle down. The conversation goes back and forth, unresolved. Still, you get the sense they will #NeverStop, as Ferragni’s old Instagram bio used to read. “But how long can she do this?” a colleague asked me about Ferragni. Surely there must be an expiration date on selling oneself? Maybe not. This spring, Ferragni will appear on Amazon’s new fashion competition series, Making the Cut, as a judge alongside Heidi Klum, Naomi Campbell, and Joseph Altuzarra. “I hope to keep doing those sort of projects because they are challenging, and I love to be challenged. I love to do something that I haven’t done before just to prove to myself [that] it’s okay to be scared, I can do it.” Who knows where Ferragni will go next? As a new mother, she’s experimented with mommy blogging. Maybe, as she ages out of “going out and going to concerts,” she could become an interiors influencer or even turn her love of traveling into a chain of her own hotels. “Now is a time when everybody can have a voice,” Ferragni says. “If you have something to say, you can have an audience that will listen to you. Some people are more about politics, some people are more about fashion, some people are more about being a mom—whatever you want. Whatever you’re interested in, you can find a community that shares your same interest.” The latest fashion news, beauty coverage, celebrity style, fashion week updates, culture reviews, and videos on Vogue.com.

 The designer Josephus Melchior Thimister, who died yesterday at the age of 57 following a long battle with depression, used his subtle talent to define the artful minimalism of ’90s fashion but struggled to find a place in the years that followed.
In ​Vogue​’s July 2000 issue, Thimister was heralded as one of 10 members of “The New Guard” alongside such peers as Nicolas Ghesquière, Hedi Slimane, Viktor & Rolf, and Junya Watanabe. “Thimister’s signature look,” wrote Sally Singer, “honed in his couture and ready-to-wear creations, is one of luxurious imperfection, of a grandeur distressed to a wicked grooviness.” Of Russian, Belgian, and French extraction, Thimister was born in Maastricht in the Netherlands and educated in England and Belgium, where he graduated as a star of the prestigious Antwerp Royal Academy of Fine Arts. Latterly he lived in Dublin. Dressed in his signature old-fashioned matelot top, Thimister met the late Karl Lagerfeld at a Chanel couture show. The designer told him he was too good to be an assistant, but he nonetheless worked briefly for Lagerfeld’s eponymous brand before landing the job of creative director at the house of Balenciaga in 1992. His debut collection, executed entirely in black and white, focused on the structural drama that was one of Cristóbal Balenciaga’s signatures and garnered new attention for the long-moribund house. Barneys and other prestigious fashion-forward retailers supported him from that first show. After 10 collections, (the last of which was set to a live rock music accompaniment so loud that Suzy Menkes and others walked out), Thimister struck out on his own (Ghesquière, formerly in charge of licenses, took over the helm). Thimister and his dedicated team worked for three months to produce a 49-piece haute couture collection that he presented during the January 1996 Paris Couture Week (having fulfilled the exigent demands of the Chambre Syndicale de la Couture) in the glacial École des Beaux-Arts. Thimister’s sister helped finance the collection; Armand Hadida, the owner of L’Eclaireur, loaned him his own workrooms; and the models—including, on one memorable occasion, Naomi Campbell—generally walked his runway for free. Thimister told​ Vogue’​s André Leon Talley, who would become a friend, that he was thinking of clients who “want couture clothes for real life today.” Thimister Spring 2012 Ready-To-Wear His proposition, which included elegantly draped sheaths of chalky crepe and filmy tulle T-shirts worn over buff leather pants, attracted clients including such discriminating couture mavens as Inès de la Fressange, Deeda Blair, Anne Bass, and Jayne Wrightsman, and ​Vogue​ hailed a “breakthrough collection [that] established the designer as the crown prince of haute couture.” But with minimal backing Thimister was unable to sustain the momentum. “You have to choose to be small and artisanal, or big; in between you always lose,” he later explained. “And if you are small, you have to work like a nutcase.” Donatella Girombelli hired him to design her Genny collection and Thimister focused on his own ready-to-wear, where he “radically reimagined the very meaning of ​luxury.​” Many of these collections were presented on Stockman dummies in his monastically elegant apartment on Paris’s Invalides—a ground floor, loft-like space in a bourgeois apartment building scented with church incense and with candles burning in the antique chandeliers. Thimister would have placed a cherished Russian icon alongside contemporary art, and Dusty Springfield’s ​“The Look of Love” ​might be playing on the soundtrack. There were commodious black velvet sofas and cushions—at that point the gregarious and droll Thimister liked to entertain—zebra skins were laid on the lacquered black floors, and a taxidermy baby elephant and polar bear provided a surprise greeting. Thimister returned to the haute couture in January 2010 with a powerful capsule collection, ​“1915: Bloodshed and Opulence,​” which featured repurposed military jackets and canvas tents mixed with conventionally luxurious fabrics, and dye effects that suggested the spattering of blood. Thimister did not shy from violent references: He based a 1999 collection on the notorious Baader Meinhof gang. Although prescient,   t​he return to clothing design proved short-lived, but Thimister became the creative director for Charles Jourdan and also turned his aesthetic skills to decorating; he had already designed interiors for friends and for installations during the Biennale des Antiquaires. In recent years he had been teaching his exceptional and hard-won skills to a​ new generation of fashion students at La Cambre in Brussels and at the Institut Français de la Mode​.

 As Bella and Gigi Hadid’s stylist, Mimi Cuttrell gets a lot of questions. Chief among them: “Where do you find the best jeans?” More often than not, she’s sourcing one-of-a-kind vintage denim for the Hadids (as well as her other clients, including Ariana Grande and Priyanka Chopra), not hitting up a department store. The only place she goes for new denim is Scott Morrison’s label 3x1, located right here in downtown New York. She was drawn to a certain pair of black, side-slit flares, and not only did Bella choose to wear them, but she wore them again and again. They’re now a best-seller for the label—and for Morrison, it sparked the idea to collaborate on more supermodel-worthy styles with Cuttrell. His Mercer Street store also happens to house 3x1’s little denim factory, so they started from scratch. Through a series of meetings, Cuttrell reviewed the label’s enormous stockpile of denim (there are literally hundreds, if not thousands, of rolls lining the walls), buttons, pockets, and every tiny detail, then brought in her favorite vintage jeans for inspiration. The resulting capsule, which launches today, essentially includes every jean a modern woman needs right now: There’s a sexy, skintight black flare inspired by Bella’s original jean, but with an extra-snug fit around the knees (an area Cuttrell tends to tailor). The faded blue and black “dad jeans” in the collection were quite literally named after Cuttrell’s dad, Kirk, and have a relaxed, not-too-oversized fit. (She noted that it’s particularly difficult to find black jeans that aren’t stretchy and have the right vintage-inspired, lived-in wash.) The Diana jean, meanwhile, a loose straight-leg in pale blue, gets its name from Cuttrell’s mother, “but it also nods to Princess Diana, since those references [to her style] have been coming up so much,” she says. They’re also extra-long, which is good news for tall women like Cuttrell or anyone who wants to style their jeans with stilettos or boots. “I’m wearing them right now with Uggs,” she adds with a laugh. “I think I’ll wear them straight onto my flight tonight like this. I like when they bunch up or fold over at the bottom.” It isn’t hard to imagine Bella wearing the Diana jean in a similar, early-’00s-inspired way. “I always have my clients in the back of my mind,” Cuttrell says. “I’m thinking about what they lean toward, what we pull that gets worn, how they wear them on their days off.” She’s also attuned to what they don’t want to wear, and knows precisely what’s missing in the market. The square-neck tanks are an upgrade from Cuttrell’s usual Hanes, for instance, with double-lined cotton and stitching up the sides “to give a little lift, so you don’t have to wear a bra,” she explains. Another item you won’t find anywhere else: The Willow jean, which features cutouts along the hips and three “strings” connecting the waistband. They’re a wildcard in a collection of easy, oversized jeans—and have the Hadids’ names all over them. “I had to have one piece that was a little out there!” Cuttrell says. “I’d wear them with a bodysuit underneath or a crewneck sweater. You don’t want to go overboard with a really sexy top.” It for sure won’t be long before her supermodel clients get a leg up on the daring off-duty look. Shop the collection now at 3x1.com.

 In the basement of Maryam Nassir Zadeh’s storefront last night, just a few minutes before her scheduled set time, Kim Gordon tucks her brown speckled MNZ shoes into her bag. “I actually wear these flats of hers every day, but performing is different. I need a little bit of a certain height,” Gordon, who cuts a surprisingly slight figure, says of this last-minute change-up. Gordon had wanted to drop by Zadeh’s showroom earlier in the day to pick up something to wear, but she was too busy rehearsing for a Raymond Pettibon script reading at the New Museum, so she had settled on an outfit that felt a bit more animated. “Sometimes onstage I’ll wear shorts because I get energy from my legs, so I thought if I wore these spandex disco jeans maybe it would be the same thing,” Gordon says of the skin-tight metallic blue American Apparel jeans she decided to wear to the event (“You can still get some American Apparel online,” she says). She paired them with a watercolor-inspired printed sheer top from Raquel Allegra—when she looked at the tag to identify the brand, she realized that she’d been wearing the shirt inside out all night. Gordon performed an improvised set at the store’s 11-year anniversary party, which culminated in the artist holding her guitar high above her head, almost getting entangled in the fronds of a palm tree by the door, before pressing the instrument against the floor-to-ceiling glass windows that look out on Norfolk Street. A crowd of New York City fashion mainstays including Mike Eckhaus, artist Chloe Wise, and Gordon’s daughter Coco Gordon Moore joined those in Gordon’s creative circle, like Gang Gang Dance’s Lizzi Bougatsos, as the artist performed in a makeshift stage in the corner of the room. Earlier in the evening, guests partook in the artful, almost intimidatingly arranged food creations by chef Laila Gohar—potatoes were pierced with wicks and fashioned into candles, while nuts encased in honey had to be cut with small scissors to be sampled, and braided challah stretched multiple feet long across display stands. Zadeh had always been a fan of Gordon’s music, but the real link between the two is Gordon’s daughter, Coco Gordon Moore. Moore has modeled in Zadeh’s runway shows for the past few years, and Gordon has sat front row to watch the proceedings. “I felt it would be so personal to have her play, and also a unique and epic moment for MNZ to celebrate in a new, unexpected way to mark the next chapter in our creative journey,” Zadeh says of the decision to cap off the event with Gordon’s performance. “I come into her store because of Coco and I’ve been to shows and we have some mutual friends,” Gordon adds. “She’s just lovely, and it’s nice to see that spirit in New York, when everything is so commercial,” Gordon says. “I like how her clothes are femme but can be sexy in an offbeat way, and are just unexpected. Things are unexpected and surprising but not necessarily avant-garde,” Gordon adds, which lends itself well to her overall approach to fashion. “Onstage, I always like to dress against type and wear things that aren’t rock and roll, like a dress. I like things that are unexpected.” Gordon says that she doesn’t relate to the wave of ’90s nostalgia that’s come back into fashion nowadays, but she does admit that her daughter has given a new lease on life to some of her old pieces. Moore used to wear Gordon’s old X-Girl jeans when she was in high school (“She made those nerdy jeans work—suddenly those ill-fitting, nerdy jeans were cool”), but Moore has also influenced her mom’s style in other ways, beyond introducing her to the world of MNZ. “She reminds me that it’s good to have fun with fashion and simple goes a long way,” Gordon says. “Little details go a long way too, whether it’s a pair of sunglasses or earrings—you don’t need very much.” As she gets older, these lessons carry more weight. “When you’re young, beautiful, and tall, everything looks good on you,” Gordon says in reference to Moore. “As one gets older, it becomes harder to feel your identity because you also don’t want to dress like a teenager, so it’s difficult.” It might feel like a tricky balance, but Gordon is taking it in her stride.

 The weather in Manhattan right now, as I write this, is capital-F frigid. It’s cold enough to make you risk it all and move to the West Coast; or, at the very least, cancel any post-work plans in favor of hibernating at home (hi, Netflix). And dressing for such an arctic freeze is equally as uninspiring. Suddenly, all of your tailored coats from fall seem too thin and unappealing; that hideous (but warm) parka, meanwhile, has never looked so good. But leave it to a stylish trendsetter such as actress Sienna Miller to show that wearing layers upon layers can still look cool—meaning there’s no excuse to walk around this season looking like the giant marshmallow man from Ghostbusters. Today in New York City, Miller bundled up in a winter-ready look that’s a major mood for the long, dreary months ahead. You may be frozen and miserable, but your fashion doesn’t have to be! She began with an unexpected coat: an oversized shearling hoodie that’s equal parts trendy and practical. She then paired it with hefty wool trousers that were baggy in fit (perhaps there’s some Uniqlo Heattech hidden under there), chunky combat boots, and a wool hat. Cleverly, the star also carried around a burgundy leather tote by Frame that was roomy enough to stuff in any other warm essentials, such as scarves and gloves. Because let’s be real: you’ll need gloves to use your phone without getting frostbite.

 When she isn’t disappearing into a character, Charlize Theron is standing out in the latest runway trends. The Oscar-winning actress has a knack for pulling off dramatic fashions, even when she’s far from the red carpet—and yesterday in New York, she took a statement look from Isabel Marant to the streets. In a boxy six-button blazer and cropped silver jeans from the designer’s Resort 2020 collection, Theron projected off-duty glamour with laid-back ease. On anyone else, denim and a jacket would be a non-event, but Theron knows how to take otherwise casual pieces and give them a little more oomph. The metallic texture of her jeans, combined with the blazer’s extreme proportions, and finally paired with her glossy patent Pierre Hardy flats elevated the entire look without sacrificing comfort. An oversized Saint Laurent sac du jour bag, meanwhile, tied everything together with its black leather and metal studs. Currently on the promo tour for her latest film, Bombshell, Theron and stylist Leslie Fremar have kept fans on their toes fashion-wise: switching from bejeweled Alexander McQueen to accept her lifetime achievement honors at The Hollywood Film Awards, to gilded Dior Haute Couture at her Africa Outreach Fundraiser. The glamour is thrilling, but Theron manages to bring the same level of excitement to quieter moments, too—turning each coffee run or meeting into an editorial-worthy style statement.

 Rihanna’s rise to superstardom is the stuff dreams are made of: the Barbados-born talent was discovered by Jay-Z’s label Def Jam at just 15 years old, moved to the U.S. a year later, and became an international star seemingly overnight. But it seems the singer-turned-business entrepreneur has never forgotten where she comes from, despite all the success she’s enjoyed—and today, she seemed to pay homage to her roots on Instagram, where she sported a cheeky tee that referenced her past in style. Reading “Art School Dropout,” the design—by the London-based “non-binary queer-luxury” label Art School—alluded to the fact that Rihanna bypassed getting a traditional college degree during her upbringing (though she did earn the Humanitarian of the Year award from Harvard in 2017—talk about an iconic full-circle moment). In her Instagram caption, Rihanna also spoke of the “overwhelming” year that she’s had, apologizing to her “friends/family/coworkers who I have yet to get back to in the past months. I’m working on that ish called Balance,” she wrote. And why acquire a degree when life keeps her busy enough as it is? She styled her statement T-shirt with a dramatic top hat and tons of gold jewelry, including chain necklaces and the biggest ring on planet Earth—something I’m sure her multiple booming businesses helped pay for.

Whether you’ve got your sights set on Gstaad, Sun Valley, St. Moritz, or Jackson Hole, a restorative glass of vin chaud in front of the fireplace pairs best with an elevated wardrobe. For a classic approach to mountainside polish, make like Jackie Kennedy with her two children on a ski holiday in Gstaad. Reach for Matek’s base layers and See by Chloé’s shearling booties. Then top it off with Cashmere in Love’s balaclava, an accessory trend that seems less outrageous on the slopes. Or perhaps you’ve envisioned yourself slaloming in a chic all-in-one à la Sylvie Vartan or Charlotte Rampling? Go with a ski suit from fashion’s favorite new brand, Cordova. Or choose something by Perfect Moment, a modern-day staple when it comes to skiwear. Of course, a fearless use of color is another way to stand out on the slopes. For that, why not nod to Princess Diana or ’80s-era Brooke Shields in a yellow Bogner ski suit or a sorbet-color bomber. Below, the most iconic outfits sported on the slopes, and how to get the look now.

 Celine Dion is back in full force. The French-Canadian singer just debuted a new music video for her single “Courage” today, is releasing a new album of the same name on Friday, and will also embark on a world tour next week. In the midst of all these exciting projects, however, Dion hasn’t forgotten to serve up a bold fashion moment—hitting the streets of New York City today, she made the case for the return of a fancy, formal coat. Leaving her practical puffer at home (it’s freezing in Manhattan at the moment), the stylish singer opted for a more unexpected outerwear choice instead: an opera coat. The dramatic, floor-length cloak was most popularly worn in the 1800s as an evening garment, often tied over a gown and trimmed with ornate beads or fur. Dion’s style was a modern-day interpretation by Marc Jacobs, designed in black silk with a punchy floral print, and finished with a large, oversized hood. Underneath, her yellow dress also played up her throwback piece’s vibrant color scheme. Given her cape was enough of a statement on its own, Dion styled it with simple, polished accessories, including a white-top handle bag by Stalvey, sleek black patent pumps by Gianvito Rossi, Chopard jewelry, and large cat-eye sunglasses. Consider it proof that the opera coat isn’t just for attending the opera—if you’re a style icon like Dion, you can clearly pull off wearing it whenever you want.

 Harry Styles has touched down in New York City for his upcoming appearance on Saturday Night Live, and his earth-shaking presence in the Big Apple has unleashed packs of enthusiastic fans awaiting his appearance. (In fact, Harry lovers are already bracing the frost and camping out for SNL tickets at NBC headquarters.) It isn’t hard to see why: Styles is hypnotic. He is the glossily-maned king of quirk; the pretty green-eyed prince of sexadelic funkiness. Those cheeks are just so healthy. (They always appear pinched!) That slightly overgrown scruff has the quintessential amount of bristle. (Does it even itch when he’s growing it out?) Those teeth are so straight. (I bet he never even needed braces.) And now, Styles—never one afraid to take sartorial risks—can also boast the rare ability to make a sweater vest look hot; even a Lanvin sweater vest covered in sheep. Last night, after leaving his SNL rehearsal, the singer stepped out in a nubby blue sweater vest covered in the print. The piece would have appeared a little dorky on someone else, but not on Harry: Gen Z’s favorite rockstar paired the piece with a striped shirt (sleeves rolled up past the elbow), wide-leg pinstripe pants, and patent leather shoes in bubblegum pink. In theory, nothing here should work, but it does. The clash of bold stripes and kitschy graphics is like a delicious optical illusion. The pants are hiked-up just enough to add a hint of tailoring and definition to the silhouette, while the shoes and their uplifting color make for a perfect contrast. We expect Harry to be on a style tear this week. This morning, he also announced a world tour in support of his forthcoming album, Fine Line, for which he’ll be hitting the road Jenny Lewis and King Princess. He posed for the promo image in an unbuttoned fuchsia button-up shirt with matching suspenders, ribcage-skimming wide-leg white flares, and heeled boots. (Styles accessorized the look with his Crest commercial-worthy smile.) But Styles has continued to flex his fashion chops on the street, too—just yesterday, he stepped out in a $3,500 Gucci coat. Our only question? What will he wear onstage for SNL. (Our bets are on Gucci.) Either way, right now it seems it’s Harry’s world and we’re just living in it—or at least waiting in line to see it.

 Woodstock for Gen Z. That, according to one attendee, is what Tyler, the Creator has created in the Camp Flog Gnaw Carnival, which was held for the eighth time this past weekend in Los Angeles. The event is the perfect place for kids weaned on a non-genre-specific mix of rock and hip-hop to listen to their favorite artists and dress to the hilt in every subgenre of streetwear style possible. In Tyler, the event has an ideal impresario, since his musical career encompasses a potent mix of street and outsider styles. He first burst onto the scene in 2010 with his punk-rap group Odd Future. Tyler has since gone through many Madonna-esque transformations, and his latest album, Igor, is full of narratives of love triangles and heartbreaks—and a more grown-up sonic texture of slow-grinding rap and soul. While Tyler has changed, the foundation of the Carnival has remained roughly the same since its inception in 2012. Thousands of kids walk up a long hill into the parking lot surrounding Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, where they are greeted with merch stations, selfie booths (including, this year, a giant Converse sneaker designed by Tyler that festivalgoers can pose in front of). There are free carnival rides, carnie food and games, and of course three stages filled with some of the biggest acts in pop music. This year featured the likes of Solange, FKA Twigs, Willow Smith, The Internet, Lil Uzi Vert, and DaBaby. As Tyler’s popularity has grown, his fans have remained young, stylish, and cool. And their style has grown too. Gone are the fully decked-out Odd Future head-to-toe outfits. Now the typical uniform is more creative festivalwear. Think Coachella goes punk. But Tyler-inspired looks are still present: blond wigs—styled after the bob Tyler wears to transform into the title character on the cover of Igor—are everywhere, as are the babushka scarves rocked by A$AP Rocky in the “Babushka Boi” video (and later by Tyler and Frank Ocean). There are even a few throwbacks like the Odd Future “cherry bomb” prints and vintage Tyler donut-print sneakers. Mitchell, 28  
For Mitchell’s third Flog Gnaw, he opted for loose-fitting pants and a blazer, while rocking a Tyler-inspired blond wig. “It’s careless, comfortable, and loud,” he says of the Flog Gnaw aesthetic. “We’re out here not caring what others think.” Sota, 22
Born in Nagano, Japan, Sota has lived in Amsterdam for the past five years, and hopes to open a ramen shop there one day. “I especially think about colors,” he says about his style. He can’t wait to see The Internet and Thundercat later in the day. Kyn Carter, 19
@kyndollwork
Flower Boy, Tyler’s 2017 album, is one of artist Kyn’s favorite albums of all time. “After I broke up with my girlfriend, Flower Boy resonated with me a lot,” she says. “It has a safe place in my heart.” Tony, 27 and Nick, 28
“That had not crossed my mind,” says Nick, when asked if his and his festival-mate Tony’s Carhartt coveralls were inspired by Lil Nas X. “This is just real. We’re from Austin, Texas, so this is just us,” Tony concurs. A group of teens pass by and one of them shouts, “Those guys are doing it right!” (If you’re wondering, Nick’s shirt says, “Don’t Listen to Red Hot Chili Peppers.”) Jazmin Dawkins, 20 and MyChal Ellis Green, 21
@jazdawkins and @goatmanellis
Jazmyn is a Flog Gnaw lifer, having been to each of the eight Carnivals. “It’s crazy seeing it evolve a little every year,” she says. MyChal—a talented amateur rapper himself—has been listening to Tyler since he was 13. He considers Tyler’s latest, Igor, “innovative” and one of his favorite albums of all time. “His music kinda freed me up a little bit,” he says. Paul O’Mara, 21  
@paul.omara  
“It’s my first time at a music festival,” says Paul, who was a bit anxious to get so dressed up, but thrifted his whole outfit (with his friend Maddy Wren acting as his stylist) and made the leap into the streetwear-meets-golf style that Tyler has made so popular with his Golf Wang label. A filmmaker and student, Paul is working on an essay about “how hip-hop and streetwear have appropriated golf culture.” Brandon, 21
“He’s a free spirit, why can’t I be a free spirit?” says Brandon about being inspired by Tyler early on. Brandon is rocking a KidSuper jumpsuit that he “bought for a lot of money when I was poor,” he says with a twinkle in his eye, and a shirt from his friend Christopher McHale’s streetwear label. “And these shoes are from when Tyler was still working with Vans. A little throwback.” Ethan Neimeyer, 21  
@chief_ethan  
Ethan came down from the Central Valley to see Tyler, who inspired him to start his own streetwear line, Profile—he’s rocking pants that he screen-printed himself. “At first, I just thought it was interesting,” he says of the Carnival. “But it was so in your face, and I came to love the clothes.” Theo, 24  
Theo likes comfortable clothes if he’s going to be out at the festival all day. He picked up these painter pants from the Sherwin-Williams store for $15. Nia K. Robinson and Christiane
@niakrobinson and @christianelovee  
Nia is a host of the popular YouTube reaction channel Teens React. She calls her look “handmade ’60s British Invasion.” Christiane is an actor and she photographs underground bands in L.A. “I was always weird and that felt cool after seeing Tyler be weird,” Christiane says. “He inspired me to bring out my inner punk.” Ricky, 20  
@chainlinktwink  
“I was trying to feel the vibes,” says Ricky about getting the festival look together. “It’s everything I bought at a sex shop.” Dij, 24  
@yungdij  
Dij sees the Flog Gnaw Carnival as a place where everyone can “be weird,” as she puts it. “There’s no judgment.” Blü, 24  
@honeybluclue  
“We wanted to have that Cosmo and Wanda vibe; that Blossom and Buttercup feel,” the singer-songwriter says of the look she and her friend Autumn, pictured below, were going for. Autumn, 25  
@autumnthemystic  
“We wanna be modern-day renaissance women,” says Autumn of herself and her friends, including Blü, pictured above. “We work hard at being creative.” Lexi, 20  
@woahitslexii_  
Lexi and her friends came down from Redlands, California. “I love Flog Gnaw because it’s something totally different every time,” she says. “I really felt it when Tyler said his whole life he felt like a stepchild [in his acceptance speech for the Wall Street Journal Music Innovator award earlier this month]. But he found a creative outlet, and that’s cool.” Drey, 19  
@okaydrey  
“My inspo is golf, and e-girls with the big eyelashes and blush all over,” says Drey, who came down from Redlands, California, for Flog Gnaw. “The fishing vest I found at a thrift store for $3,” she says with a glittery smile. Drey has loved Tyler since being introduced to him by her older siblings. “I grew up with him,” she says.

 I’m going to miss this fleeting moment in fashion where I could safely browse my favorite shopping sites without coming across a single pair of shorts. On MatchesFashion.com, where the Resort collections are just trickling in, women’s trousers outnumber shorts by about 85%. Nordstrom offers a selection of more than 3,000 women’s pants and leggings (they’re grouped together on the site, though the leggings-as-pants debate rages on), and that doesn’t even include jeans, of which Nordstrom has 3,200 pairs. It adds up to upwards of 6,000 full-length styles. As for shorts? There are just 538. That’s all about to change, of course. Shorts were one of the biggest trends of Spring 2020, and also the most straightforward. They were an uncomplicated, easy-to-digest counter to the season’s more abstract and politically-charged themes, like “hot ghoul summer” and pannier skirts. We could spend days—weeks!—thinking about Simone Rocha’s dark, witchy response to the bad news swirling around us, or the feminist undertones of Loewe’s unwieldy hoop skirts (they emphasized the hips, the center of female reproduction). As Vogue Runway editors, we’re conditioned to dig deeper into those concepts, to consider their cultural implications, to find the story. We enjoy it more than we fantasize about actually wearing the clothes. Which brings me to shorts: They don’t require much in the way of interpretation. They’re just…abbreviated pants? Until now, shorts weren’t even part of the fashion conversation; most of us regarded them as nothing more than a last-ditch effort to stay cool in the summer. The Spring 2020 runways, meanwhile, offered every variation on length, style, and fabric: up-to-there and sparkly shorts at Saint Laurent, baggy shorts at Etro, tailored culottes at Celine. There’s not really a unifying message behind shorts, making them a surprisingly “trendy” trend at a time when fashion is moving away from that model. Of course, if you went down the fashion history rabbit hole, you’d discover that women didn’t start wearing shorts until the 1930s, though they were still considered risqué. Even in the ’40s and ’50s, women were banned from wearing shorts in a few cities. Unsurprisingly, shorts became a subtle feminist symbol, but never had the impact of, say, a pantsuit. Shorts don’t stand out in our memory the way a suffragette’s all-white outfit does, probably because they didn’t remain a taboo; shorts were commonplace for men and women by the ’60s. That said, if you’re inspired to wear a ’30s-inspired short in homage to those early rule-breakers, be my guest! But I don’t think the designers who put shorts on their Spring runways—among them Michael Kors, Anthony Vaccarello at Saint Laurent, and Natacha Ramsay-Levi at Chloé—had that story in mind. It’s more likely that shorts simply looked fresh to their eye, and after seasons of miniskirts creeping back into fashion, it was only a matter of time before shorts emerged as a kicky alternative. Still, fashion on the whole is looking increasingly polished and cleaned-up, which makes the abundance of shorts—widely considered a garment you retire after childhood—all the more confusing. The question isn’t whether or not a grown-up can wear shorts, because of course she can; it’s does she want to? I’m going to guess the answer for many of us is no. It’s not just about showing a lot of leg; it’s the trendiness and the styling conundrums. What shoes do you wear with shorts? (Dries Van Noten says platform boots; Alexander Wang says pointy pumps; Kors says studded creepers.) Should you wear tights underneath? (Vaccarello says yes.) Are they appropriate for work? (Who’s to say?) This writer hasn’t enjoyed wearing shorts since the first grade, when I was sent home from my rigid Catholic school in tears for wearing them on October 1, the day the dress code officially switched to pants (never mind the lingering heat). I didn’t even like those navy pleated shorts, but perhaps they kicked off my lifelong anti-shorts stance. As I grew older, I never felt like I was missing anything by not having shorts in my wardrobe, save for a pair of cut-off Levi’s to wear on the beach. It’s worked out that my personal tastes have aligned with what’s happening in fashion: hemlines got longer, dresses got breezier, trousers got looser, and no one paid shorts any mind. It’s hard enough to find a great pair of pants, despite the literally thousands of options; we’re constantly getting them taken in, tapered, hemmed. Shorts seem like an even greater headache. My alternative is no less divisive, of course: bubble skirts. Yes, they’re a little trendy, but it’s my opinion that they’re actually easier to wear—and show just as much leg.

 The late Princess Diana had many virtues, including inimitable charm and an understated sense of royal style. But fashion fans will remember she had a real flair for athleisure, too. Who could forget those iconic photos of Princess Diana running around town in a baggy “Fly Atlantic” pullover sweater, peach bike shorts, and chunky runners? Hailey Bieber certainly remembers: the trendsetting model just put her own millennial twist on the look. Today, Bieber made her way to the gym in Los Angeles sporting Princess Diana’s signature off-duty pairing: a baggy sweater worn over tight leggings. But she updated the throwback style. Bieber’s Vetements sweater  read “Unavailable”—an ironic streetwear piece that could not be more Gen Y. She then slipped on some funky sneakers, which were very Yeezy-esque in shape. And she finished off the look with a Vous baseball cap and a discreet shoulder bag that was too small to be a gym bag, unlike Princess Diana’s large totes (yet another styling update—mini bags are all the rage). This isn’t the first time Bieber has paid tribute to Princess Diana. Back in August, the model appeared in an editorial for Vogue Paris wearing modern-day recreations of the royal’s best athleisure looks. But this latest remake proves she’s a true Diana diehard.

 The red carpet is currently experiencing a menswear revolution, but the buzz has primarily focused on Hollywood’s younger stars. Sure, millennials and Gen-Zers like Ezra Miller, Chadwick Boseman, and Timothée Chalamet can pull off inventive suiting, skirts, and just about anything else. Still, youth isn’t a prerequisite for risk-taking fashion. At last night’s Los Angeles premiere of Charlie’s Angels, Sir Patrick Stewart gave the kids a lesson in runway relevance, arriving at the Regency Theater in a stylized look from Kim Jones’s Fall 2019 Dior Men collection. The 79-year-old star of Star Trek: The Next Generation and the X-Men movies, Stewart has always been well-dressed, but he usually sticks to the classics. Perfectly tailored suits or understated blazers have comprised the bulk of his premiere and press tour wardrobe, but for the relaunch of the Angels franchise only a special suit would do. A remixed take on the traditional tux, the Dior design featured a sweeping sash and space-age technical cotton. Worn with flair—would you expect anything less from Captain Jean-Luc Picard?—as he posed next to co-stars Kristen Stewart, Naomi Scott, and Ella Balinska, the tuxedo made Stewart the evening’s best-dressed man and a shining example of ageless style. After all, why should twentysomethings have all the fun? The latest fashion news, beauty coverage, celebrity style, fashion week updates, culture reviews, and videos on Vogue.com.

 Since September, Katie Holmes has been serving up the best of fall fashion. The stylish actress has worn great—and affordable!—blazers and lust-worthy designer jeans, and she’s even put seasonal spins on more summery pieces, like a slinky slip dress. Yesterday, Holmes continued her fresh styling streak on the streets of New York City. This time, it was all about her sleek sneakers. Holmes chose white low-tops by Veja, a French brand that produces sneakers using organic materials and fair-trade practices. (They also have a large assortment of sustainable vegan leather styles, too.) The actress’s pair retails for $150; similar colorways are available here. As for the rest of her look, Holmes sported several pieces from Wardrobe.NYC, including a denim button-up shirt, straight-leg jeans, and a chic wool overcoat. A structured brown cross-body bag by Little Liffner, with a gold chain strap, lent further polish to the outfit. But it was the star's minimal kicks—packed with an ethical, eco-friendly message—that were the standout.

 Harry Styles knows how to make an entrance. He walks with the swagger of a thousand in-his-prime Mick Jaggers. His strut is powered by the glass-shattering, collective vocal chords of his millions of screaming fans. Yesterday, Styles made his larger-than-life presence known: He stepped out in New York City to see Jeremy O’Harris’s Slave Play on Broadway. The entertainer’s look had the quintessential sartorial components of a rockstar ensemble. He wore a simple white T-shirt with a nubby striped cardigan, dark wash denim flares, and white sneakers. But there was also a touch of sharp luxury thanks to his choice of outerwear. Forever a darling of Alessandro Michele’s Gucci, Styles sported a light brown wool coat by Gucci. The tailored piece was covered in the house’s interlocking G monogram. Want it? It will set you back a healthy $3,500. While the coat was certainly a stand-out, the accessories added a saucy shine. Styles topped off the sumptuous outerwear with that Brit favorite, the newsboy cap, an item especially beloved by the Beckhams! For the final touch, the rockstar — who is no stranger to man-jewelry— covered his knuckles in rings (including a hulking gold ring in the shape of a letter “H”) and wore a jade cross around his neck. It’s a bird. It’s a plane. It’s Harry Styles as the tender, well-dressed rockstar of today.

 This morning in London, Kate Middleton and Prince William attended a charity event to benefit Shout, an organization that supports people in crisis. For the occasion, the Duchess of Cambridge opted for an ensemble that was polished and professional, choosing a classic 9-to-5 pairing that was all about spotlighting her comfy work pumps—because even royals gravitate towards practical footwear that can be worn all day long. For her various appearances this year, Middleton has regularly worn chunky block heels, a sturdy silhouette that’s a more arch-friendly alternative to her beloved pin-thin stilettos. Her latest take, a pointy-toed suede style in black by Gianvito Rossi, features an 85-millimeter heel height (not too high, not too low). She accessorized her comfy shoes with yet another wardrobe staple: a plaid Smythe blazer styled over a classic white tee. Red trousers by Joseph, meanwhile, gave the look a pop of color. So, while Middleton may not be trading in her glittery princess shoes or sky-high Jimmy Choos anytime soon, she’s sensible enough to give her feet an occasional rest. Below, shop 6 similar styles.

 About halfway through New York–based photographer Simon Burstall’s newly released photography book, ’93: Punching the Light, his carefully arranged, cleanly presented black and white photographs, largely from his 16-year-old raving days in warehouses outside of Sydney in 1991, are abruptly disrupted by a burst of color. It’s only when these patchwork scrapbook pages appear—in which rave fliers, Burstall’s friends’ psychedelic drawings, and his own diary entries are piled on top of one another—that it really sinks in that Burstall was just a teenager when he snapped all of these nostalgic, deeply personal images, in the dog days of high school and just starting to play around behind the lens. The charming naivete of a young person becoming wrapped up in something all-encompassing is very clear, though, when you get to the page where he methodically lists and rates every rave he went to. Happy Valley II was “the best,” he says, whereas Relativity is described as “a waste of drugs.” Burstall now lives in upstate New York with his two young children, mostly working as a commercial photographer, but ’93: Punching the Light (which was published by Damiani Books) traces his artistic origins, which happened to coincide with the halcyon days of Sydney’s underground rave scene. These photos had been sitting in Burstall’s parents’ attic for decades, untouched, and it wasn’t until the summer of 2016, when his parents were clearing out that house to sell it, that Burstall started to scan them. “That’s when the light bulb went on, but I didn’t know how hard it was going to be, and what I would go through emotionally to figure it out,” Burstall describes. “Photography is about instinct—you see something and you’re like, that’s the moment that I want to shoot, but going back through old stuff and trying to re-edit it, and especially with the new element of introducing these diary entries and flyers, it was a real challenge.” The diary entries were particularly hard for him to go through, as it was a journal he started around 1991 when he had just enrolled at a boarding school. “I kept the diary because I was lonely—I was sick with mono and glandular fever, and I’m in a boarding school and that was fucking weird as hell, and then I’m going to these secret things every weekend, and I didn’t have anyone to talk to.” Burstall combed through his entries and tried to pull out moments that felt timeless. The last entry that Burstall includes, which is dated from December 4, 1993, will strike a chord with any experienced raver trying to pull themselves out of a mounting sense of monotony: “Tonight I’m going to try to get the feelings I used to get at a rave. I have noticed that the reason I’m not having a good time is because I go every week. Same people, same music, and usually the same drugs. All I do is talk all night. I know way too many people but tonight is going to be different.” Burstall can’t quite remember the circumstances that led him to his first rave (his memory is understandably a bit foggy), but he was the first of his friends to go. At that time, DJs played a wide variety of music—a majority of the partygoers and DJs were from the United Kingdom, and you’d hear everything from ethereal piano breakbeat house (Burstall’s favorite), to Balearic house with its provenance from Ibiza, or later on the more breakneck pace of happy hardcore. Burstall first experienced it all when he went to a party called Hardware in 1991 at the Sydney Exhibition Hall, a relatively larger venue that could accommodate a few thousand people. “I remember having acid for the first time and losing the friend I went with, and then the sun coming through the windows, and the bouncy castle—everything was just bonkers,” he says. “That’s when it all changed.” The warehouses weren’t up to code—Burstall remembers the entire structure would shake along with the beat—and there was one party where the DJ booth was set up on a scissor left, so the DJ could ascend and survey the party from up high at their will. He immediately felt drawn to capturing what he was experiencing on film. “For the most part, I knew a lot of these people and faces, so I felt no intimidation to get on top of whatever was around. I think I stood on an industrial refrigerator one time, to take a photo,” Burstall says. “ I was just like, ‘Oh my god, this is fucking awesome. I need to photograph this.’ No one gave a shit—you can see it in the photos, no one cares.” Burstall hadn’t developed much technique yet, but it didn’t really matter. “I didn’t know focus, depth of field, anything—just shoot, shoot, shoot it. My friends at the time were behind me. They knew this was something special.” Burstall’s photos intentionally don’t always reflect the hedonism that you might expect of the era. “The only time I pulled the camera out was in the morning. I made a real point of it—I didn’t want to flash, and I didn’t want to expose the situation,” he says of his early approach to documentary captures. “I wanted it to be just more of a fly on the wall.” Once the sun rose, he would go back to his mom’s Corolla and grab his 35-mm camera—a few times his art teacher lent him a medium-format camera—and snap photographs of his friends hanging out with each other in the parking lot outside the warehouse. “I didn’t want to make this book about what you might think a rave would be—lasers and finger-pointing and all the bullshit. I didn’t want that. Raves were about you going back to your carpark, your sanctuary, the mothership, the place you could always go to if you were having a meltdown, needed a pick-me-up, or needed a time out, and my mother’s Corolla was it.” Beyond the car parks, fashion played an important role in bringing people together. “You could be a student or a plumber, but once you noticed someone on the street based off what they were wearing, you gave them a nod. It was a big social leveler,” Burstall says. It’s hard to imagine being able to identify a raver with that much ease in today’s social landscape, where the sartorial signatures of certain subcultures start to bleed into each other—a person wearing baggy jeans and chunky sneakers nowadays could just as likely be a skater, for example. In Burstall’s era, though, baggy jeans, Caterpillar boots, fanny packs, big belt ties, and short-sleeved striped T-shirts made up a sort of uniform. “The jeans would just drag along the ground and get all frayed and wet,” Burstall says. “We’d spend a lot of time at thrift stores. You’d find your odd, weird T-shirt with great graphics, or you’d find your big stripey T-shirt. I was getting into big denim flares—the bigger the flare to cover your boots—and that was the silhouette: super skinny and bang, and that would drag, and maybe you’d have a silly, stinky polyester bowling shirt, like ’70s style, or a grandpa cardigan with little pockets on the side.” Flip through Burstall’s book, and you’ll come across plenty of the styles he lists; interestingly, Caterpillar boots, striped baggy tees, and bucket hats are silhouettes and styles now returning to the zeitgeist. But just as quickly, the scene that Burstall became so enamored with began to change. By 1994, it was falling apart. “It just became about the money, and people started to put on dodgy parties.” A few years later, Burstall left Australia to pursue photography in the U.S., landing in New York City when he was just 24 years old. “It was all a path leading me here.” Looking back through his photographs, though, and Burstall still can’t quite articulate why raving became his whole world back then. “I guess because as everyone says there’s an element of freedom to it, or an element of secrecy. There wasn’t any element of sleaziness to it,” he says. “It was just very special, and we weren’t trying to find anything but a community of people.” The latest fashion news, beauty coverage, celebrity style, fashion week updates, culture reviews, and videos on Vogue.com.

 “I think this is a really commercial piece,” says Beckett Fogg, one half of the team behind Area, holding up a stiff metal cage wrought of rainbow-hued crystal. To which I respond, with astonishment, “Commercial?” But Fogg insists. “It’s really commercial because of the many ways you can wear it! Look—you can just put it over a white button-down shirt. You just have to have that emotional connection. Our embellishments, our crystals, our trims really draw you into the fantasy.” Though Area’s gender-nonspecific extravaganzas may be a truly postmodern fantasy, Piotrek Panszczyk, Fogg’s codesigner of the New York–based line, says the creations have deep roots. “We love classic things, but we want to recontextualize them,” he explains. “Glamour can be rhinestones, but it can also be an Hermès double-face cashmere coat. We look at old references—’60s Balenciaga, Lanvin couture—and try to strip things down, make it in a new way.” A visit to the Area atelier on Manhattan’s Canal Street, where the spring 2020 collection is on resplendent display, offers compelling evidence of just how far you can twist and stretch the notion of classic. Here are examples of the kind of high-gloss elegance that hasn’t been seen lately—an unabashed tribute to the notion that you can be a literal shining star. The eye lingers on crystal streamers welded into 3-D panels; an extraordinary black gown, made of what could be gigantic spaghetti tubes, pretty much defies description. (Okay, here’s a try—is it the gorgeous offspring of an octopus and a Venus flytrap?) But there are also catsuits in blown-out herringbone checks and peach satin frocks with balloon sleeves that happily acknowledge their couture heritage. If you are still tempted to dismiss the collection as fundamentally rock-and-roll—and yes, Rihanna, Beyoncé, and Ariana Grande are all fans—no less a grown-up than Michelle Obama has sported Area’s strict black suit (albeit dripping in crystal fringe) on her book tour. “We added long sleeves for her,” Fogg confides. And suddenly you think, Maybe this is what commercial means now? Could the secret to seducing the customer lie in the breaking down of boundaries, of throwing out assumptions and offering something that is meant to impress with craftsmanship—to
sparkle and spark joy? There’s a spirit of liberation infusing these clothes: Despite their sheer—in both senses of the word—audacity, nothing is intended to elicit a stereotypical male gaze. Women will don these body-positive celebrations strictly for themselves. (Men can, of course, wear a stringy-fringy gown if they’re feeling it—lines are meant to be crossed!) Case in point: A keynote accessory this season is a metal mesh “beard” that clips on—a sexy sleeper hit that provokes and delights. Fogg, 31, and Panszczyk, 33, met in a graduate program at Parsons, drawn to each other by a shared desire to manipulate and transform fabric. Fogg recalls that at the time, “I was taking leather to a place in New Jersey and embossing it, making it 3-D.” Fogg hails from Kentucky and has a degree in architecture; Panszczyk—born in Poland, raised in Holland, and having worked for Chloé in Paris—came here on a scholarship eight years ago. (They both now live in Brooklyn, Panszczyk with his husband in Clinton Hill, Fogg in Brooklyn Heights, where she and her husband will welcome their first child this month.) “I walked up to her and said, ‘This is cool—tell me what you’re doing,’ ” Panszczyk remembers. “We became friends, and we started talking about doing something together, and I said, ‘You’re crazy.’ ” But sometimes the craziest ideas are the best ideas. In 2013 the pair sold a gazillion gleaming T-shirts at Opening Ceremony; in 2015 they made their first formal presentation, and the marriage of exquisite metallurgy with the nerviness of the silhouettes has turned out to be a big hit; in 2016 they were CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund finalists. And no one was more shocked than the designers themselves when they learned that they ranked third at Coachella—right after Revolve and Fashion Nova—in earned media value, a financial calculation that measures social-media engagement. “Neither of us are exactly from fashion capitals,” Fogg says, laughing. “I mean, I’m from Lexington, Kentucky, and he’s from Poland!” Could this be why they have such a deep understanding of the transformative power of clothes, the desire to become another person—more confident! bolder! louder!—just by slipping into something fabulous? As Fogg puts it, “It’s definitely occasion dressing—but the occasion could be you in your room posting on social media.” The latest fashion news, beauty coverage, celebrity style, fashion week updates, culture reviews, and videos on Vogue.com.

 “Have you said everything you wanted to say in fashion?” “No.” That is the promise dangling at the end of Reiner Holzemer’s new documentary, Martin Margiela: In His Own Words, which premiered at the Doc NYC film festival last week. After 90-ish minutes of exposition from Margiela himself, who remains so elusive only his hands were filmed, Holzemer abruptly asks if fashion’s most celebrated genius is really, truly, undeniably done with it all. No. And then the screen cuts to black. Any hopes of Margiela’s return to fashion will have to be sidelined for now, however. “He won’t work as a fashion designer anymore in his life—probably,” Holzemer told Vogue during an interview on the day of the film’s world premiere. “But you never know. We all love that the movie ends with this. It gives you a nice smile in the end, which is important.” Holzemer’s film is not so much about where Martin Margiela is in 2019—the designer speaks of painting and sculpting, though those pursuits are not shown in the documentary—or what he might do in 2020, but about the 20 years from 1989 to 2009 during which Margiela operated his eponymous label. As a portrait of a finite body of work—the two decades of Martin Margiela runway shows—Holzemer’s film operates as a circle: It begins with Margiela’s Spring 2009 20th-anniversary show, his final one, then waltzes through a chronology of his life and career with the help of talking head interviews with Olivier Saillard, Carla Sozzani, Stella Ishii, Pierre Rougier, Cathy Horyn, and more of his models, collaborators, friends, and critics, before finishing back at Margiela’s swan song. That format allows for deep dives into the designer’s key collections and career points. It helps that the documentary was made alongside the preparation and installation of the Palais Galliera’s 2018 exhibit, Margiela / Galliera, 1989-2009. For 42 days, Holzemer, sometimes alone, sometimes with a skeleton crew, would visit the museum or Margiela’s studio and get the designer talking. “Which garments are important, which do you think we have to include in the movie?” Holzemer says he asked Margiela as they began filming. There were 110 items in the exhibit, and he made a list of 90 for the film. Ultimately, they settled on around 70 crucial pieces, which are presented with voiceovers by the designer. These range from his cork necklaces—which we see Margiela making with his own hands as the film starts—through his doll collection of 1994 and his stockman collection of 1997. “I’m very grateful that he opened up and he trusted me so much. It was not always easy for him,” Holzemer says. The hits are all here: The Spring 1990 show staged in a playground (“The most magical show of my career”), his time as creative director of Hermès (“For me, luxury is the perfect balance between quality and comfort and if I could go farther I would add timelessness”), the Spring 2007 show that worked to establish new Margiela codes (“I wanted to be different, new, without rejecting my fans…. It felt like a new beginning.”) As the movie seeks to illustrate, Margiela did almost everything that is on trend in contemporary fashion first: He had street cast shows, he popularized the long, lean lines of the ’90s, he made a reissue collection for his 10th show, he pushed and pushed and pushed the creative bounds of what a fashion show was and what a fashion brand could look be. “I hope that, first of all, his name and the work stays alive, that people discover how influential he was, how much of what we see today on the catwalks is sometimes copied one-to-one—I don’t need to mention the names, I’m not an expert of that,” Holzemer says. “I think if the world knows where the Margiela influence comes from, that would make me very happy.” Of course, what Margiela also did first was what he did last: Leave fashion for good. “I was not made to cope with that system as well as Jean Paul Gaultier,” says Margiela, who was Gaultier’s assistant before launching his own label. “Jean Paul always said, ‘Martin you’re too serious,’ and it’s true […] I am probably too serious for that world.” Margiela’s departure is a story that has become familiar within fashion’s creative industries: the struggle to translate a personal passion into a corporate consumer product. It’s here that the film touches a nerve, but instead of prodding it, it lets the audience read between the lines. The sale of Maison Martin Margiela to Renzo Rosso’s Only the Brave group, the departure of Margiela’s partner Jenny Meirens, and Margiela’s own absence are covered without too much emotionality, although fashion insiders will be able to interpret Margiela’s careful language about the reason for his departure: “At the end, I became, in a certain way, an artistic director in my company and that bothered me because I am a designer […] I am not a creative director who directs his assistants.” The irony of Holzemer’s delicate portrait of an artist in absence is that it was Margiela’s replacement who inspired the director to take an interest in fashion as a subject. (Holzemer worked on films about photographers before taking up fashion with the documentary Dries about Dries Van Noten in 2017.) “Why I wanted to make a fashion movie was the Galliano story,” Holzemer says, referencing the public meltdown that got John Galliano fired from his position at Christian Dior. After entering rehab, Galliano was named the artistic director of Maison Margiela in 2015. “I read a big article about the pressure fashion designers are under. I was really touched by that article. It was a bad thing that Galliano did, but in that article it explained that some of the designers take drugs to survive. Alexander McQueen killed himself. That was the thing that caused my sensitivity for the profession, for the world, for the industry. […] How do I say it? I work hard too, but the fashion designers work so hard under such pressure wherever that pressure comes from, sometimes it’s big companies, sometimes it’s yourself. That it’s really a challenge to remain in that business for so long and to survive in that business in a healthy way.” Holzemer indicates that he knows there is a lot of pain here for Martin Margiela—but he won’t say anything about it, nor does much of that tension make it to the screen. “You don’t see that in the movie. Often I was looking at his face, the camera was on the wall, it was only listening, and I thought, It would be so strong if I could show your face now. I still have it in my memory. It was often very touching. The story was always surprising because you could not read it. He told it for the first time: How he felt after the first show, how he felt after 10 years, and how he felt in the end. Nobody knew that before.” Even with these small, tender moments of Margiela’s vulnerability that reveal the glimmer of a sensitive, caring, gentle man, this documentary doesn't go beyond affirming many of the myths already made about Martin Margiela. Yes, there are incredible glimpses into his childhood in Genk, Belgium, and his sketchbooks—with every year of the designer’s life saved by his mother, Léa Bouchet—but the final film still works behind layers of abstraction. It is mostly about the exhibit, it is without its star’s visage, and even the voice over of Margiela’s lyrical Franco-Belgian intonation is slightly engineered to cloak the reality of what Martin Margiela actually sounds like. In Dries, one of the most compelling moments is one that seems almost incidental: Van Noten and his partner, Patrick Vangheluwe, silently snipping flowers from their garden and arranging them throughout their house, not a word spoken, not a nod exchanged. “You can talk a lot about perfectionism or obsession but there you see it, you feel it, and it says it all,” Holzemer says of that scene. Martin Margiela: In His Own Words never gets to that show-don’t-tell moment because so much of the story has to be told in voiceover or in interview segments. To adequately show the brilliance of Martin in the year 2019—30 years after his seismic start and a decade after that anniversary show that proved to be his last—something really unexpected would have to happen in the film. For the most part, it doesn’t. But maybe it’s best that the curtain stays drawn a little longer. By protecting Margiela from the cold gaze of a camera, Holzemer allows us superfans to keep our fashion-world hero alive, no flaws, no tensions, no negativity; only these memories and the knowledge that the heart behind the Margiela universe is still beating. Toward the end of the film, Holzemer shows the opening of the Galliera exhibit, long lines shivering in Paris’s March cold. Inside, Vogue editors gasp at the installation, Raf Simons gestures at a mannequin, Rick Owens contemplates in admiration. The legend of Martin Margiela lives on. And then there’s always the promise of his return…. The latest fashion news, beauty coverage, celebrity style, fashion week updates, culture reviews, and videos on Vogue.com.

 You might recall wearing Patagonia pullovers or the North Face fleece jackets as a child, and think of the bright-colored and patterned half-zips as the ultimate après-ski garb. But this season, the ’90s-era pullover fleece has made a return—with new iterations from both classic heritage brands that have been offering the cold-weather staple for decades, to more avant-garde styles plucked straight from the Fall 2019 runways. Like many other basic staples such as Tevas or puffer jackets, the fleece jacket has been given a whole new spin after making its runway debut and receiving a high-fashion stamp of approval. While cold-weather brands like Columbia have never stopped making the style, new iterations from the likes of 3.1 Phillip Lim, Sandy Liang, and John Elliott have offered plenty of reasons to dust off those old fleece sherpas. Street-style stars dabbled in fleece jackets during a frigid February New York Fashion Week earlier this year, and the colorful fuzzy zip-ups are guaranteed to be a key layering piece once again this winter. Chic updates on the style are available at a more accessible price point too: Ganni has come out with its own retro fleece vest, teaming up with Nordic outerwear company 66 North, a collaboration which combines the latter’s technical fabrics with the former’s trademark Scandi-chic style. Meanwhile, JW Anderson has designed a new fleece jacket for Uniqlo, which is celebrating its 25th anniversary of creating fleece products. Don’t have an old fleece to dig up? Try scoring one at a thrift shop, or snagging one of the North Face or Everlane’s 100% recycled polyester versions. Otherwise, keep warm all winter long in one of our top 15 fleece picks below.

 Walt Cassidy out multi-hyphenates just about everyone. The New York–based Cassidy is a jeweler, artist, and former Club Kid who went by the moniker Waltpaper back in the ’90s. Cassidy is able to add further hyphens to the list now that he is an author—his book, New York: Club Kids, is published at the end of this month—and a designer, with the collaboration, Opening Ceremony x New York: Club Kids by Waltpaper, launching November 15. (Incidentally, he also has a collaboration with MAC debuting around the same time, likewise tied to his book.) Cassidy’s capsule for OC riffs on his past in all its glorious DIY, make-your-dreams-come-true authenticity, but with the vantage point of how the era might resonate today. New York: Club Kids is a brilliant I-was-there chronicle of the glorious, gaudy, and gorgeous creatures who stalked the New York nights of the ’90s, an oddly touching and affecting remembrance of both youthful knowingness and innocence. His OC collection, meanwhile, pushes that time period into today by using new graphic motifs by artists who once designed club logos—most iconically on a lunchbox, which many Club Kids toted as if it were the downtown Birkin—or by isolating the iconic portrait of a twizzle-haired teenaged Cassidy on a hooded sweatshirt. Opening Ceremony’s Humberto Leon jumped at the chance to collaborate with Walt Cassidy because, he says, “[The] era was beautiful, exciting, adventurous, [and had] some of the most renegade parties. It was one of the most modern ways of life and thinking, [one] that I believe we have yet to wholly catch on to. The individuality and freedom of expression [of the time] still feel fresh and new. The looks that happened and [were] documented in Walt’s incredible book will go down in history.”  That past is something that Cassidy experienced at its most vivid, but as the following conversation with him reveals, he’s able to look back without ever getting trapped there. Walt, tell me about how the collection for OC came together. Humberto Leon from Opening Ceremony came to know about my book through our mutual friend Chloë Sevigny, and approached me about hosting a launch event at the store. After sharing the book with him, we decided that it would be fun to design a couple garments inspired by my tales of the Club Kids. Then, after starting work on the OC capsule, I joined forces with Christian Mitchell and MAC Pro to curate a special seven-piece makeup set of Club Kid essentials, which will also be available at the launch. How did you decide what the collection should include?\ For the book, the capsule collection, and the MAC kit, I worked extensively with artists Dolphina Jones and Gregory Homs, both of whom are largely responsible for creating the imagery of the mega clubs that thrived in New York City from the late ’80s throughout the ’90s. We also incorporated photographic content by Tina Paul and Michael Fazakerley. For New York: Club Kids by Waltpaper, I was committed to bringing the elemental content of the ’90s, the details, images, and history, full circle into a present-day context. My agenda with this mini-capsule collection, like the book, was to activate new inspiration, and not just replicate and archive the past. A good example of this is the new Opening Ceremony logo that we created, hand drawn by Dolphina Jones and inspired by her original logo design for Disco 2000, the flagship Club Kid party at Limelight. Additionally, we established a signature Club Kid pattern, reminiscent of a field of bursting flashbulbs. An early version of this print was used on the first edition of Club Kid trading cards, produced in 1990. We used this graphic for a long-sleeve shirt, a lunchbox, and the package design for the Waltpaper x MAC Pro face kit. Did any of that speak to your styles and looks back in the day?\ We utilized the well-known portrait of me, as Waltpaper with the antennae hair, by the photographer Michael Fazakerley. There is an oversized print of that on a hoodie. A big part of the journey in making the book and the capsule collection, for me, was detaching [myself] from my own youthful identity and allowing the visual documents of my personal experience to represent a broader idea of club culture and the experience of being a young creative in New York City. That image of my 19-year-old self, to my delight, has come to represent notions of independence, rebellion, identity expression, diversity, and gender fluidity. When I look at that portrait, I see a liberated non-binary individual who is not bothered with fitting into any of society’s boxes, a refreshing and nourishing concept, especially amidst today’s culture of hyperactive profiling. What were some of your own favorite looks of yours back in the day? What inspired them? How did you source them, make them?\ Club Kid looks were generally handmade with materials scavenged from around the city. It was all about assemblage. We would gather bits and bobs at the industrial and plastic supply stores that dominated Canal Street. Utilizing hot glue, wire, and different art supplies, we’d combine them with dissected portions of athletic uniforms, vintage garments, and feathers and jewels found at trim suppliers. Patricia Field and Liquid Sky were important style hubs and resource centers. Outfits were often assembled to be worn for one night only, if they even lasted that long. It was not unusual to be hobbling home at 11 in the morning, with your outfit hanging off in pieces, after an epic journey into the night. There were two main Club Kid houses in Gramercy Park, where we lived together communally in the early part of the ’90s. As the decade progressed, a number of us landed at the Chelsea Hotel and Hotel 17. Being that we were all living together in these encampments, we shared a lot of our clothes and materials with each other. It was not unusual to see the same garment passed around and re-worked by various Club Kid personalities. The familial experience and the bonding that we shared as a group, is what I find to be the most charming part of the Club Kid narrative. We spent endless days scouring the streets of New York City together, searching for inspiration for looks. We engaged and challenged each other to push further and further into our own individual creative experiences. Makeup was an extremely important part of being a Club Kid. The original MAC store on Christopher Street played a huge role in assisting and encouraging the development of my identity as Waltpaper. MAC was so far ahead of the curve with makeup technology and branding in the ’90s. Their driving appeal was that they offered brilliant stage-like colors, but in very wearable form. I met my makeup mentor, Lia Rivette, at the original MAC store. She helped me set up a MAC Pro membership, which was incredibly helpful and supportive of my journey into makeup. I would stop in the shop every week to acquire new colors and products to experiment with and add to my ever-expanding makeup kit. What has been the most interesting and powerful revelation about revisiting that part of your life, for both the book and the OC collection? When I arrived in New York City, I made a commitment to myself to live my life as if it was a great book or movie. I was well aware of the fact that there were profound risks involved with this decision. Underground culture throughout history has been notoriously littered with landmines. Upon finishing the book, I was incredibly fulfilled, knowing that I was successful in not just achieving my original mission of living an interesting life, but also in surviving the experience. I am grateful that I was able to participate in a time period that would yield so much inspiration and creativity. I was able to align with my spiritual family and find my own tribe after many years of walking through childhood feeling alone, bullied, and isolated. I am forever in debt to New York City for offering me such an inspiring backdrop in front of which I staged my life. I hope that the book is of service to my own generation as well as future generations that will inevitably find their way to our city, with their own unique dreams, in tow. Much, if not all, what you and your fellow Club Kids wore back in the day underscored the term “mother of invention”: it was self-expression driven by whatever you could find to hand. Do you feel we’re looking for that again, that there’s a generation wanting to express its true and authentic selves, and not receive wisdom on labels and brands and street uniforms? I sense a strong connection between Generation X and the incoming Generation Z, in that we desperately crave authenticity, and both generations were germinated amidst conservative political eras. Generation X had to endure the dominance of Reagan and Thatcher, as well as the devastating AIDS pandemic. Generation Z is faced with countering Trump and other conservative international politicians, all [the] while facing the terrifying climate crisis that lies ahead of us. For the book, the overarching metaphor that I used to describe the ’90s is the concept of deconstruction. In ripping things apart, putting them back together, and then letting all the scars show, we were attempting to tell the truth about our inner experience in the exterior world. This could be seen in the music, as well as the DIY fashion and lifestyle choices of the decade. There was an immediacy that was undeniable in the ’90s, which was evident in the development of techno, grunge, heroin chic, piercing and body modification, and the popular use of street models in commercial ad campaigns. Also, it seemed to me to be a time where so many of the things we’re in the midst of doing—challenging beauty norms and conventions, empowering the individual, rejecting gender norms—were all part of the Club Kid culture. Do you see parallels between then and now? Absolutely. The seeds of today’s popular topics, like self and identity branding, influencing, the gender revolution, convention culture, and reality television were all germinated in the ’90s and amidst the Club Kid movement. In New York: Club Kids, I unpack some of the relationships between things like Outlaw Parties and flash mobs, and the Club Kid Style Summits versus today’s convention culture. I draw connections between our frequent appearances on daytime talk shows and today’s popular social media outlets, like Instagram, as well as reality television. The concept of presenting our identities solely as brands that were primed and ready for the mainstream was a very new idea. Television audiences were baffled and charmed at the notion that we were thriving in life, just by dressing up, hanging out in nightclubs, and being ourselves. To us, being fabulous was a medium unto itself. While many of us harbored a wide range of creative talents and aspirations, our identities, as Club Kids, were usually put forward as the most important component of our existence. Why do you think we still love the Club Kid era? A unique combination of audacity and playfulness was integral to our experience in the ’90s and is key to the lasting appeal of the Club Kids. We led transgressive lifestyles, but always maintained our sense of humor. The Club Kids embraced blurry lines and fluidity in a way that was decades ahead of their time. We were committed to pursuing anything fun, authentic, and creative. It proved to be a charming and engaging formula.

 Fashion in Lagos is booming, but don’t just take our word for it. Irene Agbontaen, the founder of TTYA London—a brand specifically catering to tall women—has seen the changes firsthand. Currently based between Lagos and the UK, Agbontaen has familial roots in Nigeria and a close connection to the nation’s artistic community. Over the years, she’s watched the growth of an “unapologetic DIY creative culture” that has enlivened Lagos Fashion Week and brought international attention to the city’s entrepreneurs and designers. “The energy and vibe of the people is what makes Lagos so special,” says Agbontaen. “We are in an important time where the creative industry in Nigeria is getting the spotlight it deserves. It’s my home, and every time I go, I connect with more and more people who are taking their careers into their own hands—it’s so inspiring to see!” In keeping with that collaborative spirit, Agbontaen joined forces with British-Nigerian designer, Tokyo James for a joint show in the middle of Lagos Fashion Week. First introduced on a shoot two years ago, the pair became fast friends thanks to their shared interest in designing pieces that could resonate with those previously excluded from the fashion conversation. “We both wanted to use our platforms to continue inclusivity for all within the industry,” says Agbontaen, who sought to create wardrobe essentials with a vibrant twist. To bring that idea to fruition, they sourced all materials locally and kept their manufacturing process within the community. Though the choice resulted in a few difficulties—the team spent two days in the town of Mushin, on the mainland during the rainy season while awaiting fabrics—the experience was unforgettable. “The great thing about a collaboration is having someone else to lean on,” says Agbontaen. “Being a solo designer can sometimes be lonely as everything rests on you, so I enjoyed bouncing ideas and overcoming challenges together.” Of course, there’s more to enjoy in Lagos than the collections. With each trip, Agbontaen takes time out to experience the city’s culinary and beauty hotspots, indulging in protein treatments at KLS Naturals and getting her amala and seafood okra soup at Yakoyo. Here, she takes Vogue along for her trip—from backstage at her big show, to dining with the city’s political elite. My Lagos Fashion Week experience began with ‘The Gathering’, a Fashion Business Series Dinner hosted by Heineken Lagos Fashion Week. The dinner was filled with creatives and international guests such as sustainability activist Bandana Tewari. [Here I am] with Adebayo One of Orange Culture and Denola Grey. Day two took me to Surelere, to the women I work with at the dyeing pits. Lola and Dami are the only two women that work at the dyeing pit, and this is the second year I’ve worked with them on fashion products. They use the traditional Adire tie-dye technique on modern-day silhouettes. We worked on the Black History Month Nike jersey and exploring fashion through heritage. For Lagos Fashion Week, TTYA teamed up with Nigerian designer Tokyo James on a capsule collection. Inspired by our cultural merge of a Nigerian heritage with a Western upbringing, the collection sourced all materials locally and included everything from vegan leather trenches to power tailoring and organza. New music sensation Rema, DJ Spinall, and Team GB Olympic champion Perri Shakes-Drayton walked the show. Before our show, Orange Culture also showed an amazing collection, titled ‘Goodbye To Me.’ On my final day, Tokyo James and I hosted a dinner with the British Deputy High Commissioner to Nigeria, Harriet Thompson, at the British High Commission Residence in Ikoyi. We invited some of our creative peers to a conversation on how we can open the channel for Nigerian creatives, both in Nigeria and the UK diaspora. Among the guests were cultural consultant Grace Ladoja MBE, photographer and creative director Stephen Tayo and Teni Zaccheaus  co-founder of Native magazine.

 swae-lee-instagram-tie-dye-grateful-dead-t-shirt It’s clear from only a few quick scrolls through Swae Lee’s Instagram feed that he’s unafraid of bold patterns. Just take the trippy, skull-printed overalls that Lee wore onstage at Madison Square Garden last month—the 40s & Shortiesswae lee-designed garment spells out “World Take Over” in red lettering over a busy, bright green pattern. Lee took his love of eye-catching patterns to an extreme, though, with the double tie-dye outfit he wore while in Denver, Colorado yesterday. The rapper paired a swirling Grateful Dead T-shirt, printed all over with the group’s signature dancing bears, with a similarly patterned pair of dip-dyed jeans. For Lee, tie-dye is more than just a passing fad. “I love tie-dye and its mixtures of colors,” Lee explained over email. “It all just clashes with no boundaries or rules, and that’s how I look at fashion.” Maybe Lee just sparked a whole new school of tie-dye thought, or maybe he’s a secret Deadhead. Either way, he’s clearly a master of the whirling print. The latest fashion news, beauty coverage, celebrity style, fashion week updates, culture reviews, and videos on Vogue.com.

 If you’re not following Marc Jacobs’s glorious Instagram page, you’re missing out: it’s a real fashion trip. He posts almost-daily outfit pics, which often include his favorite death-defying heels; he’ll invite plenty of double-taps with adorable photos of he and husband Char Defrancesco's three dogs; and on lucky days, he’ll even post some throwback snaps offering a glimpse of his style from years past. Today, Jacobs did just the latter when he revisited a style moment from almost four decades ago—and it has a sentimental story attached to it, too. His latest trip down memory lane, a photo taken back in 1980, shows the designer when he was just 17 years old, standing beside his late grandma in matching outfits. At the time, Jacobs was working for Charivari, a now-defunct boutique in New York City, as a stock boy (and later on, as a salesperson). He explained that the gig led to him securing matching looks for him and his grandmother: “I had convinced my grandmother to buy herself this Claude Montana knit dress,” Jacobs wrote of the store, adding that he “saved all my money from work to buy the men’s sweater version of her dress.” The his-and-hers Claude Montana pieces in question were white knits with hefty black stripes overtop. While they were certainly two peas in a (very chic) pod, Jacobs and his grandma did have two distinctive styling approaches to the pieces. Jacobs wore his sweater with “a pair of white cotton pants by designer France Andrevie and Velcro fastening Adidas,” he wrote, while grandma wore her dress “with low heeled pumps from Bottega Veneta.” (She had good taste, clearly.) They both, however, accessorized with jewelry from Robert Lee Morris’s store Artwear (also now shuttered). The only thing more impressive than the duo’s adorably coordinated looks? That would be Jacobs’s memory itself—I can barely remember what I wore last Tuesday.

 Over the past several weeks, headlines have warned of the imminent collapse of one of New York’s most storied retail institutions, Barneys: that the shopping mecca was facing bankruptcy, was up for sale, and would soon close—at least, as we know it. It has since been purchased by Authentic Brands for $271.4 million. The sales have started. The department store will supposedly live on as pop-ups in other department stores. I think of its future like a worn-out Russian matryoshka doll, still clinging to a romantic vision of old-school luxury. Amid the onslaught of information about court rulings and the store’s impending doomsday, my Instagram feed was filled with nostalgic posts from the account @SaveBarneys. The images were stellar: one advertisement, presumably from the mid-’90s, showed a model crouched in a fetal position with a killer black pump. (Prada, I imagine.) “Believe in Barneys” was scrawled in the background. Another featured a still of Sex and the City actress Sarah Jessica Parker as an early-’00s, hoops-wearing, Dior-saddle-bag-carrying Carrie Bradshaw peering lustfully into the Barneys window. (Post-sale, that Instagram account now lives under the handle of @TheSpiritOfBarneys.) I also read personal stories from Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez of Proenza Schouler and Narcisco Rodriguez about what it felt like to have their collections picked up by the fashion emporium for the first time. The designers were emotional. Being in Barneys meant they had made it and, from that point, their careers would take off. With the barrage of these articles, the Instagrams, the hashtags, I started to realize that Barneys really was the place to be. (Or at least it had been, at some point in time.) But a confession! I had never really been to Barneys. I once went to a private area of Barneys to interview a store-stocked designer. That day, I had gotten lost after plugging “Barneys” into Google Maps, and ended up outside of the company’s stark corporate building somewhere in Midtown. But I had never browsed through its nine floors and never loitered around the makeup counters for free samples. I don’t have one of those black Barneys bags with its white, impeccably designed font. The paper looked sturdy and sheeny. It was reusable, something a person could use to transport a gift in. It seemed special. Realizing that this was the end for the store, like making peace with an estranged relative on their deathbed, I decided to make a last-minute, pre-mortem tour of Barneys. I couldn’t not go at least once. Going to Barneys was just a thing that people did when they got to New York, like order a pastrami sandwich at Harry and Sally’s horny table at Katz’s Deli, or schlep to the Statue of Liberty on a ferry. I invited a seasoned shopper friend to come with me before the sale was finally announced. It was raining horrifically, but I braved the ankle-high water in Brooklyn to Manhattan’s Madison Avenue. When my friend and I entered, the mood was eerie. Perhaps it was the torrential downpour that deterred everyone from shopping, but it felt like it was only the two of us in the store. It was even—dare I say it—post-apocalyptic: The crowds of shoppers that once filled these nine floors had been whittled down to just my friend and I. Looking back, I hadn’t avoided the place because I was anti-Barneys. The truth is that I steered clear of all the major New York City department stores. To me, Bergdorfs, Saks, Neiman Marcus, and the rest exist in my mind as one globbed-together shopping entity. I never had an interest in spending an exorbitant amount of money on clothes, and I don’t get a kick out of sticker shock. Why would I want to look at stuff I couldn’t own? Maybe it’s all aspirational, about dreaming that, one day, I eventually could own it—but I’m a realist. I have a gargantuan student loan that eats away at my shopping budget (not to mention my soul). Then again, maybe Barneys was never about the shopping but rather the scene. Maybe it was just for slick Gwyneth Paltrow types (her A Perfect Murder era, obviously) poking through the racks of buttery black coats. Maybe Gwyneth herself went! Further exploration of the store showed a few signs of life. (No elegant Paltrow types, though.) On the second floor, there was a Hasidic mother and daughter quietly trying on jackets. On another floor, one woman was getting something personally tailored. She felt like a regular—her hair perfectly coiffed despite the rain and in some understated uptown look that consisted of nameless jeans, sneakers, a windbreaker, and a mammoth golfing umbrella. The other floor had a handsome, tall, but blandly dressed man jabbering on the phone, probably a father who worked on Wall Street, browsing the shoes. “It’s a place where rich dads go,” my friend said. It wasn’t completely dreary, however. The ample space allowed us to freely browse, and we were happy just to gawk at the new collections. Riccardo Tisci’s Burberry logomania! The delicious hues of Sies Marjan. We were seeing up close and in person what we had only glimpsed on the runway. I tried on one thing, a gray robe coat from The Row. It was soft, like it had been sheared from the goat mere seconds ago. The price was five times my rent. Toward the end of our adult field trip, I was wondering what I was trying to discover at Barneys. Physically? Emotionally? I wanted the feeling of having some sort of New York experience, like getting flashed or barfing out the window of a cab. But I hadn’t felt anything: I was at a gigantic department store that was really clean and really empty. I was in the back seat of the Death Star, but for cashmere cardigans. When we finally reached the top floor, people were digging into $38 salads at the famed restaurant Fred’s, and I finally felt a flicker of excitement. Maybe it was because I could actually afford to buy something from this floor—even if that thing was a backgammon board, or a Georg Jensen creamer—but I felt more at home.  Maybe I’d be like Audrey Hepburn in Breakfast at Tiffany’s, but instead of engraving a Cracker Jack ring at Tiffany’s, I’d walk out of Barneys with a snakeskin coaster. (Just one!) The $45 thingamajig would be my souvenir to make up for years of not shopping there. I’d like to say that I walked out with the coaster. A receipt of some sort. Nonetheless, I left empty-handed, and did not feel remorseful about not getting it. Though, for the first (and inevitably last) time in my life, I had just spent the day at Barneys. Still, I really wish I had gotten a bag. Those were pretty iconic. Luxurious, even.

 Coat season is officially here, and if a puffer jacket is too sporty, or this season’s wool wrap coat too minimalistic, there’s sure to be a shearling coat to suit your cold-weather style needs. Shearling coats have been a winter wardrobe staple since, well, forever, and these cozy coats are as cool as they come. They’re sturdy and durable, which makes them as practical as winter parkas, while their timeless look suits all styles and ensures they will hold their own no matter what the current seasonal trends may be. Plus, their reputation for timeless style makes them the perfect investment piece—an important fact to consider at a time when shopping for items that you can love and own for years, and perhaps even pass down one day, has never been more important. Better yet, investing in a shearling coat doesn’t have to cost a month’s rent—here, 24 shearling coats and jackets to buy now and bundle up in forever, all for $500 or less. Timeless silhouettes like the aviator or biker jacket are the perfect starter for a shearling coat investment. Bundle up in a classic brown or black version this winter and for many more to come: These are styles that will only look better with time. Even Kim Kardashian West was spotted wearing one last week in New York. What’s a better investment than a coat you can wear two different ways? These reversible jackets are the heavyweight champs of shearling coats. Wear them with their shearling lining exposed, or switch it up for a teddy-jacket look. Trench coat enthusiasts rejoice—this classic style gets a cold-weather update in the form of shearling-lined beauties. Buckle up in one this season for a sleek take on the sherpa jacket. For a lighter jacket that still brings the heat, shearling-lined or trimmed truckers are the perfect balance of casual and comfortable, and warm enough for the winter months. For the ultimate warmth, snuggle up in a teddy coat this season. Their elongated hem will keep your legs warm too, while their oversize fit makes layering sweaters underneath easier and more comfortable than ever. From shiny patents to blushed suedes, these boxy zip-ups are the ultimate shearling jackets for the urban jungle—a modern take on the cozy staple that looks good with everything from jeans and boots to warm winter dresses.

 By now, it’s no secret that Justin and Hailey Bieber are the masters of couple style. Well before they tied the knot, the duo cultivated a united fashion look that’s all about riffing off of each other’s individuality. Justin’s skater style, often complete with his own Drew House pieces, goes hand-in-hand with Hailey’s edgy designer wardrobe. However, the singer and model are increasingly dressing more and more alike with matchy-matchy outfits, too—something they proved once again this weekend in Beverly Hills during a casual bike ride together. Taking a stroll around the block, Justin and Hailey’s bike ride fits were deliberately coordinated. Justin steered while wearing a graphic “No Tears” tee by his own brand, with baggy khaki trousers and brown suede low-tops. Of course, he didn’t forget to include one of his signature Drew House pieces: a logo-emblazoned pink beanie. Meanwhile, Hailey rode in the back seat wearing a cropped striped tee by Joah Brown and high-waisted trousers, also baggy in fit, with a pair of Vans Sk8-Hi low-tops. Her cross-body leather bag also kept her hands free to wrap around her husband during the ride. Ah, young love—who knew it could be so cute and so cool at the same time?

 This past weekend, Gisele Bündchen stepped out in New York City to grocery shop wearing a beige sweater, a cropped white shearling puffer coat, and light-wash flared jeans; then, for a more city-minded touch, she opted for a pair of well-worn white sneakers. But while it is 2019, the perpetually fresh-faced Brazilian bombshell could easily have been stepping out of a time capsule from the early ’00s. Bündchen has abided by an über casual off-duty look from the very beginning of her modeling days, whether she was biking with Leonardo DiCaprio in a tank top, jeans, and flip-flops or even heading out at night in scuffed-up Converse. Her casual, pared-back outfits are a far cry from the over-the-top, camera-ready street style ensembles of models today; in fact, it’s refreshing to see that a veteran supermodel knows her personal style so well that it has relatively remained unchanged for over two decades. The only detail that really tells us that Bündchen isn’t plucked out of a chic twilight zone? Her AirPods.

 It’s a wardrobe snafu that happens all too often: pairing your minidress with a pair of perfect sheer tights, then promptly discovering a tear. Those stealthy runs seem to appear out of nowhere—and even worse if you’re wearing an expensive pair from Wolford! But a snag in one’s hosiery doesn’t have to be such a mortifying deal-breaking experience (I’ve witnessed friends go as far as bringing a backup pair). In fact, singer Dua Lipa is making the case for fully committing to ripped tights instead. Lipa, who is making the promo rounds for her new single, “Don’t Start Now,” uploaded a photo of herself in Germany rocking her torn tights. “I’ve gone through four pairs of tights with this dress,” she wrote, referencing the leather mini dress with crystal studs she wore from Philosophy di Lorenzo Serafini’s Spring 2020 collection. (The hosiery must have gotten caught on one of the studs.) Now, ripped tights is a grunge-chic staple that’s been embraced by rockers such as Courtney Love and even designers like Alexander Wang, so Lipa further leaned into the sexy-tough aesthetic with mounds of chain necklaces, and a pair of strappy white Fenty pumps. Because that’s the beauty of fashion: if you rock a malfunction with confidence, it can be deemed a lewk.

 Leave the classics in the closet! Inspired by runway innovators, the world’s most stylish sought out alterna-chic gowns and off-beat suits for late-fall red carpets. At the CVFF awards, mom-to-be Ashley Graham turned heads in a custom body-con number from Christopher John Rogers, the night’s big winner. Her iridescent “wiggle” dress was as far from traditional maternity wear as it gets. More breathtaking and bold looks from the night? Bella Hadid in an Alexander Wang catsuit with built-in nipple rings, and Paloma Elsesser in JW Anderson’s draped and jeweled silk ensemble. Elsewhere, the sense of fashion as both directional and fun was the new normal—and how wonderful is that? Queen and Slim director Melina Matsoukas combined a crystal-embellished Wales Bonner blazer and Marine Serre logo’d moon tights for WSJ Magazine’s Innovators Awards, while Gigi Hadid’s ice blue Burberry look at the same event provided a chic, serene moment. Even Cynthia Erivo’s oomph-y pastel Versace gown for the Hollywood Film Awards seemed somehow more radical than ever thanks to the actor’s crown of golden hair spikes.

 Kim Kardashian West is the queen of vintage. The reality star and beauty mogul often revisits pieces from the ’90s in particular, favouring designs from Jean Paul Gaultier, Versace, Alaïa, and so much more. So it’s only natural that for the People’s Choice Awards tonight in Santa Monica, California, Kardashian West—who’s nominated for best Style Star and Social Celebrity—opted for yet another throwback look that evokes the decade’s signature minimalism. Hitting the red carpet with her mom, Kris Jenner, and sisters, Khloe and Kourtney Kardashian, Kardashian West opted for a vintage Versace number, one of her most-worn labels. “I’ve wanted to wear it for a long time,” she wrote of the dress on Twitter before the ceremony kicked off. The fitted snakeskin dress, with thin spaghetti straps and a hemline that extended to the floor, falls in line with the body-hugging shapes Kardashian West often favors on the red carpet (there’s a reason she launched her own shapewear line, Skims). With no flashy jewelry or surplus accessories, she proved that the right dress has a stand-alone power all of its own.

 After a long week in the office, there’s often nothing better than a cozy weekend wardrobe (especially on a lazy Sunday!). Though she’s hardly working a 9-to-5, model Hailey Bieber never fails to elevate that laidback, easy mood. Yesterday in Los Angeles, she stepped out in sweats that were anything but sloppy. Bieber’s take on athleisure began with classics gray sweatpants. She paired them with a cropped white tank top and Nike high-tops. The sporty ensemble gained a fashion twist with the help of statement accessories, including a sleek red shoulder bag, glittering hoops, and sparkling diamond necklaces. There was also a statement watch, and tons of rings (and a bellybutton ring, too). The end result was a look that was equal parts chill and chic.

 This week, many of the best Instagrams came courtesy of the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund Awards. Of course, there were the winners who shined—Christopher John Rogers posing with Ashley Graham after taking the top prize being a notable highlight—but there were also the attendees who showed off numerous stellar looks along the way. Bella Hadid, who arrived as the date of Alexander Wang, wore a body-clinging black catsuit—and it isn’t the first time Hadid has opted for the traffic-stopping feline style, having worn a similar style from the designer to the 2017 Met Gala. Another head-turning CVFF Awards look came from Ruby Aldridge, who attended as the guest of designer Hillary Taymour of the label Collina Strada; she documented the night with fellow model Grace Hartzel, while wearing a hypnotic—and eco-friendly!—print dress. Of course, the week wasn’t just about fashion insiders. Riding high from the release of her new single “Don’t Start Now,” Dua Lipa posed with a killer pout in a purple tweed skirt suit, topping it off with her signature Birkin, here emblazoned with the word “dealer.” Bold! All the way over in France, meanwhile, Chanel fit model Amanda Sanchez graced Instagram with one of her effortlessly chic selfies from the house’s HQ at 31 Rue Cambon in Paris. She kept it deliciously casual in a scoop neck hot pink shirt and wide-leg denim flares. Speaking of casual, we were also a fan of rapper A$AP Ferg’s comfortable army jumpsuit that came covered in patches. He posted a saucy image of himself in the garb right before he kicked off his Floor Seats tour in Pittsburgh, PA, while also revealing that he designed it himself, in collaboration with the artist Hidji. Ferg referred to it as his “jet lag suit,” but our question is: Where can we get one? Here, see the best fashion Instagrams of the week. https://www.instagram.com/p/B4iFtBJJvSn/?igshid=1gjk2vbjvlrju The latest fashion news, beauty coverage, celebrity style, fashion week updates, culture reviews, and videos on Vogue.com.

 When Tyler, the Creator started working with Converse on his Golf le Fleur collection in 2017, he was mostly reworking the brand’s classic One Star silhouette—while adding his now-signature flower logo and rendering the sneaker in suede pastels, whether it be soft pink, baby blue, or a dusty lilac. Now, though, Tyler’s announced a new Golf le Fleur design that is his most extreme yet: meet Gianno, the new super chunky, hiking boot-inspired sneaker that serves as his first completely original design for the brand. The shoe, which also takes inspiration from Converse’s vast archive of basketball sneakers, comes in a few different colorways—there’s a rusty brown, accented by a Klein blue, and one in light cream with hints of seafoam green. You can just as easily imagine Tyler hiking up a mountain in Giannos (thanks to their geometric tread), as you can envision one of his skater friends wearing them with a pair of baggy jeans. Leave it to Tyler to create a shoe that unites two distinct worlds. The latest fashion news, beauty coverage, celebrity style, fashion week updates, culture reviews, and videos on Vogue.com.

 If you don’t know the label Safiyaa, chances are you’ve seen its most famous dress: a blue cape-back gown worn by none other than Meghan Markle. Images of the Duchess on a royal visit to Fiji last year went viral almost instantly: This was the first gown she’d been photographed in since her wedding, as well as one of her first public appearances after announcing her pregnancy. But the dress itself left a lasting impression, too: the striking color (mirroring the Fijian flag); the elegant cape detail; the narrow, unfussy silhouette. A few decades ago, a royal tour would’ve mandated a ball gown and gloves, but this was a fresh, modern alternative. In fact, Markle looked comfortable. That sort of easy-yet-elegant balance is the core of Safiyaa, according to its founder Daniela Karnuts. Before she launched the line in 2011, she was working as the commercial director for a major fashion media company in London and found it arduous to curate a “work wardrobe” that felt both sophisticated and practical. “I was always looking for clothes that were dignified, but still comfortable, and what I found was either very expensive or very seasonal and trend-driven,” she explains. “You might find a beautiful dress, but it becomes the dress of the season, and by next year, everyone knows exactly what it is. Or it’s beautiful, but it doesn’t work for every woman’s shape.” She noticed men didn’t seem to have this problem. Instead of navigating a glut of choices, they could simply go to Savile Row and have a suit made to their every specification. “I wanted to make that available to women, with eveningwear and ready-to-wear made to order and in multiple colors to choose from,” Karnuts says. “I’ve always had the experience of finding a piece I loved and wishing I had it in five colors, so I’d have this wardrobe staple to mix and match.” She decided to start Safiyaa with 12 such staples: a few trousers, tops, jackets, cocktail dresses, gowns, and camisoles—simple, yet powerful-looking pieces in sculptural silhouettes. The assortment has since grown to dozens of styles, all of which are available year-round in 60 shades of her signature stretch-crepe. “It took me years to find the right fabric,” Karnuts says. “Women still want to be dressed up, but I don’t think they want to compromise on comfort anymore. This holds you in, but it has just enough elastane that it’s comfortable and molds to your body, and you don’t feel like you have to change immediately when you come home.” (An added bonus: The crepe doesn’t wrinkle, so women who travel frequently for business or pleasure have one less thing to stress over.) Still, the real differentiator is Karnuts’s manufacturing process. Every item is made to order in her Mayfair atelier, whether it’s a pair of trousers or an embellished evening gown, so she doesn’t stock inventory. Londoners can schedule private appointments to have something made for them, whether it’s a simple pair of trousers or a custom evening gown; Karnuts says her team “can do anything.” Many of her private clients are based outside of London, and once Karnuts has their measurements, they’ll simply place orders via WhatsApp. All of that personalization makes her price points impressive: She calls it “demi-couture at a ready-to-wear price point.” To wit, the gown Markle wore retails for just under $1,300 on Net-a-Porter. That’s still an investment, of course, but it’s substantially less than what many luxury houses will charge for a gown—and theirs likely weren’t handmade by a single person. Karnuts has been able to pull all this off by ignoring the typical fashion startup blueprint. She’s never invested in press or marketing, and doesn’t pitch her brand out to celebrities; until women like Markle and Michelle Obama made Safiyaa a recognizable name, her customers simply discovered the brand through word of mouth. (Obama’s team approached Karnuts, not the other way around, because they’d seen so many women in Washington, D.C. wearing the brand.) Instead of “front-facing” activities like runway shows and press, she’s focused on the “back end” of her business, refining Safiyaa’s unique on-demand manufacturing. A typical piece is made to order (usually by a single person) and shipped in less than a week, while fully bespoke items (i.e. custom, brand-new designs) take two or three weeks. That detail will be a key selling point for Karnut’s newest category: bridal. Karnuts is hoping to offer a modern, streamlined alternative to traditional wedding gowns—both in terms of the actual designs and the much shorter lead time. Six or nine months is the norm for a made-to-measure wedding dress, whereas Safiyaa’s ivory tuxedos and embellished columns can be done in just a fraction of that time. “Over the years, we had so many clients asking us to make their favorite dress in white, or we did bespoke gowns for them. Net-a-Porter asked us to do a special capsule of white ready-to-wear pieces for their Bridal edit, and I thought, why not build out a bridal collection of our best-selling classics? It’s a nice way to reinterpret our archives in white, but with new embroideries and embellishments.” The results include tuxedos, jumpsuits, and top-and-trouser combinations in Safiyaa’s usual crepe with new hints of sparkle. A sleek column with sculptural sleeves felt familiar, whereas other looks—a sparkling gown with a giant satin bow, or a long-sleeved dress in floaty chiffon—take the brand in a newer, softer direction. “I think a lot of women want to wear something like this down the aisle,” she says. “But even the bride who wants to wear a big gown for the actual wedding will need something [easier] for the rehearsal dinner or brunch.” Interested brides can shop the debut collection exclusively on Safiyaa’s website and on Moda Operandi.

 There’s a lot to get dressed up for during the winter holiday season. Thankfully, 11 Vogue editors have perfected at least one fail-safe outfit formula to help get you through the endless list of occasions: winter dresses. Between sweaterdresses ideal for weekend getaways, gala-worthy frocks, and date-night-appropriate black knit dresses, they each bring their own versatility, so long as they’re styled just so. A satin shirtdress can easily take you from the office straight to a holiday soirée, for example, with a quick swap from an ankle boot to a pair of glitzy heels. A printed cotton dress is as cozy as it is practical: Just add a chunky knit, throw it in your suitcase, and consider your Thanksgiving dinner outfit sorted. An above-the-knee puff-sleeve dress is the perfect pairing with this season’s beloved knee-high boot, according to one Vogue editor who isn’t quite ready to break out her tights. Don’t forget a strapless silhouette either: Layering a turtleneck sweater underneath offers a quick fix for day, while throwing on a blazer transforms it for night. Afraid of the cold? Two editors swear by the dress-over-pants look for the wintry months, whether it’s an effortless, flowy set of trousers or a pair of trusty leggings. Here, shop the 13 winter dresses Vogue editors are relying on this season, how to wear them, and where to buy them—no matter the occasion. Willow Lindley, accessories director I have been living in this silky-satin shirtdress from Kate Spade. It is the perfect not-so-basic basic and I love this length with boots. Alexandra Gurvitch, market editor I am obsessed with this keyhole cutout Bottega Veneta dress—it can work for the office, it can work for a date, and it can almost work at temple too. Emily Farra, senior fashion news writer The perfect shirtdress is so hard to find, but you can’t go wrong with Marina Moscone’s. I love the attention to detail on this one—the band collar, the deep cuffs—and am dying to wear it over pants or leggings this winter. Even better, it’s a dress I can wear all year round; once the weather warms up again, I’ll just swap out my boots for flat sandals. Alexandra Michler, director, fashion development I am very into this Khaite dress. Wear it with a lightweight T-shirt for the office, or with a blazer for cocktails. I love having one reliable staple I can wear all season. Steff Yotka, fashion news editor I can’t stop thinking about this Story MFG dip-dyed dress with seashell embroidery. It’s happy enough to convince you it’s summer when daylight saving time has you feeling S.A.D. Anny Choi, market editor I love a great shirtdress for fall and winter. This one from Tory Burch is work appropriate, with a touch of romance. Ella Riley-Adams, senior living and beauty editor I’ve been coveting this corduroy maxi dress from the Vampire’s Wife, which I think would work just as well with Dr. Martens loafers and Kapital socks at the office, as it would with kitten heels for a Christmas party. It’s a rare dress that presents as both elegant and cozy. Caroline Griswold, market manager I love this Ganni dress with its chocolate hues because it pairs perfectly with all the other winter items I’ve been dying to pull out of my closet. I can’t wait to pair it with boots and a chunky knit, or dress it up with some gold jewels. The fabric also makes it super easy to throw in your bag for Thanksgiving without fear of getting wrinkled. Madeline Fass, associate market editor For someone who’s quite particular when it comes to wearing dresses, there’s no better way to feel the most “me” than by using a dress as a layering piece. The super-low scoop neckline on Beaufille’s Nodus dress is ideal for wearing over both sweaters and turtlenecks, while the uneven midi hem allows me to effortlessly style a pair of trousers underneath and still add the bit of edge I need to feel comfortable. Not to mention, the whole look will keep me warm all season long, which is definitely a plus. Lauren Valenti, senior beauty editor I’ve always found picking a dress for a formal occasion tricky this time of year, but I wore Staud’s Natasha dress to a wedding recently, and it struck all of the right chords. Its halter neckline and structured bodice were sleek and elegant, while its billowy full skirt and side pockets gave it a cozy, sumptuous feel. Not to mention, the color—a rich burgundy is my choice shade as soon as there’s a chill in the air. Julie Tong, commerce editor I practically live in sweaterdresses during the winter, and this wool knit version by Proenza Schouler is currently my godsend. It fits perfectly over my petite frame without being too tight, nor loose, and hits at that perfect mid-length to show off my boots. It is made of 100% merino wool, which keeps me ultra-warm without being heavy. It’s my go-to dress for the office, weekend getaways, and even date night. Naomi Elizee, associate market editor I’m notorious for keeping the summer dream alive, and still rocking my short dresses throughout the fall and winter season. This Ganni dress is the perfect in-between-seasons dress and pairs beautifully with a knee-high boot. Lilah Ramzi, features editor I would very much like to spend the winter in this wallpaper-size houndstooth-patterned dress by Alexander McQueen. It’s mostly wool so it will keep me cozy, plus there’s a scarf built right in. Ms. Burton has thought of everything.

 When Thom Browne invited Nesta Cooper to Miami for his art meets fashion fete, she knew she was in for a treat. The actress, who currently shares the screen with Jason Momoa and Alfre Woodard on the Apple + fantasy drama, See arrived ready for an experience and received just that. Treated to a first look at the designer’s debut art installation, Palm, Tree, I, a thrilling performance by Harriet star, Cynthia Erivo, and a star-studded dinner party in the center of the design district Cooper’s 24-hour trip was jam-packed, but that was only part of the fun. Brought into the immersive world of the brand, she made fast friends behind the scenes. “My favorite part of the experience was able to get to know the Thom Browne team,” shared Cooper post-event. “The energy there was amazing. Friendly, cool, and so open.” Those words could also be used to describe Cooper. A rising star who is currently experiencing a moment thanks to her performance on See and forthcoming roles opposite Salma Hayek and Owen Wilson, is refreshingly chill. Apt to compliment Tyson Beckford on his enviable seersucker suit or hang with pals like Riverdale’s Charles Melton, she enjoyed her brief taste of the city’s good vibes. “Miami seems like an absolute blast, and I wish I could have stayed longer,” she says. “It reminds me a bit of my home in Jamaica. Easy going and fun.” Here, Cooper takes Vogue along for her Thom Browne experience from pre-party facials to dancing the rain.

 The day that the theme of the Costume Institute’s spring exhibition is announced marks the beginning of months of wild speculation. Yes, fashion fans will discuss what sorts of magic Andrew Bolton, the Wendy Yu Curator in Charge of the Costume Institute, will whip up in the museum’s galleries, but also—and much more comically so—there is the issue of the Met Gala and its red carpet. Each year, guests of the ball are asked to dress according to a theme related to the exhibit. How will attendees grapple with this year’s show, About Time: Fashion and Duration, and the gala’s dress code: timeless? The internet had plenty of ideas. Some instantly took up Bolton’s reference material, Virginia Woolf’s Orlando and Sally Potter’s 1992 film adaptation, calling for Tilda Swinton–worthy corsetry and frock coats. Others looked to the cochairs—Lin-Manuel Miranda, Meryl Streep, Emma Stone, and Nicolas Ghesquière—calling out each star’s best, and most timeless, looks as inspiration. Still more have suggested commissioning flat circle costumes, which could either go full Nietzsche or, for a more pop cultural spin, channel Matthew McConaughey in True Detective. We won’t know if any of this will come to pass until May 4, 2020, but here are some of the internet’s best takes on the themes, as of now.

 While Kim Kardashian West might have hit the red carpet at this Wednesday’s WSJ Innovator Awards in a fashion-forward denim corset top and pant-boot combo, her morning-after look was far more down-to-earth—and concrete jungle-ready. Yesterday, she stepped out in a classic New York street style look, wearing a cold-weather coat of oversize black shearling over a tight brown top. For a touch of something sleeker, she opted for Helmut Lang patent leather pants; then, to ground the look, a pair of hiking-style boots. Kardashian West’s Big Apple daytime ensemble was a far cry from the body-hugging, barely-there styles that she sports in the warmer climes of her home in Calabasas, California. We often see the reality-star-mogul in curve-skimming outfits, from Versace archive dresses, to skin-baring Mugler bodysuits. Nevertheless, even with her seemingly down-to-earth New York street style moment, Kardashian West didn’t skimp on that West Coast glam: She accessorized the casual city-minded get-up with none other than a gleaming red croc Hermès Birkin bag. You can take the girl out of Calabasas, but you can’t take Calabasas out of the girl.

 You might know her best as one of the most promising young actresses in Hollywood, but Hari Nef got her start in the New York City fashion ratrace. Back in 2012, she was an intern at Vfiles along with Vaquera’s Patric DiCaprio (who is also a former recipient of the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund Award). In her role at Vfiles, Nef spent her days toiling away backstage at New York Fashion Week shows, lacing up models’ Converse sneakers, among other menial tasks. Nef’s presence at the 2019 CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund Awards felt like quite the full-circle moment for the intern turned actress. She still retains close ties to the fashion world, and says a lot of her designer friends have benefited from this awards event—whether they’ve won the top prize or not. For the occasion, Nef chose a ruffled black Brock Collection gown from a rack full of previous CVFF-award winners (that was curated by Vogue’s Market Editor Alexandra Gurvitch). Despite the glamorous milieu, Nef said the evening felt to her more like an intimate family affair. “As far as I’m concerned, I’m going to a very prestigious barbecue where a very lucky designer is going to get awarded a very prestigious rack of ribs.” That’s certainly one way to put it. Hari Nef in Tiffany T Two circle pendants in rose gold and gold, Tiffany T Two circle earrings in black onyx and gold, Tiffany T wire bracelet in gold with black oynx, Tiffany T wire bracelet in rose gold with mother-of-pearl and diamonds, and Tiffany T square ring in rose gold with mother-of-pearl and diamonds.Hari Nef in La Perla robe and slip dress; Vaquera dress; Proenza Schouler dress; Gucci dress; Brock Collection dress; Gucci coat; Brother Vellies boots; and Bienen Davis bag.

 Yes, they moved: Vanessa Beecroft had declared herself unsure before as to whether the ballerinas who were featured alongside a street casting in her performance piece for Moncler tonight would be directed to remain static, as is customary in her work. In the end, she opted for movement. A huge, densely packed crowd that intriguingly included Michèle Lamy as well as Marcelo Burlon and pretty much every fashion haunter in Milan made like sardines to get a glimpse of the Beecroft performance and its 43 slowly stretching dancers and models in vintage Moncler pieces. They were also here to see the newly-opened House of Genius, a retail expression of Moncler’s multi-collaborative Genius project. These spaces—there are two more in Paris and Tokyo—have been designed by Genius member, long-time Moncler designer and Palm Angels founder Francesco Ragazzi, who said the idea was to evoke the back-of-house storage area of a major museum. “I wanted to create this sensation of work in progress, and to reflect all the different designers’ different aesthetics together in a space that you can transform. So we worked to transform that into a reason for people to come into the store, explore, and buy. Because for me the question ‘why should you go into the store?’ is important right now. Of course the product is important ,but if you can buy it on the internet, why go into the store?” Ragazzi and Moncler’s answer to that is experiential. This Milan store and its sisters will host a series of workshops and events such as tonight’s from Beecroft. The stores also contain unique products which Ragazzi commissioned each designer to contribute—his are a Palm Angles x Moncler Zippo and water bottle—and cool vending machines from which you can buy yourself a Craig Green x Moncler T-shirt, for instance. There is also a lot of gateway merch, micro-products like rubber bracelets and stickers that allow you to purchase a souvenir from the visit even if you haven’t got the financial muscle to pick up a Simone Rocha. Moncler’s governing genius Remo Ruffini, chilling shortly before the event with one Spritz and two IQOS at Marchesi, said: “The House of Genius is where we show everything we showed you guys at the first presentation in February, with all of the collections together. It’s about attracting people and explaining this concept, that we have all these different Genius designers who are expressing themselves in one project.” Speaking of Moncler’s February Genius presentations, the presence of Lamy drove me to wonder whether a certain cleavage-flashing American in Paris fashion maestro might be lined up to join Ruffini’s crew. That would be complete Genius. The latest fashion news, beauty coverage, celebrity style, fashion week updates, culture reviews, and videos on Vogue.com.

 The Friends cast wasn’t kidding when they said they’d be there for each other. It may be 25 years since the hit NBC sitcom first debuted, but the gang from Central Perk remain close to this day. Case in point: the SAG-AFTRA Patron of the Artists Awards last night in Beverly Hills, where the show’s leading ladies reunited on the red carpet in support of their co-star Jennifer Aniston. Not only did Courteney Cox and Lisa Kudrow come out to toast Aniston—the actress received the foundation’s Artist’s Inspiration Award, honoring her philanthropic work with organizations including the American Red Cross and St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital—but they did so in style. While it’s impossible not to think of Rachel, Monica, and Phoebe when they get together, over the years, the trio of actresses have developed their own distinctive fashion identities. Last night, Aniston, Cox, and Kudrow were well matched in sleek, matching shades of black and slate gray; but in her daring transparent lace blouse and diamond hoops, Cox was pure Los Angeles glam, while Aniston offered a new twist on her love of LBD’s in a ruffled dress with an illustrated pattern. Kudrow, meanwhile, kept it classic in a belted black wrap dress and jeweled pendant. Joined by Paul Rudd (another Friends alum) the night made for a nostalgic photo op—as well as a showcase of modern eveningwear worthy of a Hollywood night out.

 Selena Gomez can shut down a red carpet all by herself—but last night, at the premiere of Frozen 2, the actress and musician decided to bring along a little extra help. Joined by her little sister, Gracie Teefey, Gomez arrived at the Dolby Theater in a fantastical look from Marc Jacobs’s Fall 2019 collection. The sequin and feather cape plus floral dress combination was arresting when first worn on the runway by model Rianne von Rompaey, but Gomez and her stylist Kate Young found a way of taking the dramatic concept a step further, with Teefey sporting a special miniature version created just for her to create a truly “aww” inducing moment. The matching sister act made the most of their time at the premiere, posing with actors dressed as Frozen’s Princess Elsa, Anna, and Olaf, and sharing a sweet red carpet kiss—plus, of course, getting a first look at the most anticipated kids' film of the year. And while Gomez might have been radiant in her Marc Jacobs finery, accessorized with Pandora diamonds and pigtail braids, it was Teefey that stole the show, channeling all the wintry make-believe of Disney’s onscreen world. Thankfully, Gomez didn’t mind one bit. “[I] hope I’m officially the best big sissy ever now,” the star wrote on Instagram, post-event. “She was living her best life!” The latest fashion news, beauty coverage, celebrity style, fashion week updates, culture reviews, and videos on Vogue.com.

 On the eve of Pierpaolo Piccioli’s Valentino haute couture show in Beijing’s storied Summer Palace, the designer was walking through the improvised couture atelier—where most of the house’s tailors and seamstresses have been transplanted from the brand’s Palazzo Mignanelli HQ at the foot of Rome’s Spanish Steps—pointing out the many wonders created by these alchemists of cloth. The 45 masterworks designed by Piccioli but executed under the direction of Valentino’s brilliant premieres, or heads of the ateliers—Alessandra, Antonietta, Elide, and Irene—and their respective teams have been designed especially for this moment and with an eye to the bevy of glamorous, free-spending clients from the region. Piccioli, however, averred that it is “a real Italian haute couture collection—not anything to do with China. It’s important to keep your identity,” he added, “especially when you bring your culture to another world and use it to evaluate the diversities.” But alongside those diversities, Piccioli found dynamic synergies too. His inspiration board was filled with images of the masters of the early Italian Renaissance that he loves—Piero della Francesca and Fra Angelico among them—alongside photographs taken of the Summer Palace itself, and of portraits of the emperors and empresses who once ruled here, revealing unexpected aesthetic dialogues, “two moments of grandness of old cultures,” as Piccioli explained, “of history and heritage.” On the worktables, some of the very grand ball gowns, sheath dresses, and wide-leg pant ensembles were worked with elaborate intarsia and appliqué techniques to suggest the swirling brocades in a Bronzino portrait. Others took the leitmotifs of Valentino’s ultra-romantic work from the ’70s and ’80s—point d’esprit ruffles, overscale rose prints, and a passion for bows, as well as classic haute couture fabrics including gazar, cigaline, silk velvet, and duchess satins and failles—and amplified them into the extravagant volumes and dimensions that characterize Piccioli’s recent haute couture collections, which have been known to bring grown editors and global superstars alike to tears. “Today, Valentino—especially for young customers like in China—is daywear and streetwear,” Piccioli explained, hours before a lavish new David Chipperfield–designed store opening that was to be thronged with the country’s hippest young actresses and music stars. “That’s great to get the brand alive and to face reality, but I also like the idea of the extravagance and boldness and uniqueness of the couture. Today, Valentino is streetwear and couture, and the two work together to create a new way of being. Modernity to me is about this high-low, present and past, couture and streetwear, all treated with the same sensibility, the same kind of daring and fantasy.” In homage to the Valentino haute couture craftspeople, the run of show noted the names of all those who had worked on the respective garments, along with some salient details that emphasize the “uniqueness” that Piccioli was talking about—facts and figures laid down in print that take the breath away. A dress entirely covered in hundreds of shaded pink bows of various sizes required 350 meters of fabric, for instance; a voluminous ball gown composed of ruffles of cherry red point d’esprit—600 meters of tulle in total—took 1,300 hours to complete; and a silvery dress and balaclava were entirely embroidered in more than 32,000 silvery sequins (for the show, beauty maestro Pat McGrath silvered the model’s face to match). Meanwhile, an intarsia opera coat composed of swirling sections of Oz green sequins, ivory wool, and soft pink crepes—eight different types of fabric in all—worn insouciantly over wide pants and a turtleneck top in a smaller-scale version of the pattern took a cool six and a half months to complete. Small wonder that Piccioli dubbed the collection “Valentino Daydream.” The clothes looked magnificent enough in the final moments of assembly on the workroom tables, but the following evening, in the atmospheric, high-ceiling rooms of the Aman hotel in the bucolic grounds of the Summer Palace, and before an audience of local clients in statement gowns from the designer’s last collection, their commanding volumes, idiosyncratic colors, and superb detailing made for a presentation as stirring as the operatic arias—“Je veux vivre” from Gounod’s Roméo et Juliette, and “Vissi d’arte” from Puccini’s Tosca—that opened and closed the show. “I have lived for art,” sang Tosca, an appropriate cri de coeur as the bride stepped out in a dress and hood entirely covered in trembling tendrils of flowers glittering with beads and sequins: a Midsummer Night’s Dream made real.

 As the temperature continues to drop, your choice of stylish work shoes becomes more and more limited. Boots aren’t the easiest to style with tailored trousers — do you tuck them under or over? — and who wants to commute in painful stilettos? The trick, according to Vogue staffers, is in finding the right elevated basics. Think heeled loafers that give you a little extra height without sacrificing comfort and chic flats in velvet, or croc-embossed leather, or even a cow print. Whether you are a freelancer on the go or a 9-to-5 cubicle dweller, there are plenty of editor- approved pairs here to choose from. Fashion Director Virginia Smith’s classic black chelsea boot is a closet staple that will last you for years. But there are more casual options — like $85 Converse Chuck Taylors, which Fashion News and Emerging Platforms Editor Steff Yotka swears by. On the dressier end of the spectrum, consider a cool chunky loafer by Labucq  — the choice of Associate Editors Madeline Fass and Naomi Elizée. Below, 25 pairs of comfortable fall work shoes to choose from, at every price point. Virginia Smith, Fashion DirectorThe Saint Laurent Chelsea boot is my go-to staple boot. I literally wore out my first pair and am now on my second—a third may be in order before winter is over. \ Nicole Phelps, Director, Vogue RunwayI look around at women wearing high-heel boots in the city and can’t believe that was once me. How did I do it? I’m much more practical and comfort oriented now. Frye is my go-to for sensible yet still cool fall footwear. These Moto Lace-Ups come with a special feature: a side zip that makes slipping in and out of them easy. And the price is right too. Chioma Nnadi, Fashion News DirectorI find that making the transition from summer to fall is always the toughest in the shoe department. I mean, who on earth looks forward to jamming their feet into closed-toe shoes after months of flat sandals? That’s why these Sies Marjan kitten-heel Chelsea boots have been a lifesaver. Though I’ll always love a good stomper, sometimes I yearn for a shoe that’s a little more posh. Thankfully, these boots check the box on comfort and style. Steff Yotka, Fashion News and Emerging Platforms EditorThere are no less than three pairs of Converse in my closet (and sometimes under my desk) right now, none better than the Chuck Taylor 70 high-top in black. There’s a reason this sneaker is (literally) timeless. Grace Givens, Jewelry DirectorYou can never go wrong with a comfortable flat from The Row! Emily Farra, Senior Fashion News WriterI wear ballet flats ’til there’s snow on the ground, and most of them are pretty casual: soft suede, round toe, and very worn-in! On days I want something a little dressier that isn’t a heel or boot, it’s really hard to find a pair of flats that feel elevated, but not too “evening,” and without crystal embellishments. Loeffler Randall’s new chocolate brown Simone flats are the perfect in-between shoe in my opinion: They’re more substantial than my day-to-day ballets, but aren’t at all “fancy,” with a slightly pointed toe and glossy croc-embossed finish that works just as well with jeans or a dress. Laird Borrelli-Persson, Archive EditorA long commute means I need cute wear-to-work shoes as well as wear-at-work heels. My hands-down pick is Stubbs & Wootton slippers. They add color—and a bit of joy—to getting dressed and out of the house on cold, frosty mornings. Zoe Ruffner, Beauty EditorNothing beats my shearling-lined Birkenstocks paired with a thick pair of black socks, but on the days when those are a little bit too casual you’ll find me in The Row’s Fara combat boots, which were my best sale score of 2018 (or perhaps ever). They’re low to the ground, so I can run from appointment to appointment without worrying about my feet falling off, while the discrete inner zipper means they’re 100% hassle free. Alexandra Michler, Director, Fashion DevelopmentI love these By Far boots. They are so clever because the lace is just decorative—there is a zip on the side for easy on and easy off. They are perfect with tights or jeans, and the block heel is great for stomping around the office! Willow Lindley, Accessories DirectorLoving a loafer for fall and have been living in this fun iteration by Tory Burch. Perfect for running around, except for the fact that people have been stopping me nonstop in the street to ask about them! Anny Choi, EditorI love a good loafer when it comes to fall office dressing. Jack Erwin launched women’s shoes recently and I have been living in them! Not only are they affordable, but they are such great commuter shoes. I’ll be styling them with socks when the temperature drops. Julie Tong, Commerce EditorMy go-to comfortable fall office shoes are undoubtedly my 3.1 Phillip Lim Agatha boots. They are sleek, black, and seemingly go with everything in my wardrobe—from midi dresses to skinny trousers. They feature an on-trend square toe and have the slightest kitten heel for a subtle boost. Madeline Fass, Associate Market EditorUsually, I love a heeled knee-high boot for fall, but it’s been difficult to justify any other footwear in the mornings when compared to the super-reliable, (and comfortable!) pairs of loafers I’ve had on rotation this season. There’s one for practically every day of the week—including a smart block heel, a sleek two-tone style, a cow-print slipper, and even an über-heavy lug-sole pair perfect for the upcoming winter months. The commute to the office and running between appointments is easier than ever—plus I love the boyish, laid-back look they provide to my otherwise petite, feminine silhouette. Naomi Elizee, Associate Market EditorNever thought I would become a girl who wears loafers, and yet here I am! Labucq recently released these amazing yet very comfortable pair of loafers, and I can’t stop wearing them. Doesn’t hurt that they’re python print too! Alexandra Gurvitch, EditorI tend to wear a lot of heels to work, but when my feet have had enough I still feel chic in these Mansur Gavriel ballerinas. Caroline Griswold, Market ManagerI’ve always been a big cowboy boot fan, I even still have a pair I’ve had since high school, so I immediately fell in love with this pair from Mango. I’m really into the black and white and Southwestern design that make them feel very authentic and chic. I know I will be wearing them all fall long with slip dresses and maybe even a Canadian tuxedo for a fully Western look. Lilah Ramzi, Features EditorI struggle with sensible footwear during the cold-weather months as I’m not a sturdy shoe kind of girl! I love these Repettos. The low heel means I can flit around all day in them; the bow detail reminds me of ballet, which brings me joy; and the patent leather means they’re rain and snow proof. Liana Satenstein, Senior Fashion News WriterI wore these Bevza boots so much that I actually put multiple holes in the soles. They have a low heel so easy to walk in, but a super-sharp square toe so they’re stellar polish for the office. Madeline Swanson, EditorMiista’s snakeskin Carlota boots are the perfect mod twist to offset my “Little House on the Prairie meets Sister Wives” fall wardrobe aesthetic—and their slight platform makes them extremely well suited for running between re-see appointments from dawn ’til dusk. In the words of Nancy Sinatra—the ultimate go-go icon herself—these boots were made for walkin!

 Liya Kebede’s 12-year-old label Lemlem has become a go-to destination for caftans, swim cover-ups, linen dresses, and other breezy, resort-y pieces you’d stuff in a suitcase for a last-minute trip to Kauai, say. In fact, it’s easy to imagine packing nothing else: The line’s beautiful colors, handcrafted details, and easy silhouettes have just the right casual-yet-special balance to go from a beach walk to a sunset dinner. Of course, there would be one major thing missing in your carry-on: a swimsuit! Kebede is taking care of that this week with her very first swim collection, available on Lemlem’s website now. “It’s a very natural progression for the brand,” she explains. “But it took some time to figure out what a swimsuit would look like in the world of Lemlem. For us, fabric is everything—we’re a handmade textile brand, but I wanted to use proper swim fabrics, not cotton [or crochet]. The challenge was how to incorporate [our aesthetic] for swimwear, and Lemlem-ify it, if you will.” She landed on the idea of transposing the label’s Ethiopian tubuh embroideries as prints, which appear on trims, belts, and straps throughout the collection. “It came out so wonderfully, we decided to do allover prints too,” she added, referring to the coral-dotted bikinis and striped halter maillots. As for Lemlem’s ambitious sustainability goals, Kebede pointed out that the dyes for the aforementioned prints are certified free of harmful chemicals. A typical bikini, on the other hand—particularly one in a super-bright or saturated color—is dyed with a cocktail of toxic substances, which could end up back in the waterways through your laundry machine (or, you know, swimming in the ocean). Next season, Kebede revealed her team is experimenting with fabrics by Repreve that are made from recycled plastic, and she’s overhauling Lemlem’s packaging and labels by swapping out plastic for compostable bags and introducing recycled paper labels. If you look closer, you’ll notice the new suits still have a touch of Lemlem’s signature texture: Instead of the usual slick, flat-looking swim fabric, Kebede sourced a French jacquard with a more tactile hand. She stressed the importance of maintaining Lemlem’s made-in-Africa ethos too, so that jacquard is shipped from France to Morocco, where each suit is stitched together in a woman-owned factory. “That makes it even more exciting,” she says. “The whole thing came together so nicely.” The collection is available now at Lemlem, with prices staring at $230, as well as at Net-a-Porter, Shopbop, Neiman Marcus, and specialty boutiques worldwide.

 Shia LaBeouf has been on a roll this year. The actor has upgraded his fashion sense to a level that few other Hollywood gents can reach. It’s his grimy, disheveled aesthetic—combined with the season’s sharpest suiting and statement shoes—that makes for an effortlessly cool look that never appears like he’s trying too hard. Take the square toe loafers he wore just a few days ago; if styled wrong, it could have been a ’90s disaster, yet he totally pulled them off with ease. Another tricky piece he’s making the case for this week? Too-short jeans. Today, the actor was seen in Los Angeles on his way to a taping of Jimmy Kimmel Live. And while his ensemble was more casual than the slick suits he’s been sporting on the red carpet, it was still a lewk. LaBeouf wore a pair of flood jeans that were cropped well above the ankle. Sometimes this silhouette looks like you left your jeans in the dryer for too long, but the actor made it purposeful, as if all he wanted to show off was his crisp white socks and dirtied low-tops. He wore the pants with a bright yellow crewneck and one wild necklace by Laurene Alvarado, which appeared to be a painted portrait inside of an ornate picture frame.

 Today, Kate Middleton and Prince William stepped out together in London to support the launch of the National Emergencies Trust, a new organization that focuses on responding to disasters in the U.K. For the event, the Duchess of Cambridge wore a dress by one of her favorite designers: Emilia Wickstead. The blue, long-sleeved  number featured a belted waistline. She accessorized it with a poppy brooch to honor Remembrance Day, as well as a streamlined clutch and simple black Jimmy Choo pumps, another favorite label of hers. But it was her jewelry that gave the ensemble a special touch. According to People, Middleton wore sapphire and diamond earrings that once belonged to Princess Diana. The earrings reportedly once featured a double-drop sapphire shape, though Middleton, who has worn the earrings before, appears to have modernized the style by opting for just one sapphire instead of two. It’s not the first time the Duchess has paid homage to Princess Diana via fashion; for Middleton’s tour of Pakistan last month, she incorporated several ensembles that harked back to the outfits Princess Diana wore during her trip of the country in the ’90s. Notably, Middleton’s engagement ring is also a family heirloom — it's the same ring that Princess Diana was given by Prince Charles.

 Contrary to golden foliage, or pumpkin spice–themed—well, everything—when it comes to fashion, the most important reason to love fall is simply because it’s the best time of year to layer up. Thankfully, this year, fall’s most important piece is the long-sleeve turtleneck. Whether it’s covered in eye-popping prints or just in a basic solid, the trusty knit was seen all over the Fall 2019 runways—worn underneath cropped sweaters at R13, slip dresses at Simone Rocha, and even making appearances at Chloé, Paco Rabanne, and Fendi. After all, turtlenecks are thin, but cozy; stylish, yet practical; and, when it comes to dressing warm, they look just as good worn alone as they do mixed in with the rest of your fall wardrobe. Whatever your fall aesthetic might be, there’s a turtleneck ready to complement it: from monochrome ribbed styles (the key to a prepster look when styled under a blazer), to frilly ruffles under a dress for a contemporary twist on classic Victoriana, or even as a means of mixing in more cutting-edge prints for seasonal trend lovers. Here, 24 choices (and four reasons) why you need to add at least a few of these turtlenecks to your rotation this fall, and throughout the winter months. You’ll be sure to thank us come spring. Basic layering begins with, well, basic layers. Investing in good quality, minimal turtlenecks—a wardrobe staple!—is a must for the fall and winter months. Available in fine-ribbed knits, stretchy cotton, and fitted cashmere, you can’t go wrong with these foundation pieces in versatile solids like black, gray, white, and even green. Feeling wild? These floral- and animal-print tops are the perfect pop of pattern for layering—or wearing alone if you’re searching for a statement-making look. Try a zebra-print top under a black blazer to start, then add some contrast with a layered floral-print turtleneck under a loud sweater; alternatively, spruce up a boring coat by sporting one on its own. Whether it’s flashing a full sleeve of print, or semi-exposed on a high neck, these printed styles are guaranteed to liven up any fall or winter outfit. Here’s a fall styling hack—this assortment of long-sleeve silhouettes goes way beyond your basic turtlenecks. Delightful details and atypical textures bring new meaning to the layering game. With technical printed pleats, animal-print-inspired velvets, and dramatic ruffled details around the neckline, these will be sure to give any fall outfit an added flair. Give a mock neck dress new meaning with a decorative blouse underneath, add some edge to a pinafore dress with a zip-front polo knit, or breathe new life into a coat by adding black velvet flounce sleeves. Both tie-dye and marble print were spotted all over the runways for both the current fall, and the upcoming spring, collections. Add a layer of the abstract-print trend to all of your seasonal looks for a splash of something cooler—and, of course, an easy way to hop on this seasonal style.

 Vanessa Beecroft is back in Milan—the city in which she was once an art student and where she presented her very first piece, VB1—to present a new piece later this evening in partnership with Moncler. Remo Ruffini’s outerwear label is everywhere right now thanks to its ongoing Genius collaboration projects, and tonight’s Beecroft performance will mark the opening of a new temporary Genius store in the soaring Belle Epoque retail cathedral that is Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II. A few hours before the show, Beecroft is to be found in the concrete exhibition space in the northeast of town. Flanked by assistants, she is softly skipping from one side of a trestle table to another, chewing nuts as she arranges her freshly shot Polaroids of the models and dancers cast in the performance ahead. Her dress is black and lightly crumpled from movement, her red hair a halo wildly ruffled from work. “Usually this process doesn’t exist,” she says of the photo editing. “I usually do photography just before the performance, live.” Tonight’s performance, however, will be presented in a public space, affording no opportunity for her to shoot it in situ before it is exposed to the audience. Beecroft’s métier is humanscapes, installations of individual humans who, en masse, contemplate the audience contemplating them. The casting of those individuals and the clothing they wear serve to inform the subject that Beecroft is exploring. Broadly this subject is human difference—difference in shape, difference in color, difference in gender—and our perception of it. First in the conventional contemporary-art world, then working hand in hand with Kanye West on Yeezy and other projects, and latterly through corporate collaborations such as this one, Beecroft has devoted her practice to interrogating prejudices and exposing vulnerabilities. Tonight’s performers will be wearing Moncler, naturally, but interestingly the jackets on the rails here are all vintage, a mishmash of pieces and styles. What is that about? Before she can explain Beecroft suggests we find a room away from the hullabaloo of preparation. It takes a few minutes, during which I glean that this is not an artist who confines herself to gnomic silence. Even before we sit down, she tells me that her English father, Andrew Beecroft, lived in London’s Holland Park, looked like Michael Caine, and “spoke to death every day.” Beecroft’s conversation is deeply unfiltered and sometimes as confrontational as the human vistas she invites us to gaze upon. Below, edited, is a written run-through of some of what she had to say. Your artistic medium is the people you cast, but is it fair to say that clothes have always played an important part in the tableaux you create? As I’ve repeated many times, I was raised with a little bit of discrimination towards fashion, from my mother and my family. However they were wearing black, they were wearing colors and choosing particular items, so they weren’t unaware of wardrobe. What was their discrimination toward fashion based upon? That was never explained to me. It was never clarified. But my intuition was that perhaps they think it’s vain. They were more monastic, but I was ashamed. I remember my first issue of Vogue, which I love, I bought and hid under a mattress. I remembered this recently while I watched the documentary about Franca Sozzani because the first issue I bought was the first issue that she did! So that was when I started discovering Helmut Newton, Steven Meisel, all those photographers, and the models, Linda Evangelista, Kirsten Owen. I started to rip out the pages and keep them. So wardrobe in my work is important. It almost creates a hierarchical system, so I use clothes to define. For instance in Brazil [VB50, 2002], the short girls were wearing flat Alaïa ballet shoes, the middle-sized girls were wearing midsize heels, and the tall girls wore tall heels to reiterate the injustice. From the beginning I cared for certain designers because their shapes were more beautiful. The look of a Manolo Blahnik shoe is very clean. In my work a shoe by Manolo became something else, a dress by Margiela became something else. Margiela burned a dress for me! So sometimes I’ve had the chance to do these collaborations. For this collaboration, then, why are you using vintage Moncler pieces? First of all I am against contemporary society. I don’t like new things. I like old—not necessarily vintage because I am a germaphobe, so I have a problem! But I like to adopt or inherit from other people. I also like old-looking sportswear. I love that faded look of vintage sportswear, so my first step was I went online to look for all the brown-beige shades, skin tones, in Moncler vintage. It was impossible to buy them because there wasn’t enough time. So Moncler went into their archive [to find these]. I wanted them to be distressed and used. Also because in today’s world I would rather recycle, use what we already have and repurpose it. At Kanye West’s Madison Square Garden show [for Yeezy], I repurposed I don’t know how many garments from Adidas and then dyed them in new colors. They came out purple and magenta, cyan, and crazy colors. So my immediate thought [for Moncler] was to use what was out there already. I wanted to do a ballet piece or a dance piece, but at the same time...maybe I was afraid of movement because I’m still stuck in the presentation of women without any further movement or action. I like the anticipation of the audience, also waiting, and then they’re not going to get anything, not even a movement. So it is a dialectic between the jackets and the bottom part that was more ballet or about a dancer. So there might be some movement? I don’t quite know yet! It’s difficult and outdoor, and I’m afraid of the audience, and so I’m not sure. I might leave it up to the girls to go up and down on their toes. That might be my choreography. Is your work about exposing vulnerability? When I present the woman to the audience, I still haven’t really resolved why I’m doing that. Exactly why. I’m not clear that the audience has understood why, so I’m still waiting to release that information. So you’ve never encountered anybody you feel understands your work? Absolutely not! I moved to the States purposely because I realized that was the country with no dialectic, no critical thinking. That was the country where I should do this work. But I realized through all these years there are certain issues like race and femininity that are going to move very slowly. Well, your work is about difference, and that can be confronting. I recently became a little bit discouraged when I realized that misogyny and racism and the combination of the two, they do not want to be resolved [in the U.S.]. In Europe, especially in Germany or Italy, my work was understood too much. So I decided to work in the States because there will be a dialectic. But instead they took it literally. So if I show black people, I’m racist. If I show women, I objectify them. And I don’t want to explain myself. One person recently asked me, “Why don’t you give us an explanation?” Because I’m not an intellectual. I’m an artist. I also want people to feel emotionally challenged and triggered. Are you working on any upcoming Yeezy projects? I don’t think…I haven’t worked on Yeezy in a while, but I don’t think he wants to do shows anymore. I think he wants to do his line like a classic, something that doesn’t need a show, which is nice because the anxiety of the constant consumerism tied to fashion: the production, the season, the stress. Instead create this, the classic pieces that I think he thinks are like Hermès. You get your cool thing that lasts you forever. You mentioned earlier a weariness and a wariness on your part when entering conversations about racism… I received a lot of criticism from blacks, from whites, from liberals, as if racism is a subject that you shouldn’t be talking about if you’re white and if you’re female. Kanye was the only one that actually supported me. You know, I always thought that one day people will really understand the work, but now I’m thinking maybe not, maybe in another century?

 Most designers today begin developing their collections by gathering images of clothes from decades past; few designers, however, are willing to admit it. Thankfully, Marie-Ève Lecavalier is perfectly open about rehashing the fashion of her childhood. The French Canadian designer—whose namesake label Lecavalier is inspired by the trippy style codes of the ’60s and ’70s—is all about bringing throwback style moments into the present, thanks to her firm emphasis on upcycling. “I was really, really bored,” Lecavalier says of growing up in the suburbs of Montreal, Quebec. She would often imagine living in alternate realities or eras, and picture herself as the characters populating the eccentric music that her parents, both musicians, were listening to (such as Walter Wanderley, an organist in the late 1960s). This quirky upbringing informs the consciously retro aesthetic she channels today. “I always felt like the weirdo and the outcast,” she said. “Still as an adult, I’m always living between reality and fiction. I’m always connected with this child that I was, weirdly.” Lecavalier launched the label in 2016, but her first official collection for Spring 2019 was swiftly picked up by the Montreal retailer Ssense. It included contemporary twists on the groovy spirit she grew up obsessed with, such as crocheted knitwear, wide-leg denim with leather edging, and oversized, masculine shirts covered in hypnotic, warped pinstripes (this wavy print is now a recurring motif in her work). The pieces were based on prototypes Lecavalier made while completing her master’s degree at the HEAD Geneva School of Art and Design in Switzerland, during which she interned with Raf Simons. (“Raf has a straight-to-the-point way of working with forms and shapes,” she says of what she learned from him.) Last year, buzz around Lecavalier grew after she won the Chloé Prize at the Festival d’Hyères in France, becoming even more feverish when, in 2019, when she was shortlisted for the LVMH Prize. Lecavalier’s latest Spring 2020 collection only reiterates her joy in throwing it back. The new line is inspired by ’60s cabaret movies and their glamorous leading ladies, with Catherine Deneuve in The April Fools serving as one of the collection’s primary references. Much like the dreamer mentality that underpins her broader creative outlook, the designer said these films provided her with a necessary sense of escapism as a child. “I love the stories of the adults [in cabaret movies], because they’re always leaving this stuck-up life to live their truth in the moment,” Lecavalier said. “When I was a kid, I was really shy. I couldn’t really express myself. The first way I started expressing myself was through dance.” The Spring offering is heavy on the mod-inspired charm that made the costumes of her chosen decade for inspiration so unique, reworking her signature swirly prints onto everything from oversized T-shirt dresses and turtlenecks to jersey tank dresses with matching gloves. Lecavalier also experimented with more structured shapes this season, whether adding a thick bustier belt to a pair of tailored white trousers, or slipping a corset overtop a slinky gown. Most importantly, perhaps, she also ramped up her use of upcycled fabrics, something the brand has focused on from the start—her new “Cabaret” dress, for instance, is made from circular leather scraps that were discarded by luxury fashion houses due to defects. Eventually, the designer hopes to make her brand fully sustainable, but for now, she is implementing as many upcycled fabrics into the line as possible. “As the new generation of designers, we need to find new ways to produce and create,” Lecavalier said of her growing focus on the brand’s environmental footprint. “Especially with leather, there’s so much rejected within the industry that you can buy it for really, really cheap prices. I like the idea of creating something unique, precious, and expensive with stuff that people didn’t bother to use.” You’ll definitely want to bother, however, with keeping your eye on Lecavalier—and her quiet conviction that what’s old can always be new again.

 The slip dress is one of those classic pieces that never goes out of style. Paired with a leather jacket or combat boots, it’s got a cool, grungy feel; dressed up with a heel, it’s suddenly ready for evening. But seasonally, the slip dress is more at home in summer than fall—its silky, lightweight construction can make you feel a tad chilly in the cooler months. But leave it to the stylish Katie Holmes to show just how to wear it this season. Last night, the actress, who has been on a winning fashion streak lately, stepped out in New York City wearing a weather-appropriate take on the slip dress. She wore a long-sleeved maxi style by Philosophy di Lorenzo Serafini. The gray dress  had a delicate lace trim along the slit. Shen then styled the elegant piece with a hefty wool overcoat and zebra-striped knee-high boots by Khaite, her favorite label of the moment. These two fall-ready pieces perfectly warmed up the slinky dress. When you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.

 Last night, Kim Kardashian West and husband Kanye West hit the town in New York City, where they were on hand to deliver Burberry designer Riccardo Tisci his WSJ Innovator Award. The stylish duo appeared on the event’s red carpet together—but even before the ceremony began Kardashian West was already turning heads on the street. The reality star-slash-business entrepreneur debuted fall’s most daring shoe: the pant-boot. (Suddenly, summer’s risky flip flop heels seem so tame.) Kardashian West’s hybrid piece—the whole outfit was custom-designed by Burberry—is worth a double take. Part denim, part leather, this Frankenstein-esque garment certainly must have saved a step when getting dressed. She wore the pant-boots with a denim corset top that fell off the shoulder with puffed sleeves, which provided a nice contrast to the painted-on pants. But it was those leather chaps with built-in stilettos that really made Kardashian West look like she was dressed for a high-fashion rodeo.

 There are two ways to look at all the matches that Serena Williams has ever competed in. Most obviously, they stand as some of the greatest tennis ever played—lightning serves, ground strokes with the power of ocean currents, a forehand as formidable as her double-handed backhand. Williams herself, though, sums them up in exactly one word: hearts. “I am obsessed with hearts,” she says. “If you go back and look at photos, pretty much all my matches—99% of the time—you see me wearing some sort of heart necklace.” If you do go back, you also notice that she is wearing necklaces and earrings, bracelets and rings—all manner of accessory, in fact—with an enthusiasm that might make the layperson wonder: How do you accessorize like that when you’re competing at a kind of outer-space level? Not a problem, according to Williams. “I remember a long, long time ago I wore this diamond star ring on my right hand that everyone looked at and was like, ‘How do you play wearing that?’ ” She’d purchased it at 17, her first self-bought piece. “It wasn’t anything super-fancy—it had a really interesting shape; it almost looked like a starfish, but with four arms instead of five. But it was fine. I’ve always worn crazy jewelry on the court—massive rings, diamonds, necklaces. I mean, most people like jewelry, but I love jewelry.” It will come as no surprise, then, that Williams’s new line—called, simply, Serena Williams Jewelry and on sale starting this month—includes hearts, along with rings, bracelets, and necklaces, a diamond-encrusted dog tag, and diamond earrings that spell out SEXY as well as LOVE, the words broken in two. There are 70 core pieces, ranging in price from $299 to $10,000, and as much as the line is a dream come true
for Williams, it’s also practical: As she’s allergic to a lot of metals, she wanted pieces designed with real gold or silver but still “price-friendly.” She was remembering this the other day while driving around Palm Beach, Florida, and wearing five pieces from her new line: a diamond necklace, another necklace with sexy spelled out in diamonds, and some signet rings. She’d had them on nonstop for a week or so, having just flown in from New York and before that L.A. (“I’m a little bit everywhere”), and she was saying that her collection is also about travel—about the sort of pieces that might easily move from a baccarat table in Monte Carlo to takeout café con leche in Miami’s Little Havana, or “on the red carpet and the tennis court,” as she puts it. “You don’t have to change pieces, but you can add pieces—something more bold, or more strong, or even something with a word on it—even if it’s a more delicate piece. It’s just about expressing yourself.” How involved was she in the design process? “I’m not a jewelry designer,” she says, “but I spent hours looking at every single piece. I’d say, ‘Let’s change the chain on this’ or ‘Let’s do a herringbone here’ or ‘Let’s do more of a classic look for this or a different finish for that.’ ” What’s her jewelry mood at the moment, generally speaking? “Right now I’m loving anything with a frosted look, like the AP watches I’ve been wearing lately. I also love layering delicate little necklaces because by themselves they’re subtle, but when you add a few you’re making a statement. I also love layering my thin bangles with tennis bracelets—when you don’t have to stick to one style or one piece, it allows for more freedom, which I love.” While cruising through Palm Beach, she was also remembering her greatest accessory inspirations: her mother, Oracene Price, who favors gold; her four sisters; her grandmother; and her aunt. “Their ability to play with accessories and use different statement pieces has always had an influence on me,” Williams says. Though her mother favors gold, bangle bracelets and hoop earrings are a theme for all of her relatives. “It’s amazing how each of us are influenced by each other—yet our style remains unique,” she says. Williams intends to keep the family tradition moving forward: Her husband, Alexis Ohanian, has proven himself to be skilled at gifting inspirational jewelry to her. But nobody, it seems, knows her accessories game quite like her sister Venus. “She definitely doesn’t miss,” Serena says. “Anything she gives me, I love.” The latest fashion news, beauty coverage, celebrity style, fashion week updates, culture reviews, and videos on Vogue.com.

 The year 2020 is a milestone for the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The New York institution will celebrate its 150th anniversary with a series of exhibitions, many of which will put the spotlight on masterworks in its collections, as well as new acquisitions made as part of the 2020 Collections Initiative in honor of the anniversary. In keeping with the year’s theme, today the Met announced that the Costume Institute’s spring exhibition will showcase a century-and-a-half of fashion history culled from its archive and presented along a “disruptive” timeline. “About Time: Fashion and Duration,” says Andrew Bolton, Wendy Yu Curator in Charge of the Costume Institute, takes a “nuanced and open-ended” approach. “It’s a reimagining of fashion history that’s fragmented, discontinuous, and heterogeneous.” Bolton found inspiration for the exhibition in the 1992 Sally Potter film Orlando, which was based on the time-traveling Virginia Woolf novel of the same name. “There’s a wonderful scene,” he says, “in which Tilda Swinton enters the maze in an 18th-century woman’s robe à la Francaise, and as she runs through it, her clothes change to mid-19th-century dress, and she reemerges in 1850s England. That’s where the original idea came from.” Virginia Woolf acts as the show’s “ghost narrator,” with quotes from her time-based books including Orlando, Mrs. Dalloway, and To the Lighthouse appearing throughout the exhibition, not unlike how Susan Sontag’s quotes guided viewers through this year’s Camp: Notes on Fashion show. The philosopher Henri Bergson, whose concept of la durée—time that flows, accumulates, and is indivisible—also provided some of the show’s framework. In addition, Michael Cunningham, whose novel The Hours, a postmodernist reading of Mrs. Dalloway, won the 1999 Pulitzer Prize, will contribute a short story to the exhibition’s catalogue. “What I like about Woolf’s version of time is the idea of a continuum,” Bolton says. “There’s no beginning, middle, or end. It’s one big fat middle. I always felt the same about fashion. Fashion is the present.” It’s human nature to compartmentalize, to, as Bolton says, “look back at history with homogenous eyes.” Indeed, in a video clip shown at Karl Lagerfeld’s memorial in June, Lagerfeld said: “Clothes are the first thing you think of when you imagine an era—you think of pannier dresses when you say the 18th century, before architecture or anything else.” Bolton’s mission with About Time is to challenge and complicate this tendency, and to get us to think differently about fashion history. To do so, he will divide the 160 women’s garments in the exhibition into two sections or “timescales.” The first is a linear timeline of black looks. “It’s a very rational, regulated chronology of fashion from 1870 to 2020, the timescale of modernity,” Bolton explains. The second grouping presents what the curator describes as counter-chronologies, mostly in white ensembles, though there is also likely to be bursts of color in places. “You can see them as folds in time,” he says. In a press release, Max Hollein, director of the Met, elaborated on the concept: “This exhibition will consider the ephemeral nature of fashion, employing flashbacks and fast-forwards to reveal how it can be both linear and cyclical.” Bolton will highlight a variety of “folds in time.” They could include comparisons between two designers of different eras, like Alaïa‎ and Vionnet or Poiret and Galliano. “Or it might be juxtapositions between two designers from a certain period who were competitive, and one survived and one didn’t,” like “Chanel and Patou in the ’20s and Rei Kawakubo and Georgina Godley in the ’80s.” It’s useful to think of these “counter-chronologies” or “folds” as connections. Bolton makes them across shape, motif, material, pattern, technique, and decoration. Among his favorites: the relationship between a black silk faille princess-line dress from the late 1870s and an Alexander McQueen “bumster” skirt from 1995. “Over the years, McQueen continually worked with this elongated silhouette—the princess line basically—and I’ve always felt that the bumster was the most radical version of the way he achieved it.” He continues: “What the dual timelines try to unravel is that tension in fashion between change and endurance, and transience and permanence. Ultimately, I think it advocates for a slowing down of fashion.” The exhibition, which will be presented in the Met Fifth Avenue’s Iris and B. Gerald Cantor Exhibition Hall, will be made possible by Louis Vuitton. Bolton is working with Es Devlin, the visual artist and stage designer, on the exhibition design. “I’ve long admired her work and wanted to collaborate with her,” he says. “This theme seemed most suitable for her, she’s done several of what she calls mirror mazes and she often refers to the complexity of time with her design process.” The cochairs for the gala on Monday, May 4, will be Nicolas Ghesquière, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Meryl Streep, Emma Stone, and Anna Wintour. About Time: Fashion and Duration will be on view at the Costume Institute from May 7 through September 7, 2020.

 Last night, Coach hosted a private screening for the upcoming film release Mickey and the Bear in Los Angeles, California. The movie, which arrives in cinemas on November 13, stars actress Camila Morrone: who is also featured in Coach’s new holiday campaign alongside Megan Thee Stallion, Yara Shahidi, Kate Moss, and more. For the special premiere, Morrone documented the getting-ready process exclusively for Vogue. “I wanted to do something for the screening that was totally different than what the guests were going to see on screen,” said Morrone of her red carpet look last night. “I always like there to be a contrast to what I am playing. . . so I went for an edgy, effortless denim dress that I was able to be a little more fun with the makeup.” Even if the actress said she was “scared and terrified” of playing her character, a headstrong teen named Mickey Peck, her look for the special premiere was just as bold and independent. The getting-ready process began back in her hotel room, where Morrone’s glam squad got to work: together, makeup artist Ash K Holm and hairstylist Bryce Scarlett created a sultry, effortless beauty look on her that was perfect for the intimate screening. Then, it was time to slip into the night’s fashions. With the help of her stylist, Micah Schifman, Morrone chose a polished-but-casual denim dress from Coach’s Spring 2020 collection, dressing it up with black strappy heels and a standout accessory: a leather shoulder bag by the label, made in collaboration with Richard Bernstein, that featured an illustration of Barbra Streisand. After the look was set and finished, it was time for Morrone to head on out to the event, where notable guests—including the film’s director Annabelle Attanasio, Morrone’s co-star James Badge Dale, Naomi Campbell, Sofia Boutella, Suki Waterhouse, and more—sipped on cocktails and celebrated the stylish actress’s new starring role in the project. Below, see Morrone’s full getting-ready diary. The latest fashion news, beauty coverage, celebrity style, fashion week updates, culture reviews, and videos on Vogue.com.

 This year, Shia LaBeouf has been quietly proving himself as a breakout red carpet style star. In a sea of daring celebrities redefining and twisting menswear codes, including Ezra Miller, Lil Nas X, and more, the actor has levelled up his fashion sense in a stealthier way instead. Working with sister stylists Wendi and Nicole Ferreira to upgrade his look with modern suiting and statement accessories, LaBeouf’s recent heeled Gucci loafers served as a prime example of his confident new look. Last night, the actor continued this winning streak, attending the premiere of his new film Honey Boy in Hollywood, California wearing full look Balenciaga—and his stellar shoe game was out in full force again, too. LaBeouf wore a bright blue suit with a slightly oversized fit, pairing it with a tight floral-printed tee underneath (a combination he’s pulled off on the red carpet before). Then, he added a tricky ’90s-inspired shoe: black square toe loafers. Their chunky shape is the opposite of the streamlined, chisel-toe oxfords Hollywood men usually gravitate towards, but the shoe departure added a roguish twist to the outfit. His statement footwear aside—and not to mention that scraggly beard—the actor did adhere to one strict menswear rule, though: matching his belt to the shoes. So, call this winning look a case of him bending the rules—not breaking them entirely.

 Last night, the perpetually luminous guru of high-brow health Gwyneth Paltrow attended the opening of the 1 Hotel West Hollywood in a sharp black suit from her very own G. Label, artfully accessorizing the ensemble with a handful of layered gold necklaces and a simple pair of strappy sandals. While the look itself was polished and pared-back, it also had a hint of edge: Paltrow made the canny decision to go braless, fully embracing the diving décolletage of her self-designed suit jacket. Gwyneth die-hards will also notice that her sleek get-up is reminiscent of the beloved styles she wore throughout the ’90s, and continue to populate Instagram feeds to this day. After all, who hasn’t stumbled across a yesteryear Paltrow on the red carpet appearing angelic in a sleeveless black turtleneck, sans bra? Her black suit is something that wouldn’t be out of place in some of the actress’s most fashion-forward films; whether the wardrobe of her uptown, UN-employed character in A Perfect Murder, or the uber-minimalist garb she sported in the classic romcom Sliding Doors. This isn’t the first moment that Paltrow has channeled her own ’90s style, either. Two years ago, in a casual Instagram post, she wore an all-green outfit that directly recalled the famed Donna Karan blouse and slip skirt combo she wore as Estella in Alfonso Cuarón’s 1998 adaption of Great Expectations. This time, however, Paltrow’s look didn’t need any pops of color to turn heads—her sexy take on classic suiting more than stood out on its own.

 The Miami-based recording artist Suzi Analogue is in the midst of a world tour and has just unveiled a new video for “LOUDR,” her first foray into electropunk, which stars the professional skateboarder Beatrice Domond. While she is in demand across the globe—and will shortly take off for Seoul, where she will begin the Asian leg of her tour—Analogue is now in Kampala, Uganda, a city that she has recently devoted a lot of time and energy. She originally traveled to Uganda in 2015 as a cultural diplomat on behalf of a state department program called Next Level; there, she hosted a beat-making and production workshop at a youth center. She kept in touch with many of her pupils, even helping one launch a street-art festival. Earlier this year, one former student put Analogue in touch with the organizers of Nyege Nyege festival, a music festival with ties to a local record label. Analogue had wanted to go back to the city anyway, and she secured one of the festival’s month-long residency programs, which she completed in mid-September. In Kampala, Analogue worked with Ugandan artist and synthesizer maker Afrorack to create a new electronic instrument from recycled VHS tapes. She also collaborated with local designer Brian Sonko, who heads up the Kampala-based brand SONCO, on a custom kimono, which is one of her signature garments. Sonko’s sustainable designs rework the traditional Ugandan fabric called barkcloth, which, she says, is “traditionally a ceremonial fabric that’s actually made from a certain tree bark [the inner bark of the Mutuba tree].” Older generations know about the textile—it’s made using a prehistoric technique that predates even the invention of weaving—but younger millennials don’t. “He’s now pairing it with denim. He’s thinking of modern ways to use it,” Analogue says. Sonko met Analogue during her last trip to Uganda, and they bonded after he invited her over for a studio visit. “I already had my festival looks made by Suzette Guy, who creates all of my live outfits, but I thought it would be great to have something made here with the energy of this place,” Analogue shares. “We planned for a kimono, but one that told a story about Afro-futurism.” The two met up to gather textiles at the downtown market. Sonko created a piece with an athletic, surreal edge that fit Analogue’s future-leaning aesthetic well. “He even threw my logo on the back, which he got screen printed.” Since this initial collaboration, Analogue has been consulting him on his fledgling brand; Analogue says that working as a fashion designer in Kampala poses unique challenges, as the city’s fashion market is more geared to reselling American goods and secondhand clothing from other countries. “New designs aren’t what people gravitate towards,” Analogue says. “I just want to help him because he’s a really great designer.” Analogue felt like she solidified her connection to Uganda on her recent trips. When she performed at the festival, she enlisted the help of a beatbox crew called Human Audio, which is made up of 15 of her former students. For their joint performance, she outfitted each of them in one-of-a-kind pieces from an upcycled clothing collection that she made last year. “I left those pieces with them,” Analogue says. “It’s really just continuing African-centric innovation and diasporic collaboration—that’s really the center of my practice right now,” she says. “That’s really the center of my endeavors in general—just reconnecting the diaspora and the continent through art, music, and creative projects.” My first day building a synth-effect instrument in collaboration with Afrorack.

 While the flip-flop heel was the most controversial shoe of summer, Victoria Beckham is already throwing a new contender into the ring for fall: on multiple occasions now, the designer has been sporting her polarizing peep-toe stilettos, which straddle the line between a sandal and boot. It’s a tricky shoe—the knit upper is too covered for summer, not covered enough for winter temperatures—but Beckham has been fully committed to rocking the style on the streets. (They continue popping up in her collections, too.) And now, it seems she’s even bringing it to the airport. Yesterday, Beckham arrived at New York City’s JFK airport wearing a stretchy red pair, fitted tight to the leg. It’s an unexpected shoe choice; usually a slide sandal or sneaker is the go-to while catching a flight, for a smooth ride through the TSA screening process. The designer styled her favorite footwear with a typically posh ensemble, pairing an argyle wool sweater, layered over a button-up shirt, with a checkered, below-the-knee skirt. In her hand, Beckham also carried her chic take on a travel bag: a streamlined red leather tote, carried as a folded clutch. She didn’t forget her big sunglasses, either—after all, the paparazzi was waiting for her to land. Then again, in those eye-catching shoes, it would have been hard to travel incognito.

 Swedish-Iranian artist Snoh Aalegra’s style usually reflects her smooth R&B sound—just take the black-and-white cover of her sophomore album from earlier this year, titled Ugh, Those Feels Again, where she looks like a modern-day Sade. For the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund awards on Monday evening in New York City, though, she went in a more frothy direction thanks to Pyer Moss designer Kerby Jean-Raymond, who was also her date for the night. Jean-Raymond initially stumbled across Aalegra’s music a few years ago—the first song of hers that he heard was “Under the Influence”—but his respect for Aalegra goes even beyond her songwriting capabilities. “She pours herself and her resources into doing the most epic shows and videos possible,” Jean-Raymond says. “There’s an additional level of care that she puts into creating the world around her music, and I love that.” Aalegra’s been a fan of Pyer Moss for a while now too. “There’s a beautiful warmth about his collections,” she says, and that’s certainly true of the dress that she gravitated towards for the CVFF celebration: she attended the awards in a baby pink pleated gown that required two people to help her slip into (and out of). “The dress made me feel powerful and regal,” she says of her decision-making process. Jean-Raymond breaks down his reasoning a little differently when asked the same question: “Because she looks great in everything.” That might be true, but there’s something especially captivating about Aalegra in that pink pleated number—see for yourself in the exclusive photo diary that she’s shared, below. Hair and makeup by Nigella Miller and Theo Turner. YEERRRRR. Final touches. Getting into this beautiful creation by Pyer Moss takes teamwork! This necklace, though! Chose the Lil’ Kim earrings for the night. Time heals all—including heels that are hard to walk in. She ready. Kerby’s boots win. Last year’s winner and this year’s winner! Met my girl crush.

 We all know that Bella Hadid is a die-hard revivalist. Whether it’s itty-bitty shoulder bags, or The Matrix-style sunglasses (or, indeed, both at the same time), her ability to breathe new life into overlooked trends from decades past has made her a style superstar off the runway as much as on. Now, it seems she’s set her sights on a new divisive accessory to bring back from the murkier corners of ’90s style: the fuzzy bucket hat. While the humble bucket has been enjoying a renaissance for quite some time now—just take the vintage-inspired Pocono nylon style flying off the shelves at Prada, or the more elevated take on the trend designed by Stephen Jones for Dior that comes with a spray of netting—its fluffier cousin has been yet to make its return. Arriving to London’s Heathrow Airport this afternoon, Hadid put her spin on the bucket hat (hers came in brown with a leopard faux fur trim), topping off an all-black look that included an oversize leather jacket, skinny jeans, and a stomping pair of Prada Monolith boots. It wasn’t the only throwback It accessory Hadid was sporting, either; slung over her shoulder was a highly covetable, graffiti-print messenger bag from Karl Lagerfeld’s iconic Spring 2015 collection for Chanel, known to fetch thousands on resale sites. But back to the hat: if now isn’t the time to embrace this snug, cozy style, then when? As fall turns to winter, there’s nothing more cheerful (or more luxurious) than having your head swaddled in a cloud of faux fur. So keep your eyes peeled—if Hadid’s track record is anything to go by, they’ll be on the head of every street style star once the colder temperatures begin to roll in.

 With fashion collaborations now a dime a dozen, it’s rare to find one that feels genuinely surprising. In a sea of influencer capsules and glorified marketing stunts, & Other Stories’s new link-up with Giorgia Lupi certainly qualifies—and if her name doesn’t ring a bell, your friends in tech definitely know her. As an information designer, Lupi is known around the world for her singular, artful approach to data: Instead of relying on hollow charts and graphs, she creates beautiful hand-drawn prints that lend a “human” touch to sterile numbers and statistics. (Her TED Talk about the concept has over 1.2 million views.) Lupi’s work is so striking, in fact, that dozens of her sketches are displayed at the Museum of Modern Art here in New York. “As human beings, we have no use for seeing raw data in an Excel sheet, because we can’t detect the patterns,” Lupi tells Vogue. “It’s only through design and visualization that we can access that knowledge, which is why I’m really passionate about this.” With her & Other Stories collection, Lupi is joining an interesting roster of past collaborators, including Rodarte’s Kate and Laura Mulleavy, Kim Gordon, and Lykke Li. Anna Nyrén, the brand’s head of “co-labs,” says her team was inspired by Lupi’s ability to tell stories with data: “With Giorgia, we talked about this concept of making data wearable, which is very new for us,” Nyrén says. “What we do is so tangible, so we had to figure out how to integrate this topic [of data] in a way that’s relevant and inspiring for our customers, and merge these two worlds that at first seem very different.” The result is a collection of knits, sheer dresses, blouses, puffer coats, and more bearing prints and embroideries Lupi designed using data collected from the lives of three women in science: Ada Lovelace, who wrote the first computer program in the mid-1800s; Rachel Carson, who started the environmentalist movement with her 1962 book Silent Spring; and Mae Jemison, the first African American woman to travel to space in 1992. “They were pioneers in fields that were historically male-dominated,” Lupi says. “But I wanted to focus on their significant accomplishments, not necessarily just on their lives as women. Sometimes it’s easier to focus on the obstacles they overcame, but to be really aspirational, I think it’s important to look at the contributions they brought to the world.” For Lovelace’s print, Lupi collected data from her life and groundbreaking algorithm, which went on to become the basis of every computer. Each passage of Lovelace’s algorithm is represented as a series of dashes, while her biographical data is symbolized by different colors. The print you see on the puffed-sleeve shirtdress looks appropriately tech-y, almost like a motherboard, but when you look closer, the human hand is abundantly clear. The print Lupi designed for Carson feels more organic, with nods to nature and flowers. Inspired by Silent Spring, Lupi pulled data from the contents of the book—the 17 chapters, the number of words and characters, the types of punctuation marks—as well as the different species Carson wrote about and her research on man-made climate change. Petal-like shapes indicated a single chapter of the book; touches of color represented Carson’s most-used words and terms; and live events, like Carson’s travels and published works, became little colorful dots and dashes. The final print resembles little sunbursts, appearing on ethereal dresses as well as simple base layers. The final print for Jemison appears the most straightforward at first glance: Its large circles evoke planets, and Lupi devised them to represent Jemison’s orbits around the earth, with smaller circles and lines symbolizing the number of days she spent in space. All of that said, attempting to explain Lupi’s process in words isn’t really the point. The significance of her work is that it tells a story with arresting visuals, not with words or numbers. Every item in her & Other Stories collection will come with a legend on the clothing tag, where Lupi has denoted the meaning of each line, shape, or color. “I make a great effort to craft legends that everyone can interpret,” she says. That reflects one of her most important philosophies: that most of the data we see is either too simplistic or too biased, which leads to misinterpretations. “We should all embrace the fact that data is never objective. It’s never a perfect representation of reality,” she insists. “It’s one representation, and the context of the data is rarely taken into consideration. If you think about the election, we saw these internet polls telling us one candidate would have 85% [of votes], and because it was presented with numbers, we believed it. We thought that represented America, and it didn’t.” (In her TED Talk, Lupi compared Trump’s 2016 victory to Italy’s 1994 election of Silvio Berlusconi, who also hadn’t been expected to win. Despite the 22-year difference and major advancements in technology, she says “technology failed us, and pretty spectacularly” both times.) “Even if you’d had access to all of the statistical models and numbers [behind the predictions], that data doesn’t speak the human language,” she continues. “So the more we can design visual languages, the more we can speak to the general public about it. I mean, I could go on for hours.” It’s a philosophy that applies to virtually every field, whether you work in politics, technology, science, or the media. In our fast-paced and tech-reliant world, it’s tempting to look for answers in “objective” statistics and numbers, but it’s unwise to assume they’re impartial just because they came from a computer. “I think what gets overlooked is that data doesn’t just exist—it’s primarily human-made,” Lupi says. “Human beings are recording reality, and we’re deciding what [information] to collect and what to leave out. I love working with data, but I don’t think it’s the answer to our questions or will solve all of our problems. I see it in a different way.” If that resonates with you, Lupi’s collection will be available starting tomorrow in & Other Stories stores and online (and if you’re really inspired, watch the TED Talk or stop by MoMA).

 Today, Kristen Stewart is out and about in New York City making the promo rounds for her new film, Charlie’s Angels—and while the actress is well-known for her love of a good suit, it seems her current style agenda is to subvert the buttoned-up look more than ever. The winning tailoring streak began this morning when Stewart arrived at a Good Morning America taping wearing a gray pantsuit by Acne Studios, complete with a cropped blazer and high-waisted trousers. The reworked silhouette was interesting enough, but she took it to the next level by forgoing a top in favor of a bra, as well as mounds of necklaces. (Imagine wearing that to a boardroom meeting.) Finally, she added classic pumps and wayfarer sunglasses for a sleek finish. Her sexy take on 9-to-5 dressing didn’t end there. After her taping, Stewart hit the streets in an entirely new suit getup: a timeless blue tweed Chanel skirt suit, complete with large cargo pockets. The jacket-skirt combo was youthful and fresh all on its own, but the actress leaned into the spunky vibe even harder with a cropped tank top styled underneath, as well as hefty combat boots instead of a heel. Call these two winning ensembles corporate girl gone wild—somebody alert HR! The latest fashion news, beauty coverage, celebrity style, fashion week updates, culture reviews, and videos on Vogue.com.

 When it comes to airport style, a pair of Vogue-editor-approved sweatpants are a foolproof alternative to the more carefully considered looks spotted on celebrities—whether that’s a crop top ensemble from Bella Hadid, or Rihanna’s ability to wear stilettos while taking an overnight flight. But there’s still the question of what to wear when you actually have to look semi-decent. Whether you’re traveling with a colleague on a business trip or vacationing with a significant other for the very first time, how do you put together a comfortable yet stylish outfit? The answer is simple: Channel your inner supermodel. From the tweed skirt suits and sensible flats of Suzy Parker in the ’50s that will take you from the airport straight into a board meeting, to the effortless white denim of Jean Shrimpton and cozy sweater dresses of Jane Birkin in the ’60s, we’ve rounded up the chicest travel outfits from every decade. The key to dressing like a supermodel while traveling? Stick to the basics. You’ll need a cool pair of shades in case of a run-in with the paparazzi, of course, but a great pair of jeans are also an excellent start—and looking back across the decades, the options are endless. In the ’70s, Iman opted for a classic light-wash blue jean paired with dark aviators, while in the ’00s, Natalia Vodianova opted for a pair of low-slung dark skinnies. Some trends have also made an impressive comeback: Just take Cindy Crawford’s signature ’90s mom jeans, which her daughter Kaia Gerber regularly gravitates toward almost 30 years later. Whatever decade you want to channel during your holiday travels, here are 12 ways to look chic in supermodel-approved, stylish and—most important—comfortable airport outfits. ’50s: Suzy Parker ’60s: Jean Shrimpton Jane Birkin ’70s: Lauren Hutton Iman and David Bowie ’80s: Cindy Crawford ’90s: Kate Moss Naomi Campbell ’00s: Natalia Vodianova ’10s: Paloma Elsesser Kaia Gerber The latest fashion news, beauty coverage, celebrity style, fashion week updates, culture reviews, and videos on Vogue.com.

 It seems that Kendall Jenner still can’t get enough of the ’90s. The model, who turned 24 this past weekend, has long been wearing maximalist archive looks from the decade—whether that’s the skimpy Versace dress she was spotted in this September, or the zebra print halter top (also Versace) that same month. But yesterday, she translated her love for the era into a more minimalist look. While shopping at Tiffany & Co. on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, she stepped out sans bra in a mini, body-skimming brown dress by Zeynep Arcay. Jenner accessorized the slinky spaghetti strap number with a glinting necklace, sparkling earrings, square-toe mahogany croc kitten heel mules by A.W.A.K.E—and, of course, two mini Tiffany shopping bags in their signature robin’s-egg blue. For the keen Sex and the City fan, Jenner’s barely-there number had another significance: The look felt like a subtle throwback to Carrie Bradshaw’s iconic DKNY “naked dress” from one of the series’ very first episodes, “The Secret Sex,” filmed in 1998. (In the episode, Bradshaw famously wore it in a shoot for an advertisement that appeared on the sides of New York busses, and was then debating whether to wear it out in public.) At the time, the style was considered risqué and more like a bedroom slip. As for Jenner’s incarnation? She opted for a more modern take, veering closer to clingy shapewear territory. (Jenner’s sister, Kim Kardashian West has been pushing her own shapewear label Skims for several months now, churning out flesh-toned pieces that can be worn under clothes, or even as clothes themselves.) But whether you consider it a classic slip dress or shapewear, Jenner’s look suggested that the nude-effect dress will always be traffic-stopping—even 20 years after Bradshaw’s version first crossed our screens.

 Phoebe Waller-Bridge—the creator and star of Fleabag and Vogue’s December cover star—has cultivated a red-carpet look that’s all her own. Though she’s only been on the Hollywood circuit for a few years, she has managed to create a signature aesthetic on the step-and-repeat that’s always cohesive no matter the occasion. Her track record has proven that she loves clean, refined designs that have just enough wow factor—whether it’s a suit or a gown. Her look is pared-back dressing at its finest—simple but never boring. Take some of her most recent ensembles. Who could forget the frothy Monique Lhuillier gown that she wore to this year’s Emmy Awards, where Fleabag swept the evening and won the coveted award for best comedy series? Then there was the red-hot sequin-covered Galvan number that she wore to the 2019 Golden Globes. Waller-Bridge, who works with stylist Elizabeth Saltzman, often finds gowns that strike the balance of being visually interesting without being over-the-top—not an easy feat in an arena where designers send their most extravagant gowns to stars for their consideration. Waller-Bridge also has a thing for suiting up. She especially loves a bold, colorful two-piece. In August, for instance, Waller-Bridge sported a green velvet suit by Victoria Beckham. She also walked the pink carpet at the Cannes International Series Festival last year wearing a Hellessy double-breasted style in pastel pink. Below, more of Waller-Bridge’s best red-carpet looks.

 Berlin-based DJ and producer Honey Dijon straddles the worlds of fashion and music—she’s just as comfortable spinning at New York Fashion Week after-parties as she is at some of the world’s finest clubs. But with her newly launched Comme des Garçons line—cheekily titled Honey Fucking Dijon (or HFD for short)—she’s getting entangled in the fashion marketplace like never before. The HFD collection includes everything from T-shirts emblazoned with the streamlined HFD logo to headphone and USB-stick carriers to leather record bags for DJs. All of the HFD products were artfully arranged by Andrew Taylor-Parr up at Dover Street Market’s New York City store this past Saturday night. Dijon hosted HFD’s East Coast launch party (she also hosted an unveiling of the line at the Los Angeles Dover Street Market in mid-October). In an all-out festive spirit, Dijon wore a sparkling Comme number to the event: a CDG Homme Plus velvet coat (with coattails!) embroidered all over in sequins. Dijon cut her teeth as a DJ in New York in the ’90s. Familiar faces from those early club days came to celebrate, including Masters at Work’s Louie Vega and his wife, vocalist and DJ Anané Vega. Some of Dijon’s newer acquaintances made appearances as well, like NYC-based photographer Richie Shazam Khan. She also reconnected with former collaborators like nightlife impresario Ladyfag. It was a New York City homecoming of sorts for the DJ and newly anointed fashion designer, one where her peers could go home wearing their allegiance to Honey Fucking Dijon on their sleeve. Stopped by my friend Andreas Anastasis to get my hair cut and styled before the event. He is a master with bangs. One of the HFD tees available at Dover Street Markets worldwide! The Honey Fucking Dijon installation designed by Andrew Taylor-Parr, who has also designed the installations in London and Los Angeles! The designer Walt Cassidy and me. I am super excited for the release of his upcoming book, New York: Club Kids, which is releasing November 26. Singer Skunk Anansie, Ladyfag, and me catching up. We have worked together for many years, and she is like a sister to me. Cakes da Killa and me during his amazing performance! A polaroid of Cakes da Killa. A polaroid of Walt Cassidy. A polaroid of Eric Johnson—some of my longtime NYC friends showed up to celebrate the launch! Louie Vega, Anané Vega, and their son Nico. My good friend Quentin Harris DJ’d the party. A polaroid of Richie Shazam Khan. A polaroid of Skunk Anansie. A polaroid of Youssef Bouabid. A polaroid of Viva Ruiz. Dressed in my Comme des Garçons Homme Plus velvet sequin coat with tails and full of excitement.

 What makes a shirt a shirt and a jacket a jacket? Perhaps there is a technical definition dividing the two, but from a style perspective it really comes down to position: Shirts go under, jackets go over. But what about the shirt jacket? This hybrid is an ideal wardrobe component that makes dressing for erratic temperatures during tricky transitional weather easier than ever. The shirt jacket’s versatility is unmatched. Wear it alone as a top or with some light layers underneath as a jacket—and come winter you can even fit one under a bulky coat. What’s more, the piece has street style’s stamp of approval. Here, five street-style stars are seen wearing denim, leather, and wool-flannel versions, as well as wrapped utility styles. They’re structured like jackets yet comfortable like a shirt or blouse. They’re fitted enough so you can tuck them into trousers, loose enough to layer with, and warm enough to wear alone. Plus they offer a more casual take than a formal blazer when worn with a skirt or trouser but can be thrown together with just as many outfits as a suit jacket could. Layer a wrapped style over a midiskirt for an ultrachic take on fall office dressing, or tuck a button-front leather or plaid version into jeans for easy weekend style. Stylish versatility is perhaps where the secret to nailing the street-style look lies this fall. Shop 11 of our shirt-jacket picks below.

 This year’s retail apocalypse has made store closings a regular part of the news cycle, but the industry’s struggles are resulting in outside-the-box ideas. As brands have sought new ways to keep their audiences engaged, they’ve become increasingly collaborative, joining forces with international peers for capsules or exclusive products. The latest of these alliances is Los Angeles mainstay Fred Segal’s newly announced pop-up with the Japanese department store Beams, launching November 14 at Fred Segal’s Sunset Boulevard flagship. Known for its limited-edition partnerships with brands like Woolrich and New Balance, Beams is currently experiencing a crossover moment. Beams’s willingness to pair up with other brands mirrors Fred Segal’s strategy of in-store guest appearances from like-minded shops. After debuting a successful micro-version of London boutique Browns last year, Beams continues the tradition. Popular destinations for luxury shoppers traveling abroad, both stores come with a built-in fan base and a carefully curated selection. “There’s a deeply connected community around these iconic retailers,” says John Frierson, Fred Segal’s president. “By sharing, we’re inspiring creativity and excitement for all of us. There’s great brand synergy between Beams and Fred Segal.” Ironically, when Beams was founded in 1976, it looked to Western culture for its inspiration point. Its tagline, “American Life Shop Beams,” sought to emulate the sunny So-Cal collegiate experience during a period in Japan when levity was sorely needed. “The tides had turned after a gloomy era of depression and political turbulence and the youth, influenced by images of American culture that they saw in movies and on TV, were hungry to get their hands on something other than army surplus,” says Yo Shitara, Beams’s president. “A small group of young men traveled to California and returned with bags full of American fashion and home decor to sell—this was the beginning.” Fred Segal’s quirky take on luxury served as a significant influence, and the brands would eventually become collaborators starting in 2011, when Segal became the first to stock Beams’s in-house label and projects like the Beams Couture x Ziploc collaboration, an upcycled capsule of transparent accessories. Beams may not be a household name in the states, but its admirers are legion. Its multiple shopping concepts—the stores stock everything from home goods to records—cater to a variety of interests, but it’s Beams Plus, its innovative menswear label that has truly become a global phenomenon. Inspired by vintage workwear, the line has boosted the brand’s profile, as have frequent capsule collaborations with everyone from Crocs to Starbucks. “We have a niche but passionate following in America, probably because we have done many collaborations with American brands throughout our history, although very little of our products are available outside of Japan,” says Shitara. “Beams has been welcomed not only by international travelers, but equally so by the younger Japanese audience, who like what they see through our lens. We are curious to see how Los Angeles reacts to our curation of modern Japan.” The audience reaction may be the final test, but for Jeff Lotman, Fred Segal’s owner and chairman, there is a great deal American retailers can learn from their Japanese counterparts. Namely, how to merge merchandising and message. “American retailers separate product merchandising from marketing, and the results are just generally not authentic,” he says. “The marketing looks like marketing, which no one wants. At Beams, they’re unwavering in their design approach. So their storytelling is born out of authentic design concepts, and it’s much stronger.” That synergy may have something to do with the way customers interact with the store itself. While online shopping has become increasingly important in Japan, in the luxury sector, it has yet to reach the omnipresence it has in other countries. “[Our] customer surveys showed that a majority of shoppers at Beams come in contact with our sales staff before making a purchase,” says Shitara. “They are still more traditional in the way they shop, seeking input that guides their choice.” Face-to-face interaction and an ever-changing cycle of products you can’t get elsewhere aren’t new concepts, but they do have proven success rates. The wealth of pop-ups geared toward the holiday season and the dominance of exclusivity-centric streetwear brands like Kith and Supreme underscore the desire for one-of-a-kind experiences and unique merchandise. For his part, Shitara is sure customers will get a taste of the Beams experience without having to hop on a 12-hour flight. “[This] is our way of celebrating what we love about our country, both old and new, mainstream and subculture,” he says. “We invite you to a curated world of fashion, home, and gifts straight out of our flagship in Tokyo, where we hope you will find a piece of Japan to take with you.” The latest fashion news, beauty coverage, celebrity style, fashion week updates, culture reviews, and videos on Vogue.com.

 Happy birthday, Kris Jenner! The business mogul and momager to the Kardashians turns 64 today. To mark the big day, daughter Kim Kardashian West took to Instagram to celebrate Jenner with a special message—“You are the best mom in the entire world,” she wrote—and a new photo series that showcases a matching mother-daughter fashion moment. The photos show the duo sitting on a couch, both dressed in white tops, black pants, and similar Fendi boots. Kardashian West's pair were thigh-high and monogrammed while Jenner chose a more discreet, western-inspired plaid style. Jenner did opt for a bit of logomania in a different way, however: her leather purse had a monogrammed Fendi strap that mimicked her daughter's shoes. (Kardashian West is seen with the same purse, too.) Kim’s heartfelt birthday message thanked her mom for caring for their large family. “I don’t know how you do it!” she wrote. “Seriously my love and respect for you grows every single day seeing how you manage to take care of 6 kids, a million grand kids and make everyone feel so loved and special. You’ve given us the tools to be the best we can be and have taught us that kindness rules the world!” Clearly, Jenner has taught Kardashian West a thing or two about fashion as well, given their shared commitment to wearing head-to-toe designer clothing.

 Keanu Reeves, Hollywood’s most beloved nice-guy actor with the perfect amount of scruff, stepped out this past weekend at the Gucci-hosted LACMA Art + Film event in Los Angeles, holding hands with his girlfriend, artist Alexandra Grant. The actor went the classic route in an impeccably tailored gray three-piece suit but added a modern wildcard thanks to a pair of brown suede hiking-style boots. As for Grant, her ensemble was equally statement-making. The silver-haired Los Angeles-based artist wore a navy blue dress with diving décolletage. It was embellished with three bands of gems across the bust that made for a stunning Grecian effect. While the Internet may be buzzing about this specific Reeves and Grant moment, this is far from the first time that the two have been seen together. (They collaborated in 2011 and in 2016 on the picture books Ode to Happiness and Shadows.) In their public appearances, the pair have historically shared an understated and elegant sense of style. For example, for the Museum Of Contemporary Art Benefit in May, Reeves wore a suit and tie along with the same hiking boots from the LACMA event. (He’s an outfit repeater, too!) Grant opted for a refined full-sequined dress. Back in July at the Saint Laurent Spring 2020 show, Reeves and Grant were polished when they both wore all black. Reeves went for a simple blazer and jeans and Grant sported a short black sleeveless dress with a sequined bomber and over-the-knee-boots. Grant, who is an accomplished artist specializing in painting and sculpting, seems to have a grounded wardrobe. Her footwear choices are relaxed: Whether she is on her personal Instagram posing next to a painting or on the red carpet, she typically wears flats or low-heeled shoes. And more often than not, during her downtime, she’s in jeans and a T-shirt, which is not too far from Reeves’s own laidback style. Considering that many couples do indeed mimic each other’s style, it makes perfect sense that Reeves and Grant have paired up quite chicly in their own easygoing way. Keep your eye out for more appearances from this stealthy couple. The latest fashion news, beauty coverage, celebrity style, fashion week updates, culture reviews, and videos on Vogue.com.

 2019 has been the year of men in heels. Stars such as Harry Styles, Shia LaBeouf, and designer Marc Jacobs—who loves a hefty Rick Owens platform!—have stepped out in shoes with added lift, proving the style is no longer just for women. It’s only natural, then, that a fashion risk-taker such as Lil Nas X would hop onto the daring trend, too. Last night at the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund Awards in New York City, the rapper gave his sleek suit a boost with this surprising footwear choice. For the fashion-filled evening, the “Old Town Road” artist wore a white suit from Off-White’s Spring 2020 menswear collection that had black spray paint all over it. To give the graphic two-piece even more punch, he then added a stark white boot with a thick block heel by United Nude, a square-toe design made in collaboration with model Shaun Ross. Tons of jewels by Lillian Shalom and tiny little sunglasses added even more cool factor to the look—though his eye-catching heels totally stole the show. Marc Jacobs Takes the Hiking Shoe to Death-Defying Extremes Michelle Obama Just Scored Her First Grammy Nomination Shia LaBeouf Continues His Winning Streak of Statement Shoes Kim Kardashian West Does Futuristic Bodycon in Custom Rick Owens Harry Styles Puts a Rockstar Spin on the Grandpa Sweater Vest Harry Styles’s Saturday Night Live Appearance Was a Fashion Tour de Force The latest fashion news, beauty coverage, celebrity style, fashion week updates, culture reviews, and videos on Vogue.com.

 You arrive in London on an afternoon in late October as a million people are gathering at Parliament, in Trafalgar Square, in every corner of this great city, to protest Brexit. You are here for Cartier’s celebration of its two glamorous London outposts, and despite the sheer craziness of the current political situation, there will, you suppose, always be in England—and there may always be a Cartier presence in Mayfair, with the flagship on New Bond Street first setting up shop in 1909 as well as the newly renovated boutique just down the road on Old Bond. You spend the weekend antiquing—is the fact that a toy bear-on-wheels on Portobello Road requires his own suitcase really a reason not to buy him?—and on Monday, bright and early, you join the Cartier team at the New Bond Street address to hear one of several panels the company has assembled to honor its long history in Britain. (Cartier may be resolutely Gallic, but it has deep roots in this town: More than a century ago, Edward, Prince of Wales, who was a regular shopper at Cartier in Paris, declared that the maison was “the jeweler of kings and the king of jewelers.”) In his opening remarks, Pierre Rainero (whose fancy title is, image, style and heritage director of Cartier International) tells us that in the very salon where we are now seated, Charles de Gaulle hung out and worked on his speeches, with the legendary army officer even asking Cartier to design medals for heroes of the French resistance. (Why have I never seen one of these badges on a flea market table?) Next comes a discussion between the legendary Twiggy, who you have worshipped forever (oh, to be a stick-thin teenage model in the ’60s, with a pixie haircut and giant eyes) and Mary McCartney; Paul and Linda’s daughter and, like her mum, a photographer. Revelations from the talk: Twiggy, who loves to sew, made a little white outfit decorated with ladybugs for Mary when she was born, but there are no photographs of baby Mary wearing this garment, since this was long before cell phone cameras. And guess what? Mary, child of a Beatle, swears she actually takes the tube, and says she loves the new escalators that have replaced the old clattering ones. The affection between the two and their love of London is real, and puts you in a sunny mood as you tour the maison, where you fall in love with an incredible Art Deco bracelet composed of a cool 24 carats of undulating diamonds that converts into a bandeau—so practical! It screams “Mitford sister at a debutante ball,” and how divine would it look atop your carrot-colored bob? After lunch, there is a visit to the Old Bond Street boutique, where a special monogramming service is being launched, and archival objects with initials are on display, including a splendid gold cigarette case emblazoned with a diamond C that the Duke of Westminster gave to Coco Chanel in 1924. (He dumped her; she never got over it.) Time to get dressed up for the gala dinner at Chiltern Firehouse! The genius London milliner Stephen Jones is in the house; Carey Mulligan is also supposedly here, carrying a navy crocodile Guirlande handbag, but you never see her. At dinner, you are seated next to the adorable British fashion designer Roksanda Ilincic, and the two of you play with the spectacular Cartier bracelet she is wearing for the occasion. Suddenly a town crier in a Victorian costume rings a bell to announce that it’s time to go into the other room for the entertainment. With his booming voice, he reminds you of John Bercow, speaker of the House of Commons, who loves to bellow “ORDER!” over the warring factions in Parliament. The opening act is the young singer Grace Carter, who has a long braid, a feathery dress, and is very winning. She is followed by Rita Ora, who is wearing a hat that might have been donned by a chic Minnie Pearl. You plop yourself down on a sofa next to an ice cream wagon and watch the passing scene, but after a little while you can’t resist the lure of tea in bed at your hotel room in Claridge’s. Another day, another panel! This morning the designer Grace Wales Bonner and the model-activist Alek Wek share their London memories. Bonner tells the audience that she likes nothing better than holing up in libraries doing research; Wek describes what it was like to come to London as a 14-year-old refugee from South Sudan: “I had freedom, but it was freezing cold.” Then she says something that sums up the lure of this great city, even in these fractious times: “The world is colorful! We should be colorful.” Suddenly, before you can say “Irish backstop,” your Cartier dream is over. The carriage hired to take you to Heathrow will soon turn back into a pumpkin, and eight hours later you will be back in New York, struggling to get a giant bear off the airport conveyor belt, and wishing he had somehow turned, Cinderella-style, into a diamond bandeau.

 Produced by Vogue with Neiman Marcus At Vogue, we know (perhaps too well) the joy of the shopping spree. But, as the fashionable cast of “The Tourist,” is about to find out, there’s something extra enviable about an away-from-home splurge. As the four New York City visitors plan their itinerary from their hotel suite (room service, please!), their impeccable style is on full display. Whether it’s Frame’s striped faux fur jacket, a shimmery gold and black leopard-print mini from Aidan Mattox or seductive staples like Alice + Olivia’s forest green wrap dress, Theory’s tailored sheath, or a flirty slipdress from Rag & Bone, the ladies may well be the best dressed tourists ever to grace the streets of Manhattan. Of course, getting out of your daily bubble opens you up not only to new experiences, but new styles, and Neiman Marcus’ elegant floors are fully stocked with the latest looks—why not take a risk? From their designer shoe department (featuring Sophia Webster, Gianvito Rossi, Aquazurra and more), to envelope-pushing runway looks—as well as thoughtfully curated home and jewelry departments—one could well spend a day happily exploring Neiman Marcus’s myriad offerings. So, when our lively cast of characters descends upon New York City for a girls’ weekend, it’s inevitable that they’ll end up at Neiman Marcus’ new Hudson Yards flagship. The location not only promises an unparalleled shopping experience, but bespoke services and designer events. Whether it’s blowouts, browshaping, manicures, and nail art at BLVD, or custom embroidery, patchwork, and embellishments at Atelier Notify, the traditional act of shopping is transformed into a customizable next-level luxury experience. And Hudson Yards dining options are destinations in their own right. From The Zodiac Room’s decadent Mandarin Orange Soufflé and caviar tastings to Bar Stanley’s venerable Lobster Club and meticulously crafted cocktails (so welcome after a day of try-ons), it’s clear just how much the concept of “shopping” has evolved at Neiman Marcus.

 Davide Sorrenti, the New York photographer who died in 1997, at age 20, was, says his friend Lola Schnabel, “living in truth.” Now his mother, photographer Francesca Sorrenti, with London’s Idea Books, is publishing Davide Sorrenti ArgueSKE 1994 – 1997, a retrospective of her son’s work that more than supports Schnabel’s claim. (SKE stands for See Know Evil, the moniker that Sorrenti and his gang of friends and cohorts adopted, while Argue was his graffiti tag.) Naturalistic, authentic, and compelling, the images of Frankie Rayder, Milla Jovovich, Carolyn Murphy, and his girlfriend Jaime King, whom he was shooting editorially for the likes of Interview and Detour magazines, reflect the ’90s New York Sorrenti was living in. It was a city still in the shadows of a decimating 1987 recession and pulsing with rap, grunge, and skateboarding—cultures he knew intimately. Sorrenti had his own shadows to deal with. He had a hereditary blood condition, thalassemia, and used heroin in the last year or so of his life. His death due to kidney failure was co-opted into the narrative around heroin chic, and fashion’s troubling flirtation with vacant-eyed models in less than salubrious settings, images which often referenced documentarians like Larry Clark or Nan Goldin. But as the conversation with Francesca Sorrenti that follows reveals, the truth of her gifted son’s life and work—he was the brother of photographers Mario and Vanina Sorrenti—was far more complex than that. And this book, as well as the 2018 documentary about Sorrenti, See Know Evil, reminds us that the best way to think about this young man is not what he left behind, but what he continues to give us. Francesca, firstly, thank you for taking the time to speak. I’m sure putting together this book was an enormously emotional experience. [The book is] bittersweet, that’s the best way to describe it: bittersweet. The documentary, the exhibition, and now the book...they are keeping him alive. Davide is eternally 20. He was 19 and a half when he passed, but it’s odd to say that, so I always say he was 20. Can you tell me a little about the process of putting it together? When I design a book, I always think [about] what the person reading it would like to see. In Davide’s case we are talking about memory, about photography, about a kid who projected his life through his images. If you see the documentary, you will see the book. While you were his mother, you were also enormously supportive and encouraging of his photography. You both started to take pictures only a few years apart. Davide and I...it was a mother-son relationship, but also a relationship to a child with a genetic illness. You tend to live through that child: God forbid he gets hurt, God forbid whatever. Out of my three children, he and I were most similar. He was a little harder [than me]...because he was ill. Kids, when they’re sick, they grow up saying, “Why me?” Maybe at this point it would be useful to hear a little about how he came to photography, because you are this very creative force, and you’ve raised kids who are just as creative. Can you give me some family history? My career was always about fashion. [The ’60s New York boutique] Paraphernalia, I worked there, with [now movie director] Joel Schumacher, but [laughs] I was a bit clubby, and I was always running off to [the legendary NYC hangout] Max’s [Kansas City]. I got married very young, left to go to Italy, opened two boutiques, then got robbed. My kids saw all this. I then worked for Fiorucci, so they grew up amidst beads and feathers and denim. After my marriage ended I moved to New York, started working as a stylist, and my three kids became child models; they were always part of this life. I became a fashion photographer in 1991, and my studio was buzzing with shoots, and my kids were always there. I thought Mario was going to become a painter—his father is an artist—and he got a scholarship to art, but wasn’t interested. Instead, Mario became a model and then a photographer. And what about Davide? What was he doing? Davide was a sponge; he absorbed from his whole family, he would work with me and Mario, and with his stepdad, who was a children’s photographer and who is now Mario’s business manager; he played a huge role for Davide, showing him how to use a camera, and the dark room. He never went out without a camera around his neck. He got a camera when he was 17. We gave him a Contax for Christmas, but we had tons of cameras around. Mario had lent him one; he has his own apartment, and Davide was always there, touching Mario’s stuff! He once saw a picture of him with a camera and Mario said, “That’s my Miyama!” Also, Glen [Luchford] was very close to Davide, encouraging him. I would take him out of the country on my shoots, and we all lived in my studio. When I was editing film, he would help me, and when he would shoot I would help him. He’d say to me, “Ma, come look at my shoot. What do you think?” How did he go from shooting for himself to shooting professionally? Richard [Pandiscio, the former creative director of Interview] invited me to dinner, and I took Davide along. Davide was talking to Richard in his homeboy lingo—he refused to have any normality; he would call me his shawty, and I would say, “Davide, I am your mother,” and he would laugh his funny laugh. He was looking at Richard’s books, and they got into a conversation about art and photography, and Richard was fascinated by him, because Davide was into everything—golf, Snoop Dogg, opera, skateboarding—he was all over the place, he just loved life. Later that night, Davide said to me, “Richard wants me to do a story about my high school prom,” which in the end never came about because Davide said his high school prom was wack. And then he met Ingrid [Sischy, editor of Interview], and she gave him a story, and that was his first job; it’s a compilation of four pictures in the book. He came home from doing that all excited, and then he got a bigger commission on skateboarding. He shot it in Union Square, and I went by and I was sort of mesmerized by him. He was so professional, and he shot just like me—he was fast and he knew what he wanted. I was so proud that he wanted to see the clothes first; that had rubbed off on him from me. How do you view his work now, given you edited the book? There are two sides to his work: images of his friends, and his fashion work. His ties to his friends, they were so entwined with each other. The only time I ever saw anyone that entwined was the Bowery Boys on television! They were so united. Davide was the one with the creativity; he pushed everyone. And his fashion pictures...they are so beautiful, so interesting. There’s not one picture out there [of his] that was a straight-up picture. They were always about emotion, and the styling came from that too. When he did a campaign with David Lipman, his first advertising campaign, all the clothes and jeans [arrived at the studio]. And Davide messed them up, and he said no one wears jeans that are stiff. We had a conversation once, and I said, “Davide, you should lighten that picture,” and he would say, “Ma, it’s a dream world, it’s melancholic, it’s my spirit.” Emotion comes up a lot in the recollections and impressions of his friends and collaborators who are in the book, that his work was so much a reflection of the life he lived. Davide lived emotion in his life because he lived pain. Now I can talk about that as I am dealing with my own physicality. I think to myself, Wow, Davide, no wonder you pushed boundaries. I can’t equate my pain with his, but that’s where the sensitivity came from. He was there for the underdog. And he was a juvenile delinquent, pushing the boundaries, always with that giggle of his. Davide was otherworldly. How did someone create such a movement? How did this one little kid create so much love for 20 years? You’ve always spoken fearlessly and honestly about his use of drugs, but, rightly, you’ve strongly refuted Davide being only about that. Davide was a wild child. He smoked a lot of weed to deal with the pain. He had the bones of an 80-year-old, but was never stoned on a shoot, ever. When he shot, he was always so exhausted afterwards. I remember going to see [the Larry Clark movie] Kids, and he and Jamie [King, the model and his girlfriend] were leaving as I arrived, and I asked how it was, and he said, “Ma, it was wack. It was too over the top.” He started using [heroin] towards the end. The first time he tried it, he ended up in hospital [in July 1996], and he came down with peritonitis. The second time he tried it, he ended up in hospital again [in October 1996]. He tried it four or five times. Davide didn’t die of a heroin overdose. Unfortunately, with a drug autopsy, it takes several months for the results. [With Davide’s condition] you need blood transfusions every two weeks, and what I didn’t know was that he hadn’t had one in a few months. We went on holiday to Mexico, horseback riding and bungee jumping, and he was so exhausted, he just fell asleep. Davide’s death became central to the narrative of the fashion industry and heroin chic. Can you talk to me about that? Heroin chic...that term didn’t precede Davide. I was at his funeral, and I said this is not cool, this is not chic. It was Ingrid Sischy who labeled [that moment in fashion imagery] heroin chic, it got coined in 1997 after Davide died. [Sischy used the phrase at Sorrenti’s wake, Edward Helmore wrote in a piece for the Guardian about the See Know Evil documentary, quoting her as saying, “This is heroin, this isn’t chic. This has got to stop, this heroin chic.”] If I had to say anything, I would say Davide ended heroin chic. By that point [after Davide’s death] the ball was rolling on drugs, and something needed to be done. I thought that if I talked about it enough he would stay alive, by me just being involved and being an advocate for drug awareness. Davide’s girlfriend Jaime [James] King is in some of the most tender and intimate pictures in the book. Are you still in touch with her? Jaime, I saw her a couple of months ago. We text. I love her. When they were together they were two peas in a pod. They loved being alone together. Together they argued, together they couldn’t be apart. They were each other’s first true love. How does it feel to have worked on this book with where you are now? Sometimes I have a problem with spirituality and things that are otherworldly. Why did his passing cause such a ruckus? Why was his picture on the cover of the New York Times? [Fashion journalist] Amy Spindler came over and arrived at my door to interview me, saying I’d never have answered the phone if she’d called. [Spindler was to write a piece several months after Sorrenti’s passing called “A Death Tarnishes Fashion’s ‘Heroin Look’”; it’s still available to read online here.] What made [Davide] so special? I don’t know. I look at the book and the documentary, and I can see that he was special. He looked different, the laugh, the way he talked. He would get upset really fast and then be the sweetest soul. He had stuffed animals in him room, and if anyone made fun of them his response was “fuck you.” He had a fearlessness because he was sick. At his funeral this overweight girl came up and told he me that he would always stand by her, and talk to her, while his friends would goof on her. That was his personality. There was only one person who said he didn’t like him, and that was Marky Mark. Designers came [to Davide’s funeral], the pizza men from across the street, the garbage men, the homeless dude he gave money to. You never thought this kid with the baggy jeans and the cap down low was so full of everything. I have never denied Davide’s presence. He is always there.

 On paper, the 10 finalists for this year’s CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund might not have much in common. How could the whimsy of Raffaella Hanley’s Lou Dallas collections relate to the 3D printing technology used by Abasi Rosborough? Stylist Alex Harrington made the connections during the CVFF’s fashion show at Cipriani tonight, using dancers to underline themes of movement, performance, and glamour in each collection. Things started off with last year’s CVFF winner Kerby Jean-Raymond of Pyer Moss introducing this season’s show. “I remember being in the audience waiting for the announcement to happen, uncertain if my name would be called,” Jean-Raymond told the crowd. “I also remember the fashion show because it was a reminder of the bond formed between my fellow finalists. I hope it does the same for you.” Within seconds a parade of ballroom dancers emerged, zhuzhed up in Christopher John Rogers’s over-the-top confections. Then models darted across the dining room in wedding looks by Danielle Frankel, followed by flappers pouring flutes of Perrier-Jouët champagne in Lou Dallas’s homespun frocks. After models stomped though in Tre by Natalie Ratabesi’s ’80s-inspired garb, a painted model came out with a live snake—yes, there were gasps—to introduce Collina Strada’s upcycled dresses. There were flamenco dancers for Alejandra Alonso Rojas, voguers for Barragán, hip-hop dancers for Private Policy, greasers for Reese Cooper, and performers from Stomp in Abasi Rosborough who brought down the house down. By the end of it all, when a confetti canon shot silver glitter across the room, it was hard to find anyone not smiling. The ones who had real cause to smile were Rogers, who won the grand prize, and the two runners-up, Danielle Hirsch of Danielle Frankel and Reese Cooper.

 Tonight, the fashion crowd gathered in New York City to attend the 2019 CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund Awards. Among the crowd was last year’s winner, designer Kerby Jean-Raymond, models Ashley Graham, Taylor Hill, and sisters Gigi and Bella Hadid. Bella in particular brought her style A-game to the night devoted to celebrating emerging fashion. On the red carpet, she pulled yet another rebellious style move, dressed in a vampy black catsuit. Fully covered yet completely body-clinging, the aforementioned catsuit was by Alexander Wang, a CVFF winner in 2008. She gave the sexy look some extra oomph with the help of a sparkly evening bag, pointy black boots, and some shining jewels. Her take on the risky catsuit? It just may be worth its very own accolade.

 Christopher John Rogers has won the 2019 CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund. As the winner of this year’s grand prize, Rogers will receive $400,000 and a year of mentorship from a CFDA member. The 25-year-old designer, who hails from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and is based in Brooklyn, has become well known for his voluminous eveningwear in shocking colors and glittering sequins. Among his fans are Michelle Obama, Lizzo, and Tracee Ellis Ross. “I am so grateful to my parents for giving up so much that allowed me to be here, to my team who, through all the full-time jobs and all the leaving early, allow us to make this collection, and thank you to the judges for seeing something in me,” Rogers said in his acceptance speech. The runner-up prizes of $150,000 each and a year of mentorship were awarded to Danielle Hirsch of Danielle Frankel and Reese Cooper. Hirsch is the CVFF’s first-ever bridalwear finalist, whose brand of cool-girl wedding dresses, suits, and accessories has made her a favorite among no-nonsense brides like Zoë Kravitz, who wore a net dress by Hirsch to her rehearsal dinner earlier this year. Cooper’s grungy streetwear is on the other end of the fashion spectrum, representing a bit of California nonchalance among this year’s candidates. All three winners received their prizes at Cipriani South Street from a trio of presenters: Ashley Graham, Paloma Elsesser, and Alton Mason. The three winners were culled from a class of finalists made up of Abdul Abasi and Greg Rosborough of Abasi Rosborough; Alejandra Alonso Rojas; Victor Barragán of Barragán; Hillary Taymour of Collina Strada; Raffaella Hanley of Lou Dallas; Siying Qu and Haoran Li of Private Policy; and Natalie Ratabesi of Tre by Natalie Ratabesi. This year’s judging panel was led by Vogue’s Anna Wintour and the CFDA’s Steven Kolb, and included Joseph Altuzarra, Vogue’s Chioma Nnadi and Mark Holgate, Eva Chen, Andrew Rosen, Jeffrey Kalinsky, Roopal Patel, Diane von Furstenberg, and Elsesser.

 It wasn’t so long ago that renting clothes was a highly divisive subject. On one hand, websites like Rent the Runway gave you the chance to wear a new dress every weekend, or maybe even every day, with little financial commitment or closet real estate—what could be better? Then again, by renting a dress, you’re effectively sharing it with dozens of strangers, and isn’t that, well, kind of gross? We’ll admit we weren’t sold on the concept at first, but it’s an understatement to say things have changed—and quickly. Even in the fast-moving fashion industry, interest around Rent the Runway and similar sites is nothing short of jaw-dropping. For many women, it’s completely altered the way they shop, dress, and think about fashion. At this point, everyone knows someone who uses RTR. Rent the Runway has grown into a $1 billion company for plenty of reasons—the variety, the ease, the technology, the affordability—but what stands out right now is the evolution of its assortment. What began as a destination for special occasion dresses has expanded to include denim, tailoring, knitwear, handbags, jewelry, and more, with a far greater range of labels. It’s drastically different from my experience with RTR’s Unlimited subscription in 2017 (at $159 per month, you have access to an unlimited number of items). Back then, my chief complaint was that there weren’t enough items I wanted to rent; aside from a few dresses and jackets by Proenza Schouler and Tory Burch, the high-end designer offering was limited. I wasn’t looking for a cocktail dress, nor was I interested in renting from contemporary labels. Fast-forward to today, though, and many of fashion’s buzziest names have been added to the roster: Khaite, Brock Collection, Monse, Coach 1941, Mansur Gavriel, Staud, and 3.1 Phillip Lim among them, with Pyer Moss and Rosie Assoulin arriving online soon. Sarah Tam, the chief merchant of Rent the Runway, credits some of the site’s “early adopters” like Derek Lam, Jason Wu, and Prabal Gurung for motivating other designers to eventually join RTR. “But our consumer is also becoming more fashion-conscious,” she says. “As she’s getting more curious about designers, we’ve been able to add people like Rosetta Getty, Pyer Moss, Rosie Assoulin, Cecilie Bahnsen…. She’s [aware of] those brands, but also comes to us for discovery.” It’s fair to assume that Instagram and digital fashion media have played a part in the RTR customer’s fashion education. If she sees a label she likes on Instagram—whether it’s through her Discover page or an editor, influencer, or celebrity she follows—she’s likely to check if RTR carries it. Tam adds that her team’s approach always starts with data and customer demand: “I think the biggest difference between Rent the Runway and other retailers is that we have millions of data points and 10 years of customer feedback,” she says. “It’s really allowed us to understand what our customer is looking for, and once we know that, we can go to market and find the most relevant and exciting designers [to meet that demand]. For instance, last fall we saw blazers had a huge uptick, so we added brands with great tailoring, like Khaite and Veronica Beard.” Similarly, the demand for great jeans—possibly to wear with those blazers, or one of the 2,000 tops on RTR—created space for labels like R13, Re/Done, Rag & Bone, and Citizens of Humanity. Denim is perhaps the best example of how varied the RTR offering has become; who knew that the same girl who rents cocktail and bridesmaid dresses would also want to rent her skinny jeans? Still, as we find ourselves entering holiday party season, it’s the in-between stuff that’s making us consider a subscription: Khaite’s dramatic emerald blouse; Rick Owens’s draped jersey column; Monse’s asymmetrical blouse and trousers; Adam Lippes’s festive cape; Derek Lam’s multi-printed skirt. They’re fashion-forward, unstuffy pieces you can dress up or down, which is ideal for the girl who doesn’t want to wear them just once, but a few times. Even better, Vogue readers can save $150 on a 90-day trial by signing up with the code RTRVOGUE.

 In the past, it might have been spotted mostly in corporate environments or as professional dancing shoes—but this season the T-strap pump (also known as the T-bar) has made a very stylish return. This more formal heel style has been enjoying a long-overdue revival during the past few months, just in time to become a top contender for those weighing up their choice of party shoes for the upcoming holiday season. The T-bar heel has received some major improvements along the way to make them more appropriate for today’s woman, whether that’s of-the-moment stamped, croc-effect leather or dainty chain ankle embellishments. The silhouette also has the approval of fashion powerhouses like Celine, Gucci, and Prada, along with backing from timeless heritage footwear brands like Manolo Blahnik and Jimmy Choo. So too have white-hot contemporary brands like By Far and Reike Nen been experimenting with putting a more everyday spin on the retro shape. Red leather kitten- or block-heel mary janes make for fancy footwear perfect for a Thanksgiving feast or even a first time meeting the parents; meanwhile classic black styles in glossy patents, chain-dusted satins, or cutout suedes are a chic option for any winter wedding guest. Deep red satins and velvets, decorative gold piping, and shiny metallic styles are the perfect shoes for any type of holiday gathering or Christmas party, while pearl- or crystal-encrusted dancing shoes will take you through until the clock strikes midnight on New Year’s Eve. For a fresh take on party heels and a jumpstart on festive dressing, consider the T-strap pump as the ultimate party shoes for the holiday season—and shop 15 dazzling pairs below.

 Rosalía’s interest in flamenco isn’t a passing fancy; in her youth, the Catalonian artist spent over a decade training in the centuries-old practice with a local teacher. Her wardrobe, too, often pulls from the traditional garments associated with the art form. Just take the baby blue set she wore onstage at Madcool Festival in Madrid this past summer: offering a pop princess twist on the traditional traje de flamenca, or flamenco dress, Rosalía performed in a ruffle-lined crop top with seafoam green hot pants. Last night, at the MTV European Music Awards in Seville, Spain—where the singer also won Best Collaboration with J Balvin and El Guincho for their song “Con Altura”—the singer-songwriter arrived at the red carpet in yet another reinterpretation of a classic flamenco sartorial motif. The polka dot is one of the most prominent designs featured on ruffled Andalusian flamenco dresses, but Rosalía gave the pattern a bold spin, wearing a black and white dotted Balmain suit, with an inversely printed crop top and matching flared pants underneath, to the ceremony. Only Rosalía could wear such a familiar pattern and still invoke centuries of Spanish history in one fell swoop. Rosalía’s Rainy Day Look Puts a Bright Twist on the Babushka Trend Dua Lipa Is Keeping the Harness Trend Alive For Frank Ocean’s Queer Club Night, Rosalía Subverted a Classic Fashion Logo Michelle Obama Just Scored Her First Grammy Nomination After 15 Years in Business, Phillip Lim Is Charting a New Path Toward Sustainability Kacey Musgraves Steps Out With French Girl Bangs and a Bombshell Ab Reveal The latest fashion news, beauty coverage, celebrity style, fashion week updates, culture reviews, and videos on Vogue.com.

 Imbued in the fiber of denim is a spirit of rebelliousness. Sure, the humble fabric started as workwear in Nimes, France, but thanks to its stronghold on 20th-century popular culture, it became synonymous with the bad-boy swagger of James Dean, Marlon Brando, and Bob Dylan. No wonder Renzo Rosso was quickly drawn to the material as a teenager in Italy. “Denim was the sign of a social movement based on courage and freedom. That caught my attention and made me want to feel part of it,” he tells Vogue. At 15 years old, he stitched up his first pair of jeans on his mother’s Singer sewing machine, intentionally going against the patterns and proportions he had learned at the Marconi Technical Institute. The final jeans were 42 inches long—compared to the classic 30- or 32-inch inseam—and featured a bulbous, flared silhouette and exposed zipper fly. Spiritually, they were the predecessor of everything Rosso has done since at Diesel, the company he cofounded with Adriano Goldschmied in 1978. That long history is celebrated in a new tome, 5D: Diesel, Dream, Disruption, Deviation, Denim, releasing this fall from Rizzoli. “I get emotional looking at the photos and thinking back on what we have done over the years. What makes me happiest is that the brand has kept its essence from the beginning,” Rosso says. He has cause to get a little misty-eyed: The 247 pages sandwiched between the hard covers of Rosso’s new tome cement his place in denim legend. Full-bleed images showcase Diesel’s vast offering of denim from the past four decades: Acid wash! Baggy! Super-slick skinny! Cropped! Flared! Overalls! While you could spot a pair of Diesel jeans from miles away thanks to the diagonal tag on the front pocket, Rosso’s crucial contribution to the world of denim is distressing. Started in the early ’90s, Diesel’s practice of whiskering around the thighs, fading along the seams, and scuffing up knees so as to imply a night of thrashing became the new standard for jeans in the years following. “Diesel changed the way the world views denim,” Rosso declares. Rosso created an entire world founded on provocation. His ad campaigns for Diesel transcend fashion, acting as pop cultural bellwethers for their era. The For Successful Living campaign of parody advertisements made waves when it was introduced in the ’90s and again during its aughts reissue. “We’ve changed the idea of advertising by making ads that advertise anything but our own products, such as tires or hairsprays,” says Rosso. “We called the campaign ‘For Successful Living,’ a parody of the promise of success and eternal happiness used to sell everything and everyone.” He didn’t end there. Other campaigns feature oil-slicked models posing beside desserts with the text “Stop dieting, stick to Diesel” or a smoky-eyed angel holding up the middle finger of her feathered wing. This brand of tongue-in-cheek confrontation hasn’t lessened since the arrival of social media either. Just last year Diesel launched an anti-bullying campaign starring Nicki Minaj—she of the infamous, “Miley, what’s good?” “One thing has remained consistent and inviolable since its inception: Diesel is as progressive, bold, and fueled by an uncompromising spirit in the design of its product, as it is in its marketing and communications outings,” Rosso says. But for all its posturing, Diesel also has a heart. Not only has it made strides toward sustainability this year by using recycled Coca-Cola bottles to produce new jeans and tees and collaborating with Japanese upcycling brand Readymade, it’s also been contributing to charities like Fashion for Relief. Through its Red Tag project, Diesel has also helped support young designers like Hood by Air’s Shayne Oliver and Y/Project’s Glenn Martens. So what should a reader take away at the end of almost 40 years and 300 pages of Diesel revving? “That Diesel is an attitude, and it always will be.” The latest fashion news, beauty coverage, celebrity style, fashion week updates, culture reviews, and videos on Vogue.com.

 Today, Katie Holmes attended the Tribeca Chanel Women’s Filmmaker Program Luncheon in New York City, a program that helps provide funding and mentorship to women writers and directors. For the event, the actress—who has been on a winning fashion streak lately—opted for a dressed-up take on her usual, more casual style that was perfect for the occasion—but it was her jeans, in particular, that were the freshest styling proposition for fall. Wearing head-to-toe Chanel, Holmes slipped on graphic jeans from the label’s Pre-Fall 2018 collection that drew the eye with their vertical striping; the wide-leg silhouette also happens to be one of the biggest denim trends of the season, as seen on stars from Margot Robbie to Harry Styles. She styled her statement jeans in an equally punchy way, wearing them with a bright red tweed jacket from Chanel’s latest Fall collection, complete with crystal buttons in the shape of flowers. Still, classic pieces helped ground the punchy look: such as a white tee, a classic quilted Chanel bag with a chain strap, and pointy white pumps. The takeaway? Classic jeans will never tire, sure—but consider putting down the basics in favor of a spunkier, more unexpected style this season.

 Every outfit tells a story—but especially so after Cher has worn it. No celebrity has had as many headline-making looks or groundbreaking fashion moments as the Hollywood legend, who even today continues to innovate. As a singer, actress, beauty entrepreneur, host, producer, and more, Cher has worn many hats over the years, and her style has evolved to match each career shift. As she heads toward another milestone—the revival of her fragrance line via the forthcoming launch of her new scent, Cher Eau de Couture—the icon sat down with Vogue to talk reinvention, on and off the red carpet. Armed with a portfolio of images featuring five decades worth of outfits, Cher was eager to look back. “I’m ready—I’m going to start answering questions without someone asking!” she shared, as she opened to a look from the ’60s she’d designed herself. With each turn of the page, the style became more ornate: From the epic Bob Mackie costumes of The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour to her arresting 1986 Academy Awards mohawk headdress and matching gown, there was little time left over for sneakers and sweats—and with good reason. “In this era I could hardly take a bad picture,” she says. “All my clothes were fabulous, and I loved them. I spent pretty much all of my time naked.” Though she has a wry sense of humor about herself and her famous fashions, Cher tells it like it is. As a star who delighted the world by defying trends (and alarmed the censors with her racier leather and lace pieces), she’s had no shortage of statement looks, but the logic behind each outfit may surprise you. We’ve all seen the pictures of her in the snakeskin boots she picked up at a vintage store on a whim, the dresses made from rare European fabrics favored by Marlene Dietrich, and the beloved jeans she’s patched and re-worn again and again, but nothing beats hearing about them from the woman herself. In this exclusive video, the goddess of pop guides Vogue through her fashion hits—and hints the best may be yet to come.

 It’s hard to overstate the sartorial impact of Sean “Diddy” Combs. The music legend, who turns 50 today, has led by example as a boundary-pushing style star, CFDA Award–winning designer, and one of the most vocal advocates of streetwear’s haute legitimacy. In 2019, the front rows are populated by Cardi, Kanye, and a host of clotheshorses from the world of rap. Still, their dominance in the sphere wouldn’t be possible if Diddy hadn’t stormed the gates 20 years earlier, introducing the establishment to the dominant sound of youth culture and a brash aesthetic, turning the concept of luxury on its head with an inclusive viewpoint and extroverted swagger. Naturally, this turning point was immortalized in Vogue: “Puffy Takes Paris,” Annie Leibovitz’s arresting October 1999 editorial, captured the star’s debut at the Fall 1999 couture shows at the height of the ’90s “bad boy” phenomenon. At once an exploration of the season’s strongest pieces, as worn by supermodel Kate Moss, and a document of a disruptor making his mark on the world stage, the editorial remains fresh more than 20 years later. Trends come and go, but the sight of Diddy and Kate resplendent on the rooftops of Paris or exiting a Bentley in coordinated furs still sizzles. Shot over the course of a week, the now-iconic editorial resulted in plenty of behind-the-scenes stories—and who better to tell them than the man himself? Tales of late-night parties and luxe looks are par for the course when it comes to ’90s fashion, but the real impact of the story lies in the era its star helped to usher in. Long before inclusion and diversity became industry-wide buzzwords, Combs’s Sean John runways were a showcase for both. His landmark Menswear Designer of the Year win at the 2004 CFDA Awards opened the door for a new generation of designers, most notably Public School’s Dao-Yi Chow and Maxwell Osborne, who began their careers at the brand. His Leibovitz editorial captures the beginning of that legacy, but don’t just take our word for it. Here, the producer, designer, and superstar unpacks his seismic impact across fashion—in the pages of Vogue, and beyond. On the editorial’s genesis. “I was automatically into the idea. I grew up looking at GQ and Vogue, and knowing who Anna Wintour was. The Sean John brand was something that I truly believed in, the power of clothes that I was making and that the designs were representing the street culture. I knew the level of seriousness I took as a designer. Usually, [street culture] was getting taken by some of the fashion houses, but it wasn’t coming from the creatives who put it on the map. Once I got that call from Anna, I was blown away. She was bringing me into her world and letting me disrupt it. And I was bringing my authenticity. [At the time] I was dressing out. I was designing my clothes and jewelry, and doing things that weren’t being done in fashion. This was during a time when there wasn’t a lot of blackness in fashion, or black models on the runways in magazines.” On his supermodel squad. “Kate [Moss] and Naomi [Campbell], we were friends already. We hung out the night before and barely made it to the shoot. This was the ripping, roaring, ’90s high fashion, and [during] fashion week, so it was just nonstop. [At shows], all the models were getting in from the night before. They just stopped partying, just stopped drinking, 15 minutes ago. Right in time for hair and makeup! But it was so comfortable because Kate and I knew each other. Kate was always somebody that blended in, who appreciated the hip-hop community and embraced it. She was one of our people, and when we were doing the shoot, it was like doing a shoot with a friend. But also, one of the sexiest women in the world.” On disrupting the front row’s status quo. “[Back then] there was no one in the front rows. We weren’t invited to anything, and if you were black and you were hip-hop, it was dangerous. I think going out there as a statesman and letting them know, ‘We cool; we’re artists too.’ We’re the same thing [as] jazz artists or rock-and-roll artists, or punk artists. We’re just a different type of artist, and I was able to see that and feel that energy.” On posing alongside Lagerfeld and Galliano. “I got in the middle of the picture because it had to be me! I just felt like it was artistic to have that disruption, but everybody treated me like a fellow designer. Nobody treated me like a hip-hop star or celebrity or anything like that when I was posing with the designers, and that gave me a level of confidence.” On the mood on the set. “The energy felt like Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner with Sidney Poitier. Just seeing Kate Moss with a black man on a bridge, and watching Scarface in a hotel room—the provocativeness of it. That was crazy and before its time. It showed what the future was going to be, how all the artists and the barriers between them would be broken down musically and fashion-wise. The inspiration of fashion [viewed] through hip-hop culture becoming mainstream globally on fashion’s biggest runways and in fashion’s biggest magazine. I understood that. I knew something big was going on; I wasn’t jaded. I’m not going to lie: I was like a schoolgirl. I was so happy to be involved. I was like, ‘There are no men in Vogue, [but] I’m in Vogue.’ I felt pretty.” On shining bright on the world stage. “We didn’t know it was going to go this far, to be honest. As far as Virgil [Abloh], Edward [Enninful]. We didn’t imagine Kanye [West] or Pharrell [Williams] at the time. I was standing on the shoulders of Russell Simmons and Willie, just trying to represent and get in the game. Coming from Harlem, your style is everything; you can’t compromise on your style. So, I didn’t compromise; I was going to be straight to the point. They would feel the confidence, and they would start shooting because I was in a light phase. I was shining real bright, my energy, and just the overall frequency and vibration. It was unapologetically black and unapologetically hip-hop in Vogue. That’s that.” On his fashionable legacy. “I think my legacy in fashion has already begun. It started when I put out the first Sean John velour suit, the first Sean John jeans and hats. The legacy was having the audacity to get on the plane and be alright with the ketchup tasting different! The ketchup tastes different overseas. That was a big reason why we wouldn’t really go over to Europe! I was the first African American to win the CFDA award, and then my senior designers, Dao-Yi Chow and Maxwell Osborne—the team that worked with me on Sean John—they were able to go and win one of their own. Then when it came down to what Supreme was doing, and how Virgil was able to go and take that opportunity and really fly and be brave and fearless. That’s just the way we were doing it; we really didn’t give a fuck if you liked it or not. If it wasn’t for you, it wasn’t for you. But you couldn’t front, it did make you feel cool. I would say that my legacy is for all black designers. Diversity is essential, but black designers have a hard time, and we’re the most fashionable people on planet earth. So [Sean John] gave birth to this moment; it empowered these young creatives to know that their talent and their ideas and their designs had value and that they had power. I see the trickle-down effect, and that was the intention, going with the goal of breaking down the doors for other people.” The latest fashion news, beauty coverage, celebrity style, fashion week updates, culture reviews, and videos on Vogue.com.

 Over the past year, Hollywood’s most daring men have been storming the red carpet in harnesses. The frisky, S&M-inspired trend was first ignited by Timothée Chalamet at the 2019 Golden Globes, where the actor wore a sequined style by Louis Vuitton (Virgil Abloh first showed them in the label’s Spring 2019 collection). Soon after, other risk-takers began buckling into the piece, including Travis Scott, Michael B. Jordan, and more. But just when you thought that the trend might fizzle out, Dua Lipa has gone ahead and brought it back, proving the look works just as well on women, too. Attending the 2019 MTV EMAs in Seville, Spain last night, the singer delivered a show-stopping performance of her new single, “Don’t Start Now,” in a cut-out Mugler bodysuit that was all about showing skin. But her red carpet moment before the awards was just as risqué: she wore a leather harness top, fastened over a long black dress. The pieces were from Dion Lee’s Spring 2020 collection, and offered a more elevated take on the harness movement, which men have been styling in a more flashy, streetwear-inspired way. (In her new music video for her latest single, Lipa also wore a strappy yellow Versace bra top; it seems the harness is playing a key part in the visuals for her new album.) She finished off the look with satin Jimmy Choo boots and thigh-high socks with garters—a sexy detail inspired by lingerie that added a final, appropriately kinky, touch.

 Kith’s annual runway show in September contained a little surprise for those closely paying attention: A ready-to-wear collaboration with Vogue and Russell Athletic. It’s the second time Vogue has teamed up with the brand, and the first that the range of products extends into varsity jackets, track pants, and crewneck sweatshirts. “We are huge Vogue fans over here at Kith,” founder Ronnie Fieg says. “Vogue has been on our mood board for such a long time that it made sense to do another collaboration.” The new collection, dropping in Kith stores and online this Friday, has been made in partnership with Kith’s Love Thy City project. That means each piece comes with a visual homage to the places that house Kith’s flagship stores: Brooklyn, Los Angeles, Miami, and Soho, New York. “I know that people will want to represent the city where they live,” Fieg begins. “Those major cities are influenced so much by fashion and so much by Vogue that I thought it would be a perfect tie-in to bring the cities into it, just to get a different spin on the product.” Each item bears the influence of the city it represents—no surprise the Miami sweatshirts are pastel and the Brooklyn jackets are black—with the entire collaboration evoking a certain collegiate spirit. That all-American, nostalgic take on Vogue is intentional, as Fieg tells it, harking back to the ’90s when both the magazine and Russell represented an idealized, aspirational vision of Americana. “My mom subscribed to Vogue in the ’90s, and even though she couldn’t afford what she was looking at, she was inspired and had great style. I know that Vogue was a great inspiration for her. The February 1994 issue, when the mag was $3, by the way—was a great one with Cindy Crawford on the cover,” Fieg says. The Vogue cover that left the most indelible mark on the designer—and that has the most aesthetically in common with the collaboration—is August 1993, which shows Crawford in a prim red cardigan, black pants, and high black boots. “How impactful is this?!” Fieg cheers. “Nothing is as impactful as this anymore. To me, it’s not even close. I feel like the Cindy covers are forever.” Kith x Russell Athletic x Vogue’s Love Thy City collection goes on sale at Kith stores and online on November 8 at 11 a.m.Subscribe to Vogue and get inspired.

 Glamour can take many forms, but last week the world’s most stylish looked to the cinematic goddesses of the Thirties (Lombard, Harlow, Crawford) for inspiration on how to achieve it with seemingly effortless grace. Very rarely does one see such aesthetic consensus, and such elegance, on the red carpet. Consider Gugu Mbatha-Raw’s vivid fuchsia Erdem with its starry embellishments and floor-grazing drama. Or, for the opening of the Tokyo Film Festival, a pregnant Zhang Ziyi in black velvet by Hedi Slimane for Celine with layers of Chopard diamonds; and Alicia Vikander in royal blue from Nicolas Ghesquière for Louis Vuitton. These dresses were graceful yet substantial, majestic yet understated. Much like their wearers, they possess real star quality. The vintage inspiration continued at LACMA’s Art + Film Gala, which was sponsored (and largely dressed) by Gucci. Two outstanding looks from Alessandro Michele: Yara Shahidi in a lamé gown with spiral pleats adorning the neckline, and Kiki Layne in a gown of jade sequins and a koi print. Layne paired her retro look with show-stopping sculptural braids, making clear that hers is a thoroughly modern beauty.

 Tyler, the Creator has always had strong fashion game. In addition to designing his very own streetwear line Golf Wang, the rapper has enviably cool personal style. He often mixes skater-inspired pieces with status designer items— think, a pink Chanel bag. Since the release of his new album Igor, however, the musician has been experimenting with radical new wardrobe ideas, including the distinctive blonde wig and colorful suiting he’s been wearing on tour. His latest turn on the red carpet signals yet another fashion mood: the English school boy. Tyler’s take on school uniform realness was seen just last night, at the 2019 LACMA Art and Film Gala in Los Angeles. He wore pieces from Gucci’s Pre-Fall collection including a mustard wool V-neck sweater, worn over a blue striped dress shirt and green silk tie, khaki shorts (with a khaki bucket hat to match), fisherman sandals, and calf-length tube socks. This studious vibe is one that Tyler, the Creator also sported in his new music video for “I Think,” which was released last week and features a cameo from friend Kendall Jenner. For a brief second in the clip, the rapper is seen wearing another V-neck sweater, page boy cap, shorts, and the same tube socks once again. On his Instagram, he’s also posted similar sock fits.  Which just goes to show that when it comes to fashion, this rapper is in a class of his own.

 Human rights lawyer Amal Clooney has cultivated a look that managed to toe the line between professional and fashion forward, polished and playful. She rarely does a traditional suit, rather gravitating towards pieces with personality that still convey a buttoned-up vibe. The end result is a modern take on office attire with individualistic flair. This weekend in New York City, Clooney was back at it again, this time proving that a good dress can mean business. She stepped out wearing a black and white floral-printed wrap dress that had quarter-length sleeves, a round neck, and a large gold button as a focal point. The look struck the right balance of simplicity with fun, stylish details. The accessories—leather top-handle bag, pointed pumps, and signature oversized sunglasses—helped elevate the ensemble, too. So who needs suiting when going against the status quo looks this good? The latest fashion news, beauty coverage, celebrity style, fashion week updates, culture reviews, and videos on Vogue.com.

 Happy birthday, Kendall Jenner! As someone who was born in the mid-’90s, it’s only natural that the top model has a fixation on the decade’s fashion, as her outfit choices this year have proved again and again. From jetting around international Fashion Weeks to her more off-duty looks, Jenner has spent much of her 23rd year leaning into signature ’90s pieces—all of which still somehow feel fresh and current. Think barely there thong mules, shoulder bags, and loads of vintage designer. Some of her best retro looks of note? When she stepped out in New York in September wearing a Versace slip dress with a hot pink lace trim; it looked like something supermodel Linda Evangelista would wear while partying with the late Gianni Versace himself back in the day. Jenner has also channeled the minimalism of the decade too, like when she stormed around Manhattan last month in a pared-back ensemble consisting of a simple black dress and matching knee-high boots. Meanwhile, Jenner’s been quietly reviving some of the decade’s best accessories as well, such as the flip-flop heels she’s been wearing nonstop, a shoe trend first ignited by sister Kim Kardashian West. Her favorite purse? It has to be the small-but-mighty shoulder bag—Bella Hadid’s also a fan—which was the must-have style during the decade as well as the ensuing early aughts. Below, explore five of Jenner’s best ’90s moments—and where to shop similar pieces.

 Unless you were hiding under a rock this past week, your Instagram feed was most likely flooded with Halloween costumes. There were several standouts, of course—one of which included a look from Kourtney Kardashian. The eldest sister of the Kardashian clan went as a 2019 version of Dolly Parton’s classic country style, and her sparkling outfit certainly would have made the Queen of Nashville proud: She wore a pink cowboy with a waterfall of rhinestone fringe, a metallic red coat, and itty bitty silver shorts. The winning accessory here? The dainty pink handkerchief around her neck. Others delving into the festive spirit were Hannah Dalton and Steven Raj Bhaskaran, the duo behind Fecal Matter, with a Voldemort-inspired look. But then again, Halloween or not, the pair are dressed up in fantastically, mind-altering looks 24/7; another recent hit included Dalton posing on a residential street in a black cape-meets-dress wearing her couture skin heels, that now come with an even larger platform. Of course, it wasn’t just those celebrating the year’s spookiest holiday that stood out. Over the past month, Natalia Vodianova and her family have been spending time in her motherland of Russia, and this week, she headed to a monastery to chop wood. Her lumberjack ensemble was appropriately runway-worthy, however: She wore a pair of slick brown boots—complete with a heel!—while swinging the axe. Another picturesque model moment came from Adwoa Aboah. In total Wes Anderson style, she traveled on the vintage Belmond British Pullman train from England to Venice while wearing a classic coat on top of a funky leopard print blouse—a stylish moment we can all get on board for. Here, see the best fashion Instagrams of the week. The latest fashion news, beauty coverage, celebrity style, fashion week updates, culture reviews, and videos on Vogue.com.

 Last year, even before the Hudson Yards’s new, massive arts venue The Shed was even finished being built, Arca (aka Alejandra Ghersi) inaugurated the space by performing within the construction site, making followers trail her around the half-built space. At one point, she sang on top of an upturned car, which looked almost like a shipwreck, floating in a pool of dirty water with its wheels still spinning. “For the Prelude to The Shed, I was really actually working through a trauma—like very consciously, in therapy—and I wasn’t sure if I should try and pretend that I wasn’t going through something,” the Venezuelan producer and artist explains of this first The Shed performance from her hotel room in downtown Manhattan. She’s been trying to get her Nintendo Switch connected to the TV so that she can play a video game she’s been obsessing over, but in the meantime Ghersi is sitting underneath a chandelier that she’s adorned with a long black wig, sipping Champagne and slowly eating french fries in a colorful, geometric Junya Watanabe top, paired with sparkling tights and black mary janes. “The gesture of having an upturned car was in relation to a car accident that I was in when I was very young—it wasn’t my car that flipped upside down, but one that I was staring at, and it was a really powerful image that kind of never left me,” Arca says, relating it to a recent experience near her house in Barcelona. “I was walking to the gym and I saw someone lying on the ground in a pool of blood. I walked into a crowd that was already standing still and silent, and everyone was in shock, standing still and silent. Everyone was reacting in totally different ways, myself included. I looked at someone in the eye and said something nice, like ‘How are you?’ I could feel myself disassociate. It’s beautiful that our minds do that to protect us from the ravaging, ripping, insane mystery of our own mortality,” she says. “That’s one of the things I love about fashion is it’s in virtue of that, not because of it or avoiding it or pretending that it doesn’t exist.” At the end of September, Arca returned to The Shed to debut the site-specific performance Mutant;Faith, which can best be described as a shape-shifting three-night showcase. There was also a five-hour epilogue—one that will eventually be turned into a music video—that found Arca holding court, communicating this vital interest in fashion to an especially captive audience (everyone had to lock their phone away upon entering the venue). Each night was completely different, as Arca flitted around the stage’s various setups—there was a mechanical bull, a stripper pole with sensors on it that rendered it into a theremin of sorts, and a pit filled with dirt in the center of the stage that she writhed around in. “At first it was an idea of self-immolation,” Arca says of her original conceit for these performances. “It then went through a lot of iterations.” There were long silences at times, which Arca admits demanded much endurance from the audience. “That was just my way of trying to let people know that I was present and that I was there, listening, and that I wasn’t on autopilot in any way, shape, or form.” More than anything else, though, it was a true collaborative effort. Total Freedom helped soundtrack much of each night, Björk joined her for a song at one point, and artist Carlos Sáez created robotic laser wings that Arca walked out of the theater wearing at the conclusion of one of the shows. With her laser wings creating the illusion of a full-out light show, she walked out of The Shed onto the High Line with a gaggle of fans behind her. “We would talk about what we find beautiful. I feel really grateful that we have the opportunity to choose collaborators that have shared goals. A creative act is a reconciliation of how deeply or softly or delicately one feels something to be and trying to express it through a show, because it’s a show after all—there’s smoke and light and lasers.” Nail artist Juan Alvear (who you might know better by his Instagram handle, @nailsbyjuan.nyc) also worked with Arca on different sets of surreal designs for the performances, crafting one set in particular out of crunchy sugar crystals. Arca ate them onstage to a semi-shocked crowd, who likely assumed they were acrylics. “I can’t believe some people sat through some of the insanity those nights,” Arca says, laughing. Working with stylist Natacha Voranger, Arca’s ever-changing onstage wardrobe mirrored the free-form nature of the show itself. While her show employed cutting-edge technology with all of the robotics and sensors, some of the pieces she wore onstage felt nostalgic by comparison. She brought back the mechanical legs that you probably first saw in the music video for “Reverie,” from her self-titled third studio album. They were originally designed for cosplay—they can be outfitted in just about any material, including fur, prosthetic skin, and more—but Arca leaves them bare and wears them as stilts. “They’re beautiful. I want to wear them until I die,” she says. Overall, the wardrobe for The Shed show almost charts Arca’s clothing archive over time. “I don’t throw stuff away. Vivienne Westwood once said something about wearing stuff until it falls apart. I don’t want to abandon pieces—I want to keep them around and let them morph.” The bullfighter’s jacket, too, is a recycled piece, one that Arca originally wore in that very same video. She spray-painted it red during one of the performances, which adds yet another chapter to its storied history—it was a handmade piece from Mexico that stylist Akeem Smith originally commissioned for her. Smith and Arca then sent it out to London-based designer Asai, who distressed it, and then on the video shoot a few years ago artist Jesse Kanda, one of Arca’s main collaborators, suggested that they treat it with a pearlescent glaze that prosthetics artist John Nolan uses. “I didn’t identify publicly as a trans woman then, and bullfighting being such a gendered blood sport, it had a different connotation for me this time around. I was thinking a lot about Talk to Her, Hable con Ella, the Pedro Almodóvar film. It’s about someone that has to tape her bullfighter jacket up tight over her breasts.” In addition to these ever-changing classics, Arca wanted Voranger to help push her aesthetic limits even further. “I always encourage her to bring accessories so we can propose a look based on many small pieces and not have too many statement pieces because the story I’m trying to tell is a battle-ready warrior princess in some ways. She’s kind of like Aeon Flux: She has a lot of skin exposed and she’s going through a battlefield.” With the floor-length, ruffled Vaquera gown that Arca and Voranger paired with the very cyberpunk Ikeuchi helmut, though, Arca reshaped her stylistic conceptions of this character. “I would never have chosen that because I’m always thinking about this form-fitted silhouette for this warrior princess. I really like that about working with Natcha—she shows me pieces I would have never thought to take off the rack to try on.” The Venezuelan flag that Arca fashioned into a dress on the first night, too, was Voranger’s idea—Arca just requested the flag, but Voranger insisted that they turn it into a halter dress by installing a makeshift drawstring—and Voranger also introduced Gauntlett Cheng to Arca’s distinct universe, after which she wore one of their signature wrap dresses onstage. There were also pieces from designers that Arca already knew that she loved, including some custom GmbH garments and some from Wesley Berryman (she says she’s obsessed with the Maleficent-esque shoulder silhouettes that he creates). As part of the show, Arca underwent multiple costume changes in front of the audience; she also had photographers and videographers capturing the whole thing, and her glam squad retouching her makeup in real time. “Those changing moments were so fun—this is just sharing my love for fashion and trying to be a doll,” Arca says of the meta nature of her show, which also consistently broke the fourth wall. At one point, she wasn’t sure what to do next, so she asked someone in the audience to offer up a suggestion (she was told to ride the mechanical bull, which she did). The playful, improvisational nature of the shows may have come as a surprise to those only familiar with Arca’s laser-sharp, distinctly dark sonic world, but Arca doesn’t see these as mutually exclusive. “I include gore and fear into the play. I recur to this term that I made up: mutant kawaii. It’s that there’s something cute and there’s something visibly mutated and maybe less common about this kawaii mutant,” she describes. “Sometimes it’s really cute and at other times, it’s thieving and has bloodlust and wants to eat entrails nonstop for centuries. I just let this creature shape-shift at its own pace without punishing or shaming any of its impulses and instincts.” Arca specifies that this limitless world only exists onstage, as she’s learned firsthand since her move from London to Barcelona two years ago. In her everyday life, when it comes to her sense of style, she says that she’s been thinking a lot about extroversion and flamboyance. “Sometimes I tell my boyfriend that people are staring at me because I don’t pass, and he’s like, ‘No, it’s because you’re dressed like a fucking cyborg. You’re in platform shoes in the supermarket.’” She then began toning it down more, after which she says she passed for the first time. “Now I’m coming full circle to finding pleasure in fashion. It really helped me work through and reach certain acceptances within myself. I started wearing heels way before I dared to even allow myself to ask for hormones.” For now, she’s just encouraging herself to play around in this interstitial zone between introversion and extroversion. “What I’m thinking about right now is what standing out means and what wanting to feel invisible means, because we all almost need that at certain points. Both of them are existential crises—if you blend in too much, what makes you different from anyone else? Is my individual spirit real? And if you stand out too much, you’re too much of a freak, so you’ll never belong.” She might be figuring out this balance in her everyday life, but onstage, Arca’s giving her inner mutant the spotlight.

 Karen Elson, Zac Posen, and Dita Von Teese at the 2014 Met Gala News broke today that Zac Posen is shuttering his namesake brand after months of negotiations with its partial owner. It’s a sad day for New York—as one of our homegrown talents, Posen is a beloved regular on the social scene—but also for Hollywood, where he reigned as king the of the red carpet. It was no less than Natalie Portman who helped turn Posen into a design star when she wore a retro-inspired midi-dress from his first collection to a Star Wars premiere in 2002. In the 17 years since, Posen has gone on to become the de facto couturier for Katie Holmes and added names like Rihanna, Sarah Jessica Parker, Iman, and Oprah Winfrey to his list of best clients. The reason women flocked to Posen was for his body-hugging creations, which accentuated all the right places—and covered the others in cascades of ruffles, artful darts, or mile-long trains. While corsetry was his signature, Posen could also cut a bias dress or flirty party frock with the best of them, all while still innovating on his technique. Earlier this year at the Met Gala, he partnered with GE on new technology to create rosettes for Deepika Padukone’s rose-color gown and craft a three-dimensional flower ensemble for Jourdan Dunn. How starlets will brave the camera flashes without a bit of Posen armor, we don’t know, but we can guarantee that these 19 of his best red carpet ensembles will make him sorely missed on the red carpets going forward.

 Dua Lipa’s already proved that she knows how to dress for a party—she did take on Electric Daisy Carnival in Las Vegas last year with her mom by her side, after all—but she takes her going out style to new heights in her new video for post-breakup disco anthem “Don’t Start Now.” The new visual, directed by Nabil, follows Lipa on a jam-packed (and slightly trippy) night out. First, she performs at a local pub, then she somehow finds her way into a masquerade ball surrounded partygoers sipping champagne in powdered wigs; finally, we find her dancing underneath a disco ball at a dimly lit nightclub. The video is also a fine showcase for Lipa’s expert post-breakup style. While dancing with a boy at the club, Lipa sings, “If you don’t want to see me dancing with somebody/If you want to believe that anything could stop me/Don’t show up, don’t come out/Don’t start caring about me now.” And with the strappy bright yellow Versace bra top and light wash Marni jeans that Lipa wears (she throws off her orange Raf Simons coat early in the clip), Lipa really does look carefree in the best way possible. What better way to handle a recent heartbreak than to go full disco queen? The latest fashion news, beauty coverage, celebrity style, fashion week updates, culture reviews, and videos on Vogue.com.
