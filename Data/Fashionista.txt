 With mobile shopping, peer-to-peer e-commerce and influencer marketing continually on the rise, social commerce is finally becoming the next wave of retail. The data doesn't lie. According to Pinterest and Polyvore, mustard yellow is going to be huge. Natural makeup is in, and overly complicated updos are out. These days, the crafty, do-it-yourself look of weddings is far more sophisticated. Plus, take a look at a video recap of the Guggenheim International Gala, sponsored by Dior. Pinterest is integrating shopping into its platform, too. And 'Teen Vogue' has tapped Sylvester Stallone's daughter for its March issue. When Pinterest users start thinking about the weekend, they think about fashion. Engagement with sponsored content is on the rise. Perhaps it's a better advertising platform than we thought. And Shailene Woodley looks absolutely lovely on the cover of 'Instyle.' Retailers hoping to bank on the rapid growth in mobile shopping that's happening right now should also look at Pinterest. On Thursday, Pinterest announced that its users can now pin animated GIFs to the platform, alongside the image and video formats it already supports. Gap, of course, is already on board. Victoria Beckham may have missed the mark this year when it came to getting Googled, but that doesn't mean the rest of the Internet forgot about her.  Go Riccardo Tisci! See how his latest campaign is breaking barriers in the fashion industry and more of Wednesday's hottest fashion stories.  Solidifying Pinterest's value as a sales driver, new research revealed that revenue driven by the platform on Cyber Monday was more than three times greater than the site's average.  So why are brands so focused on it? TGIF. Liu gets her reptile on and we've got photos of Meadham Kirchhoff's Topshop collaboration!

 It seems that more and more, brands and celebrities are foregoing traditional press rollouts to break news, opting to do it on their own terms over social media. (Just last week, Nicki Minaj debuted her KMart line over Instagram and last month H&M offered up a first look at its Isabel Marant collab over Twitter.) Today, J.Crew has unveiled its beloved September catalogue--in J.Crew speak, it's called a "style guide"--on Pinterest.   Yesterday, Bloomberg reported that social discovery/e-commerce site The Fancy had been valued at $600 million and that American Express and actor Will Smith had come on board as investors.

The Fancy has yet to officially confirm the news, but there's no doubt that now is an important time for the four-year-old site.

We spoke with founder and CEO Joseph Einhorn about what The Fancy is, how it's grown so quickly, the importance of having Kering's Francois-Henri Pinault on board, why Zara is one of his biggest inspirations, and more.
