 Black Friday 2018 is here, and as ever, we predict it to be the biggest online shopping weekend of the year in the UK. And with just three days to navigate those jaw-dropping Black Friday clothing deals (just in time for Christmas), we thought we’d make life that little bit easier for you with our guide to the best destinations, and what to look for while you’re there. From the Black Friday trainer deals and Black Friday dresses to the Black Friday watches, and Black Friday engagement ring sales (incase you’re thinking of popping the question this Christmas) we’ve got you covered.     Not only is Amazon a great place to sort out all your tech, it’s great for fashion presents too. For the weekend, it’s offering up to 50% off its private labels, which includes find coats and Meraki basics.

Photography: Carla Guler @carlaguler Styling: Harriet Davey @harriet.davey   The gorgeous Caroline Flack has had us all lusting over those locks and all-year-round tan for years, and now we can finally find out all her holiday tips, and then some. We caught up with the Love Island leading lady to find out all the goss about her latest venture; her very own collection with high street hotties, River Island.    T-shirt, £28, Caroline Flack x River Island The 19 piece collection is the capsule edit every girl will want to take on their summer vacay. And believe us when we say, you’ll want all of it. We’ve featured the collection in an exclusive shoot and interview in this week’s LOOK magazine, and this is the sneak peek you all deserve… Hey Caroline, congratulations on your new River Island collection! What’s your favourite piece?
Thank you! For me, it’s all about the pink kimono. I’m actually very self-conscious, especially on the first day of a holiday, so it’s good to throw on over a bikini.  Shoes, £55, Caroline Flack x River Island What makes you feel most confident on the beach?
Having a good tan; I always bronze-up beforehand. That, and a good haircut always makes me feel more confident. I love holiday hair. I always put in Bleach London’s Swamp Salt Spray and it just gives me that beachy look without any effort. Congratulations on your recent engagement. How shocked were you at Andrew’s proposal?
I knew we had something really different and special, so while I was shocked, I also wasn’t at the same time. We’d talked about it in the past but it was always in jest. He proposed at home when I was in my pyjamas, it was so cute. I had already seen the vintage ring I liked and pointed it out to him, never thinking it would be my engagement ring, but he remembered and got it for me. We already had a holiday to Santorini booked so it turned into an engagement celebration. I didn’t realise it was the basically most romantic island in the world!  Kimono, £80, Caroline Flack x River Island Love Island kicks off again on the 4th of June. What’s your day-to-day like when you’re presenting the show?
It’s the best job because you never have early starts. We don’t go on-set until 3pm so I have the day off to sit by the pool and have lunch. Then I’ll have hair and make up done and then we go and sit on-site. It really is a nice relaxing job until you start working in the evening. I make sure to fly back and forth so I still get to see my friends and family, too. How did you feel when Love Island won a BAFTA?
We were over the moon just to get nominated. We even had a Love Island nomination party to celebrate, so to win the BAFTA was just incredible. It was such a special evening; I’m not over it yet. When I got home my fiancée had put music on, lit candles and had wine waiting to celebrate – it was so romantic. This is the craziest, but the best year of my life. Grab this week’s LOOK magazine to see the full interview and shoot and shop Caroline’s River Island collection in-store and online from the 30th May. Unsure what to wear this ski season? Shop our skiwear edit and hit the slopes in style with chic pieces designed with form and function.  Packing for a week on the slopes always feels a little bit more overwhelming at first. Particularly when you stop and consider the looming padded jackets, trousers or multiple layers that are piled up alongside your case and it just all feels impossibly large to fit into a mere 20kg case. But, don’t panic. The key is to be super selective with what you purchase and pack. Whilst having a different jacket with you for each and every day might look great on the ‘gram, if neither of your options actually keep you warm you’ll be deeply regretting it when you’re shivering on a ski lift, only halfway up a mountain. Thankfully the high street has so many great affordable options that are both snug and stylish: letting you make the most of those runs!   Our Sarah-Rose Harrison recently visited the luxurious resort of La Plagne, within the French Alps, where both novice and experienced skiers can explore the beautiful mountains at their own pace and rate. Taking full advantage of classes and private lessons at Oxygene Ski School or, enjoying difficult couloirs and long off-piste descents. No longer a novice the slopes, packing for another season immediately felt less overwhelming and the essentials became even more clearer.   @SarahRoseGoes wears Superdry’s Slim Snow Puffer Jacket   So it might seem obvious but it’s pretty safe to say that the one item you don’t want to be without will be a snow jacket. Water and wind proof this is a must have! Superdry have a great selection of jackets (and trousers) which mix fashion with function so seamlessly. Designed for the slopes, their ski jackets tick all the boxes for practicality: with ski pass pockets, integrated snow shirts and that all important bungee cord hem (to stop your jacket filling with snow when you inevitably take a tumble) whilst also retaining the fashion forward elements of the brand which we all know and love. With optional elasticated waist belt and a detachable hoods with removable faux fur trims you can truly customise your look to ensure you feel your best while you’re on the slopes.   @SarahRoseGoes wears Mountain Warehouse’s Fresh Ice Jacket and Sub Zero Ski Pants The best way to shop and pack is from your base layers outwards. Vital for staying sung in sub zero temperatures so be sure to invest in a couple pairs of thermal leggings, rollnecks or long-sleeve tops to layer up with. Mountain Warehouse thankfully have the most extensive range of base layers, perfect for combating the cold and with prices starting at just £5.99 it’s great if you are on a shoestring budget. A one-stop-shop for everything from snoods to socks (always pick the thermal option!) you can kit yourself out entirely with functional yet, fashion forward kit. First timers who aren’t sure what to invest in or what to hire, ski resorts like La Plagne often offer skiwear to hire but this does add up so taking along your own essentials like hats, helmets, gloves and proper ski socks is highly recommended, and worth the space in your case. If you’re looking to invest in footwear that’ll see you from Chalet to Apres-Ski no boot comes more highly recommended than Sorel. Their iconic boot is often imitated but never equalled: completely waterproof construction, with faux-fur cuffs and micro-fleece lining they offer all the warmth, comfort and protection you could ever need during cold, icy, wet and slushy snowy situations.   So whatever your style and budget, our skiwear edit will help you look made for the mountain in no time…   From the editors of Marie Claire The Duchess of Cambridge is known for her impeccable style and wearing outfits more than once, and the Royal Wedding was no exception.   Kate chose to recycle an Alexander McQueen pale yellow tailored coat to accompany her daughter Charlotte down the aisle, leading the way for Meghan Markle in her Givenchy wedding dress.  She paired it with a matching Philip Treacy hat with floral detail, and Jimmy Choo shoes.   Now here’s where you’ve seen the outfit before. She first wore it for her daughter Charlotte’s christening back in July 2015, and then a year later for the Queen’s birthday in June 2016.  As for Princess Charlotte, she wore a custom made dress by Givenchy, to match the other bridesmaids. She accessorised with white leather Aquazurra shoes, monogrammed with her initials and the wedding date. The shoes are a gift from Meghan to the young ladies as a keepsake of the special day. Oh so chic. And find out what Prince Harry said to Meghan when he met her at the altar...  Meghan Markle’s wedding dress has finally been revealed. As millions gathered around their televisions, mobile phones and laptop screens to watch the Royal Wedding on Saturday morning, anticipation of what the bride would be wearing seemed to reach its peak.   There have, of course, been many rumours circulating about the designer that Meghan had chosen. But when she stepped out of the car just outside of St. George’s Chapel, that question was finally answered.  The 36-year-old surprised a lot of people by opting for a more traditional style. The gown was an A-line shape and was made from pure white silk, with a neckline that fell just off the shoulder. She added a little drama with her silk tulle train, which was five metres long and boasted a floral composition that represented all 53 countries of the Commonwealth.   The Palace revealed in a statement: ‘Ms. Meghan Markle’s wedding dress has been designed by the acclaimed British designer, Clare Waight Keller. Ms. Waight Keller last year became the first female Artistic Director at the historic French fashion house Givenchy.’ Meghan, who has always been a fierce advocate for women’s rights, was surely sending a message by selecting a female designer. The statement went on to explain that Meghan ‘also wanted to highlight the success of a leading British talent.’  Givenchy explained, ‘True to the heritage of the house, the pure lines of the dress are achieved using six meticulously placed seams. The focus of the dress is the graphic open bateau neckline that gracefully frames the shoulders and emphasises the slender sculpted waist. ‘The lines of the dress extend towards the back where the train flows in soft round folds cushioned by an underskirt in triple silk organza. The slim three-quarter sleeves add a note of refined modernity.’  The former Suits star wore her hair in an updo, and she accessorised with Queen Mary’s diamond bandeau tiara, lent to her by The Queen. Prince Harry, who was waiting for her at the end of the aisle, smiled when he saw her, telling her she looked amazing. We couldn’t agree more.

Very traditional From the editors of Marie Claire UK With less a fortnight until Meghan Markle and Prince Harry’s big day, the final details are slowly being confirmed ahead of the ceremony on 19 May.   All eyes have been on Meghan’s gorgeous engagement ring for the last six months but now, details have been announced about her (very traditional) royal wedding band. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will marry this month For generations, wedding bands for royal brides have been made with precious Clogau St David’s gold from Bontddu, North Wales, according to Hello! US.   The tradition was started by the Queen Mother when she got married in 1923, and the same nugget of gold from her band was used to make the wedding rings of Queen Elizabeth, Princess Margaret, Princess Anne and Princess Diana. In 1981, the Queen was presented with a new piece of 21-carat gold to be used for future royal weddings, so there’s plenty to go around for Meghan’s ring. It’s thought that it’ll be fairly similar to Kate Middleton’s simple band, shown below.  Meanwhile, it’s thought that Prince Harry will wear a wedding band, despite long-standing royal tradition. Like many royal men, his brother Prince William and grandfather Prince Philip don’t wear them. But it seems Harry wants to buck tradition like his father, Prince Charles, and wear one after all. ‘It is simply down to personal preference,’ a royal aide told the Daily Mail. The final countdown to the big day is on… Did you spot this? Selena Gomez sure knows how to make an entrance. The It Ain’t Me singer was amongst the Hollywood elite to make an appearance at the Met Gala on Monday night, and she’s had us all talking about her look ever since.    As an ambassador for Coach, it was only fitting that she would walk the steps of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in a show-stopping sheer frock from the brand. The theme was Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination, celebrating the continued influence of religion on the world of fashion and design.   A few seem to have questioned whether Selena’s gown worked with this theme, but we have spotted a subtle message that shows she did pay homage to the dress code.   Selena carried a handbag which appeared to incorporate a scripture quote. ‘A woman who fears the lord is a woman who shall be praised,’ it read. Making the message even more personal, it was embossed in Gomez’s very own handwriting. PEOPLE also reported that the words were sewn into her dress on a ribbon; this appears to be laying next to the Kisslock Frame bag in the brand’s Instagram photo.   You may remember that Selena enjoyed her Met Gala debut last year, also using the moment to make things red carpet official with her then-boyfriend The Weeknd. The pair have since called time on their romance, and the Wolves singer briefly rekindled her relationship with Justin Bieber a few months later. It is now believed that they too have parted ways, and Selena walked the carpet alone on Monday night. Selena did pose alongside fashion designer Stuart Vevers, who is the Creative Director of Coach and is working with the singer on her very own collection. Way to work it, girl. Princess Beatrice rocked up to the event in New York We didn’t expect a member of the Royal Family to turn up at last night’s Met Gala – but that’s exactly what happened. Princess Beatrice joined A-listers including Kim Kardashian, Rihanna and Blake Lively at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, wearing a violet Alberta Ferretti gown.   See: Met Gala 2018: All The Dresses  Giving her take on the theme of Heavenly Bodies: Fashion And The Catholic Imagination, the 29-year-old had opted for a floaty floor-length number. The piece featured a cinched-in waist, sheer sleeves and embellishments across the bodice.   She’d accessorised with a bejewelled headpiece and a boxy clutch, and added drama with a vampy smoky eye. Beatrice isn’t the first royal to rock up to the Met Gala, but she is the only member of the family to have attended for the past two decades. It was back in 1996 that Princess Diana made her mark at the annual event in a navy Dior slip dress and pearl choker necklace. Princess Diana attended the Met Gala in 1996 However, other royals from across the world are big fans of the ball. Queen Rania of Jordan, Princess Maria-Olympia of Greece and Monaco’s Charlotte Casiraghi have all been invited in the past. We’ve gotta say, after seeing Beatrice’s fash’ credentials on those famous Met stairs, we’re very excited to see what she wears to cousin Prince Harry’s wedding on 19 May.

The Keeping Up With The Kardashians star opted for a custom Versace chainmail gown with spaghetti straps, featuring beaded Byzantine cross motifs as a nod to this year’s theme; Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination.    The 37-year-old – who made headlines last week after unveiling her KKW Body perfume bottle, which celebrated all of the hard work that she’s been putting into the gym by immortalising her figure – was clearly keen to show off her hourglass shape, cinching her dress right in at the waist. Kim’s glam was on point too; the reality star opted for a super sleek half-up half-down ‘do (yup, we’re getting total Ariana Grande vibes) and a heavy smoky eye.    Looking hot, lady. It seems that hubby Kanye West approved, taking to Twitter to share a whole host of flame emojis alongside a picture of his girl. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 pic.twitter.com/yEYJP7qrvf — KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) May 8, 2018   Of course, many fans couldn’t help but notice that ‘ye wasn’t at the Met Gala himself. A few questioned why the rapper might have stayed home, particularly as he’s been making headlines with some pretty controversial comments recently. But fear not, all is well in the Kardashian/West household.   Kim took to her own Twitter account to squash any speculation before it even had a chance to really begin, offering a fair explanation as to why she had walked the red carpet solo. ‘Love you babe wish you were here with meeeeee but you’re only finishing up 5 albums,’ she wrote, alongside a laughing emoji and a love heart. No drama to see here, guys. The Met Gala is known for more than a show-stopping gown or two. It’s the night where a whole host of the celebrity elite join forces on the famous steps of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Last year the theme was Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Garçons: Art of the In-Between, and this was certainly reflected in the epic gowns and daring beauty looks that triumphed throughout the evening’s A-list guests. See: The Best Instagrams Of The Met Gala   For 2018 the Met museum’s exhibition is titled Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination. This year’s event was hosted by Amal Clooney, Rihanna, and Donatella Versace. We can never predict how the celebs will interpret themes but we always know their outfits will be impressive.

Continue shopping below… According to etiquette experts, we might know what the Duchess of Cambridge will wear for Prince Harry and Meghan's big day... Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s wedding day is right around the corner. Everyone wants to know what the bride is going to be wearing for her special day; with many looking to her Suits character’s white dress for inspiration, and designers even weighing in with their own thoughts about the style she might go for.   But it seems very likely indeed that we already know what Kate Middleton will be wearing for the occasion. Well, her accessory at least. The Duchess of Cambridge at the wedding of sister Pippa Middleton According to William Hanson, etiquette tutor at The English Manner, who spoke to Town & Country, it is considered proper etiquette for hats to be worn by female guests at a royal wedding.   Diana Mather, also a tutor at The English Manner, further told the BBC: ‘Up until the 1950s ladies were very seldom seen without a hat as it was not considered ‘the thing’ for ladies to show their hair in public.’ She then added, ‘all that has changed and hats are now reserved for more formal occasions.’  Of course fascinators are also now seen as a popular option when it comes to headwear, as seen on Princess Eugenie and Princess Beatrice of York at the wedding of Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge in 2011. Kate appears to be a fan of fancy headgear, having worn them on a number of previous occasions – including her sister Pippa Middleton’s wedding last year. All that’s left is to wait and see what colour and outfit she opts for – and, of course, whether baby Louis, who will be one month old, will make an appearance. The general consensus is that he probably will be there, although it’s unlikely that we’ll actually see him. HELLO‘s royal correspondent Emily Nash recently reported: ‘I would expect nanny Maria Borrallo or Carole Middleton to be on hand to look after Prince Louis while they are in St George’s Chapel. ‘But as he will be less than a month old, I’m sure Kate will want him nearby, even if we don’t see him at the service.’ Say Hello To Summer's Hottest Fashion Find...

There’s no denying that the designer knows bridal style, having spent almost 30 years in the industry. And while she’s confirmed that she won’t be creating Meghan’s gown, she’s got a strong idea of what the future royal will go for.   Vera tells Harper’s Bazaar: ‘Other than [wearing] us, and she’s not wearing us – there are two ways for her to go: American or British. Given her new position, her new status, and her new role, she’ll very well go British. ‘Neither full blown royal wedding like [Princess] Diana or Kate [Middleton], and neither narrow, sensual and more sexy – I think she’ll go somewhere in-between that feels a tad more modern.’ Vera Wang hopes Meghan’s dress is ‘not a mermaid but not a full blown royal proportion or anything theatrical’   When it comes to the shape and style of the dress, Wang hopes Meghan will choose ‘something maybe a tad subtler, not a mermaid but not a full blown royal proportion or anything theatrical. Given that she’s not marrying the future king, she’ll still be a royal, [but] there’s a lot to be done between those two worlds.’ Meghan, 36, and 33-year-old Prince Harry will wed at St George’s Chapel, Windsor Castle on 19 May. They’ll be joined by close friends and family in the church, while 2,640 members of the public have been invited to the castle’s grounds. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will marry on 19 May As for the rest of us, we’ll be waiting eagle-eyed for photographs to drop of Meghan in her dress (and Harry in his best, of course). It seems Vera will be doing the same, continuing: ‘I get royal wedding mania, and it’s amazing to be able to celebrate a royal wedding with an American – it brings attention to a sense of romance that in our present world we lack a bit of. ‘A royal wedding brings out things like hope, grandeur in all of us.’ Bring on 19 May!

With the British weather as unpredictable as ever, summer coats are an absolute necessity. Thankfully this season’s trend-led styles are super smart; from trenches to macs, parkas to rain coats. Even the most casual options have been cut with a purpose. Sleek, chic and ready to throw-on-and-go. You can never go wrong with a classic khaki military jacket or a neutral mac – throw over a Breton top and a pair of raw-hem jeans for the ultimate no-fuss #OOTD.     Here’s the LOOK edit of the best summer coats to buy and wear now…   Trade in your trench coat this spring, or update for a bold fashion-forward style. Standout floral styles provide a great opportunity to revive tried tees and jeans combos. Whilst a longline cut in an alternative hue can really add drama to your weekday wardrobe. We recommend looking for jackets which offer something more: it’s all in the details this spring so have fun and try-out something that’s a little bit ‘extra.’       Lightweight and preppy rain coats are something to have fun with this spring. Our favourite brands have gone bold and bright – and so should you!       By Erin Hill From the editors of PEOPLE   As Kate Middleton walked onto the steps of the Lindo Wing outside St Mary’s Hospital on Monday, all eyes were on her newborn son, who she cradled in her arms as she and Prince William introduced him to the world. Then, of course, attention was drawn to Kate’s red Jenny Packham dress with a white Peter Pan collar – a sweet nod to the dress Princess Diana wore after she gave birth to Prince Harry in 1984.    But the red dress wasn’t Kate’s only homage to the royal family that day. The mum-of-three chose to wear Queen Elizabeth’s stunning diamond and pearl drop earrings as she stepped out for the royal baby’s public debut. On loan from the Queen, the earrings are one of Kate’s favorites. She has worn them on several occasions, including during a 2016 visit to the Mauritshuis gallery in Holland, where she viewed the iconic painting Girl With A Pearl Earring. The Queen last wore them herself during her Diamond Jubilee celebrations in 2012. One of the best perks about having the Queen as your grandmother-in-law is the access to her royal jewellery box. From the Queen’s own wedding bracelet, the Lotus Flower tiara and her diamond-encrusted maple leaf brooch, Kate has borrowed several amazing pieces from Queen Elizabeth over the years.  Perhaps the most famous piece of royal jewellery Kate borrowed is also her first – the delicate Cartier Halo tiara she wore on her wedding day in 2011. William and Kate welcomed their third child – a prince – on Monday. Now that they are back home in Kensington Palace with their new baby boy, the couple have begun life as a family of five. ‘It completes them,’ royal biographer Ingrid Seward tells PEOPLE. A friend of the couple notes that Kate, 36, ‘is one of three siblings, and it’s a good family size. Boy-girl-boy is pretty cool as well.’ Parenthood, the friend adds, ‘suits them really well. They are enjoying it and are very happy’. Many are drawing comparisons between the Duchess of Cambridge and Princess Diana...  Kate Middleton gave birth to her third child, a son, at 11.01am on Monday morning. We all know the drill by now; following the announcement, Facebook feeds and TV news rooms were streaming constant updates from the door of the Lindo wing at St Mary’s hospital in London, waiting for their first glimpse of the new prince.    We didn’t need to wait long. About seven hours after giving birth, the Duchess of Cambridge stepped out onto those famous steps alongside her husband Prince William to introduce the world to the new addition to their family. Naturally, Kate was glowing in a red Jenny Packham number. Considering the new royal baby was born on St. George’s Day, many thought that she may have been referencing the patron’s day with her red and white ensemble.    Others were reminded of another royal occasion; when Princess Diana stood on the very same steps of the Lindo wing, holding Prince Harry. In September of 1984, the Princess of Wales introduced the cameras to her second child with Prince Charles. Diana wore a longline coat in the very same red shade, with white collar detailing.  Perhaps Kate was paying a touching tribute to Prince William’s mother? It wouldn’t be the first time. Whatever the reason behind the styling decision, we’re applauding her for wearing anything besides a pair of tracksuit bottoms so soon after giving birth. That’s what you’d find us in, tbh. Gorgeous as ever, KM. The family have some news... By Anna Francis From the editors of CelebsNow   Kim Kardashian has made a big family announcement, and it’s left many fans pretty gutted. The reality star revealed via her website on Thursday that she and sisters Kourtney and Khloe have decided to close their DASH fashion stores, which they first opened back in 2006. ‘After nearly 12 years, my sisters and I have decided to close the doors of our DASH stores,’ Kim, 37, wrote in a post she labelled a ‘bittersweet announcement’.   ‘We opened our first store as a family in 2006 and, since then, we have made so many lifelong memories. From opening locations in Los Angeles, Miami and New York, to having our “Dash Dolls” spin-off show, it’s been such a huge part of our lives.’   Kim went on to suggest that they’ve made the decision so that they can focus on their other ventures as well as family lives. ‘We’ve loved running DASH, but in the last few years, we’ve all grown so much individually,’ she explained. ‘We’ve been busy running our own brands, as well as being moms and balancing work with our families. ‘We know in our hearts that it’s time to move on. We love our DASH Dolls and are so grateful for the amazing memories. ‘And we have to give a special thanks to the DASH employees and all of the incredible fans and customers who have supported us throughout the years! We couldn’t have done it without you. Thank you to everyone!’  The news has been met with sadness from many of the family’s followers. ‘Omg this is an end of an era,’ one admirer wrote on social media, whilst another said: ‘NOOOOOOOO @dashboutique we will miss you so much.’ And one added: ‘Awwwww I’m so sad to hear this!’ Kim, Kourtney and Khloe opened the first DASH store – which sold high-end designer clothes – in California in 2006 and went on to launch shops in Miami and New York.  Fortunately for fans the boutiques will remain open until 28 May while the website will cease trading after 20 May. It’s come at a pretty busy time for the ladies, what with 33-year-old Khloe having given birth to her baby daughter True last week. Kim and Kourtney, 39, have also got their hands full juggling business projects with looking after their children. Fortunately for those disappointed by the end of DASH, there’ll be plenty more Kardashian action on our screens soon as the fam are reportedly filming yet another series of their show. The Suits actress's bag proved she won't be bowing to usual royal protocol Since getting engaged to Prince Harry, Meghan Markle has well and truly cemented herself as a royal style icon. But she doesn’t always follow the Queen’s usual guidelines, swapping demure dresses for smart trousers and teasing her hair into messy buns.   At the Commonwealth Heads Of Government meeting earlier this week, the 36-year-old once again proved that she won’t be bowing to tradition. As she and Harry, 33, met delegates from across the world, Meghan wore a £171 cross-body bag by Australian brand Oroton.    That may not sound particularly significant, but if you take a look at photos of Meghan’s future sister-in-law Kate Middleton, you’ll notice that she never strays from a classic clutch. There’s a good reason for this. Last year, the founder of Beaumont Etiquette – Myka Meier – explained to Good Housekeeping: ‘When the Duchess is at an event, she holds her bag in front of her in both hands when shaking hands might be awkward.’ So, is Meghan breaking protocol by not following in Kate’s footsteps? Actually, it seems not.  Etiquette expert William Hanson doesn’t think Kate needs to hide behind her clutch, telling MailOnline: ‘The Duchess of Cambridge may well prefer not to shake hands with certain people – but there are other ways to achieve this, as used by the Queen and other members of the Royal Family. ‘It is protocol that you do not extend your hand to any member of the Royal Family (blood royal or those who have married in to the family) unless their hand extends first. ‘With more experience, the Duchess of Cambridge will soon realise that she needn’t be too nice, extend and shake hands with everyone. A courteous smile at those whom she does not have time to shake hands will suffice.’ Kate Middleton always carries a clutch So while Meghan may be doing things differently to other royals, she isn’t crossing any boundaries. And we love that she and Kate, 36, have their own personal looks. We can’t wait to see them together more once Meghan becomes a Mrs! It looks like she'll wear TWO gowns on her big day By Rachael Martin From the editors of Good To Know   Meghan Markle is reportedly planning on copying Kate Middleton when it comes to what she will wear on her big day by choosing not one, but two wedding dresses to wear. Sources close to the actress have apparently revealed that the fashion-loving bride-to-be has decided on two gowns for her wedding day – one traditional, sophisticated dress for the ceremony and reception at Windsor Castle, and one slightly more edgy and glamorous gown for the evening reception at Frogmore House. Meghan Markle and Prince Harry will marry next month   A source divulged to Vanity Fair that Meghan wants an outfit that is ‘less restrictive’ for the reception so that she can ‘party the night away’ with fun-loving Prince Harry and their friends. ‘She will have two dresses, one for the ceremony and another dress for the evening,’ the insider reportedly revealed. ‘The plan is for her to change after the ceremony so that she can party the night away in something glamorous and less restrictive. Meghan can’t wait to surprise everyone, especially Harry.’ If Meghan does indeed opt for two dresses for her big day, she will be following in her future sister-in-law’s footsteps, as Kate Middleton also chose to wear two wedding dresses when she married Prince William in 2011. Kate Middleton wore a lace dress for her wedding ceremony Kate wore a now-iconic Alexander McQueen gown for her wedding ceremony at Westminster Abbey, and then changed for a more intimate evening reception with around 300 guests. Kate’s lesser-known second wedding dress was also created by Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen. The bespoke satin gown was still a floor length wedding dress, but proved slightly easier for the Duchess to move in without a long train and veil. As well as following Kate’s lead in opting for two wedding dresses for her big day, it seems like Meghan might also take a leaf out of her book when it comes to bridal style. Kate Middleton changed into a second gown for her reception According to sources, Meghan is considering lace sleeves for her wedding gown, which Kate also had. The source continued: ‘The wedding dress itself will be traditional and elegant. There is talk of some lace and sleeves and Meghan has been working very closely with the designer who has been sworn to secrecy.’ We’ll have to wait until 19 May to discover what Meghan will actually wear, but we’re sure what ever she chooses she’ll look absolutely stunning! Summer dresses are a must-have for every fashion lover. Yup, it's getting to that time, ladies.

Happy shopping! ‘I want to do your special day. Let me do everything.’ From the editors of Marie Claire UK TV presenter and comedian Alan Carr married his longterm partner Paul Drayton in January, having got engaged in 2016 during a trip to Indonesia.   While Alan announced at the time that the couple had wed in a ‘small, private ceremony’ with their wedding planner, it was only revealed this week who their wedding planner was – and we definitely couldn’t have expected it. Breaking the news in an interview on ITV’s This Morning, Alan Carr revealed that it was Adele – yes, Adele – who helped the couple tie the knot, getting ordained for the occasion.     Adele then confirmed the rumours, posting a photo of herself in white robes in front of a Beyoncé-style rose wall, alongside the caption: ‘Seeing as the cat’s out the bag. I married two of my best friends in January. You know me any excuse to dress up… #LoveisLove.’ But according to Alan, Adele did much more than officiate their wedding, she was also their wedding planner, holding the ceremony in the back garden of her Los Angeles home, organising the food and the flowers and singing for the couple as they shared their first dance. ‘She’s known me and Paul for ages, and she said: “I want to do your special day. Let me do everything,”’ Alan explained on This Morning. ‘So she did everything, and she got ordained, and she married us. She is the kindest, most sweetest, loveliest person ever. ’It was the best day of my life.’ Umm Adele, can we book you in too? We caught up with the star to find out everything about her latest gig, and what's going on in her personal life... Madison Beer is making a very big name for herself. She’s just released her very first EP ‘As She Pleases’, announced a sold-out European tour across 14 venues, and now? The star – who you’ll probably know best as the one whose voice was uncovered by Justin Bieber via Twitter – has just released a 63 piece collection with Missguided. We caught up with her for all the goss… What made you want to work with Missguided?   Missguided listens to everything I say and really get me, they’re really on board with my style. What’s your fave piece from the Madison Beer Missguided collection? The fanny pack.   How will you wear it? Everything under the sun, at night with a dress or during the day with a hoody, they go with everything and black goes with everything.  Top, £18, Madison Beer x Missguided Skirt, £25, Madison Beer x Missguided What’s been your fave part of the design process so far? Seeing it come to life, it’s been really cool to hold a piece of my clothing line, it’s sick. Who would you most like to see in your designs? Rihanna. Who would you least like to see in your designs? Donald Trump. Where do you usually shop? 90% of my clothes are from vintage stores. It’s not about where you buy but how you look. What’s your fave high street store? Urban outfitters. I’m really basic when it comes to stores.  Top, £25, Madison Beer x Missguided Trousers, £40, Madison Beer x Missguided Do you have a stylist or do you dress yourself? I only have a stylist when I go to big events but even then I give them moodboards to show exactly how I want to look so I’m mostly in control. I dress myself on a daily basis though. What’s your daily skincare routine? Literally just a Tatcha cleansing oil, nothing else, that’s literally it. I sometimes use the title Sunday Riley moisturiser. I stopped using make up wipes and it made my skin so much better, they messed up my skin big time. And make-up? Just a bit of concealer and bronzer, I try not to wear make up as much as I can. Im not big on make up. I only have a make up artist for events.  Crop top, £15, Madison Beer x Missguided Shorts, £25, Madison Beer x Missguided What regular beauty treatments do you have? I’m not so pampered, I’m not that kind of girl, but I do love a good massage. I don’t really get girls that are obsessed with pampering like that. If you could only have 1 beauty product/regular treatment for the rest of your life, what would it be? Lip balm or face moisturiser. When my face feels dry I hate myself. How often do you workout? What’s your routine? I could count on one hand how many times I’ve worked out. I walk up a flight of stairs and I’m fully winded like I’ve just ran a marathon but the tour is definitely helping me build up my stamina since I’m on stage every night. SEE: Exclusive: Jourdan Dunn On Her New Missguided Collection What do you eat in a day? Junk, all day every day. Everytime I feel like I’m gaining a bit of weight I’ll eat healthily for like 3 days then I’ll be like ‘oh I look skinny again’, then I’ll go back to eating bad, but I tell myself it’s ok, I’m only 19 so I can do it while I can. My mum and I are similar in that sense – she’s like ‘I started my diet yesterday now I’m in bed eating an ice cream cake’. Do you have a trainer? Absolutely not. Can you describe what happened when you found out Justin Bieber had discovered you? I uploaded a Youtube vid and expected to get like 100 views from people in my hometown. He tweeted three times, but I remember I was in bed one time and my friend Nicole called me to tell me what had happened, and the next thing I knew Good Morning America were knocking at my door. How quickly did things change for you? Overnight. I signed with a huge agency the same week. I was freaking out.  Trousers, £22, Madison Beer x Missguided Top, £12, Madison Beer x Missguided Are you still friends with him? Yeah we are good friends, he’s still one of my close friends. Is music still your biggest career focus, or are you hoping to work more in fashion? I haven’t always been a fashionista, but I’ve only recently got fully into it. We know you’re going on tour this summer, what other plans do you have? Any holidays? It’s my first tour. I’m playing at a few festivals. Do you have a lot of time for friends and relationships with everything going on in your career? I don’t have much time to see my friends, I wish I had more. I don’t have any holidays planned, I’m not even going to Coachella this year, it’s not that amazing, I went last year and I didn’t love it so I’m not that upset that I’m not going again. What’s your fave thing to do with friends? I’d rather just chill and watch Rick and Morty or maybe some movies. And boyfriend? I don’t have a boyfriend at the moment, I just chill with everyone.   The full collection is available now at Missguided, and trust us when we say you’re going to want it a-l-l. And it's lovely From the editors of Marie Claire UK It might be 20 years since Princess Diana’s death, but her sons Prince William and Prince Harry still make an effort to commemorate her wherever possible, from taking on her charity work to making her memory a part of their milestone moments.   With Prince Harry set to marry former Suits actress Meghan Markle next month, their wedding will be no exception. ‘It’s so important to me to know that she’s a part of this with us,’ Meghan explained in the couple’s official engagement interview, and true to her word, the 36-year-old is said to be paying some subtle tributes to Princess Diana on the big day, making her a part of the celebrations. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will marry on 19 May   It was reported that Meghan might be teaming her designer wedding dress with Princess Diana’s family tiara, the Spencer tiara, depending on whether or not it can be loaned from the exhibition that it’s currently displayed in – but that isn’t the only tribute being paid to Diana on 19 May. Apparently Meghan will be paying tribute to Princess Diana with her wedding bouquet, including white garden roses to symbolise Prince Harry’s mother.  ‘Prince Harry and Ms. Markle have chosen floral designer Philippa Craddock to create the church flowers for their wedding,’ Kensington Palace announced to Twitter. ‘The floral displays in St George’s Chapel will be created using locally sourced foliage, much of which will be taken from the gardens and parkland of The Crown Estate and Windsor Park.’   Guess she'll have to choose from a hundred others then By Megan C. Hills From the editors of Marie Claire UK   While everybody’s speculating about who’s going to be Meghan Markle’s wedding dress designer, we now know one thing for sure – she won’t be wearing an iconic piece of royal jewellery on her wedding day. More specifically, Kate Middleton’s wedding tiara isn’t going to be making an appearance as it’s off on tour. Kate’s Cartier ‘Halo’ tiara is currently making the rounds in Australia, where it’s one of the centrepieces of a fine jewellery retrospective called Cartier: The Exhibition. However, the exhibition runs from March 30 – July 22 and Meghan’s wedding to Prince Harry is smack bang in the middle of it on May 19, meaning it won’t be available.    The tiara is an important part of royal history beyond Prince William and Kate’s wedding, as it was Queen Elizabeth II’s 18th birthday gift from her own mother, who was given it by her husband King George VI (it’s the ultimate hand me down). The platinum tiara features almost 900 diamonds, set with a crowning centrepiece diamond in the middle.  Although Meghan won’t be picking up Queen Elizabeth’s Halo for her big day, we’re sure she’s spoiled for choice – she is marrying into the family that owns the royal jewels, after all. When her sister-in-law-to-be isn’t donning one of her iconic Kate Middleton hats, Kate’s previously borrowed accessories such as a pearl-embellished Princess Diana tiara and Queen Elizabeth’s Lotus Flower Tiara. It wouldn’t be unheard of for the royal family to loan Meghan something sparkly for her big day. Given that Meghan Markle will apparently be taking style pointers from the late Princess Diana’s style playbook, we have a strong feeling that she’ll probably wear one of her mother-in-law’s accessories. We for one think it’s about time the Spencer came out of the woodwork, as it’s too beautiful a piece to be collecting dust in a drawer somewhere. Plus, it would be a sentimental gesture given that it was Princess Diana’s wedding tiara as well. Princess Diana passed away in 1997 Kate’s wedding tiara is joined by over 300 other pieces of Cartier bling, which have belonged to a whole range of people including celebrities, billionaires and more. It’s in royal company alongside Princess Grace of Monaco’s 10.48 carat diamond engagement ring, as well as Dame Elizabeth Taylor’s show-stopping diamond and ruby necklace. Hunting for the best sportswear used to be, let’s face it, a bit of a mission. First of all, you have to identify the best kind of clothes for your chosen activity. You know the drill; you’ll need looser garments for yoga and tighter pieces for high impact sport. Once that’s been decided, the next step is to filter through all the different brands and price ranges until, suddenly, shopping for the gym has lost all its motivational feeling and left you, well, in a bit of a flap.   Well, luckily, there has never been a better time to shop women’s sportswear, with many of the high street giants now stocking their own ranges of specialised gym wear that is both stylish and affordable. From Primark sportswear to H&M, most of our beloved high street stores are now offering entire collections of gorgeous sportswear pieces to suit all body shapes and sizes. What’s more, many of their tops and vests start below the £10 mark. Plus, many also have a great selection of accessories such as yoga mat bags, gym locks and backpacks to complete your workout wardrobe. Our fave has to be the new collaborative collection between Urban Outfitters and Sergio Tacchini which totally ticks off this season’s 90s athleisure trend.   While sportswear giants such as Nike and Adidas are still creating gorgeous ranges of women’s sports clothing that look just as chic off-duty as they do working the treadmill, there are a few under-the-radar brands we’ve fallen for. Look to Varley for bold prints, or Active In Style for chic pieces that have also been spotted on some of our fave A-listers. Marie Claire UK, the premium fashion and beauty magazine brand, has also launched its very own sportswear range, designed for women who want fashion-forward active wear for use in and out of the gym. The result? Camo print vests, innovative leggings that mould to the legs and slim line vests. Basically everything you could ever wish for in sportswear. All in all, we’re more than excited about all the fun sportswear available right now. Let’s get sweaty! With summer just around the corner, and women's sandals taking over the high street, there's no better excuse to treat yourself to a new pair (or three)...  Sandals are a holiday season must-have, right? We’d be willing to bet that you’ve been living in your ankle boots for the past six months; the thought of getting our feet out and embracing warmer climes is definitely an appealing one.   As always, the high street is boasting some serious style when it comes to summer sandals; from Topshop to New Look, you’ll be spoilt for choice. And with so many different options, we’ve picked out some of our favourite trends of the season to try and help you on your way…            As you can see, there’s plenty of colour to choose from; whether you’re after white sandals or go-to gold. Or if you fancy a pop of colour, then why not be brave and try an orange or bright pink hue? Taking you from day-to-night, some statement footwear really is the perfect way to update your wardrobe. Style with the perfect summer dress and an oversized tote bag, or simply slip on with your favourite bikini and cover-up for a relaxing day poolside. And if you’re in the market for that perfect festival flat then worry not; we’ve got it covered. From kooky pom-poms to colourful tassels, your perfect festival footwear is also in our round-up. Still haven’t found your dream pair? Fear not, we’ve picked out many more options in our edit below… Happy shopping. Imagine all of the #OOTDs...  Sock boots are firmly on our radar, thanks to a stylish array of fashion bloggers, street stylers and A-listers who have been plastering them all over Instagram. And when a shoe gets Instagram famous, you know it’s time to take notice…     See: Best Ankle Boots Why do we love them? Well, firstly, the snug stretchy lining means that they keep your ankles oh-so-warm (which is very necessary when you have to suffer through this dodgy British weather).   Secondly, they look epic with kick flares. Seriously. Just add a cute roll-beck jumper and you’re nailing that ’70s look like a dream.   What’s also brilliant about the humble sock boot is that the high street is awash with pairs in every single colour and texture. Topshop, River Island and Zara are all nailing the trend right now. See: Best Primark Boots They also tend to come with block heels, meaning you’re not only nailing a hot trend (two birds, one stone), but you’ll also be super comfy when you’re stomping around in your new sock-shaped beauties. Sock boots are also the perfect day-to-night option, meaning you can wear them to look sassy at work, but also leave your mates gawping when you hit the bar for cocktails later that evening. In a nutshell, we’re hooked. Your shopping enabler is back. Considering the amount of time we spend scouring the new-in sections of our favourite high street stores, we like to think that we’re shopping experts (or, at least, that works as a justification for the amount of £££ we spend on our ‘drobes). We love nothing more than having a cheeky gander at what’s dropped at the likes of Zara, M&S and River Island, but today we’re bringing you the best bits from Topshop’s new-in section.   Since we first discovered the joy of shopping as a teenager, Topshop has been by our side through many a sartorial crisis. From their superior denim selection to their could-be-catwalk pieces and seriously covetable collaborations, our faithful Toppy never lets us down. Their website is one of our bookmarked shopping destinations and the new-in section is always bursting with must have pieces. And if you find that the overwhelming selection sends you into a frenzy, panic not, because we’re here to help. We’ve rounded up our current favourites to save you some searching. Think of this as your handy guide to the soon to be ‘it’ pieces. No hanging around though, these gems are likely to be snapped up pretty speedily.   Happy shopping!  A vintage-inspired cropped cover-up with popper and belt details, this little number will instantly update any outfit.  Whether you’re looking for a trendy alternative to a wedding guest dress, or you want to make a statement in the office, this bold blue suit definitely stands out from the crowd.  Everything about this screams festival season. You’ll be Coachella-ready in no time.  Because it’s never too early to start shopping for sunnier climes.  The trusty denim jacket has been given a sunny update, and we’ve forgotten about the rain already.  Animal print never really seems to go out of style, and we’ve been dreaming about this leopard shirt ever since we first laid eyes on it.   
 Date or no date, we’ve rounded up the hottest new high street lingerie that will have you looking and feeling your best... Lingerie really does have the potential to make or break an outfit. In fact, no matter what any woman says, there’s no denying that a good lingerie set can be the ultimate confidence-booster and, in turn, give your look the finishing touch it needs. Whether it’s a casual jersey ensemble, or a little lacy number, here at LOOK we are adamant that lingerie is the key to making a woman look and feel fantastic (trust us, we’re talking from experience!) Man or no man, lingerie shopping sits firmly at the top of our list of favourite things to do, so we’ve decided to put together our edit of the best pieces available now. Aren’t we good to you? From Marks & Spencer to Topshop and Freya to Figleaves, the high street is in pretty good stead when it comes to lingerie. Red hot lace numbers permeate the shelves of Primark whilst H&M plays host to some of the best bralets we’ve ever laid eyes upon.   But the best part? The lingerie we’ve handpicked for you comes in at under £6 per piece – for something totally timeless (and essential), we’d say that’s pretty good going. As if that wasn’t enough, the underwear as outerwear trend is still taking the fashion world by storm since hitting the catwalks last year. If you’re feeling brave, why not try a boyfriend blazer and bra combo, or a silk cami paired with a black biker jacket. Go on, we dare you. All in all, we’d say lingerie is having a bit of a moment right now – and we’re jumping right on board. Join us? Searching for beautiful dresses for a wedding guest? You've come to the right place...  Wedding guest dresses are all over the high street, so if you’re looking for the perfect women’s dress to rock to that special occasion then it really doesn’t have to break the bank. While the bride is busy looking through the best high street wedding dresses, you can have fun picking out your own wedding guest outfit. 
     Opt for breathable fabrics if it’s going to get hot during the day, and be aware how sleeve length might affect you.   For summer, you can play around with prints and colours.  Winter needs warmth. Fact. But that certainly doesn’t mean you have to compromise on style. When it comes to colour, high street offerings might not be as bright as they would be in summer, but you can still jazz up your dress up with colourful accessories. Prints are a go-go, too – choose between everything from florals to animal print. And, don’t forget, you can always layer with tights and a smart jacket.    The high street always has a great selection of maternity dresses, and it’s no different when it comes to wedding guest shopping. ASOS and Topshop both boast a whole range of maternity outfits, so you and your bump can look your best on the big day, and you can add your own style statement with funky jewellery or a pop of lipstick.   With more and more weddings happening abroad, there’s a real demand for an evening outfit that’s also fit for the beach. Thankfully, the high street has plenty – just keep in mind that you’ll need to pack your outfit for a plane journey.  Whether you’re the mother of the bride or groom, it’s important to look the part. You’ll want to appear smart, but on trend at the same time. Choose something long-sleeved and midi length for double demure vibes, or go for one or the other and add a sleek cropped cover-up. And trends? Keep them the same – think floral, pleats, or asymmetric hems- and you’re officially the most stylish mum around.  Plus size wedding guest dresses are widely available. It can be hard to find a dress that properly flatters your figure, but the high street has really caught up. Choose ruffle shoulders if you’re narrow, or go for a cinched style to highlight the waist and/or create the illusion of curves. If you’re athletic, avoid straight styles, and if not, be sure to highlight your assets. There really is something for everyone. Happy shopping! There's a very inspirational story behind Meghan's choice of handbag...  Meghan Markle has done it again. If there’s one thing we can guarantee, it’s that Prince Harry’s bride-to-be is going cause something of a frenzy when she steps out of the house. Everyone wants to know what she’s wearing, how she’s done her hair and what she’s got to say.   The royal couple, who sent out their wedding invitations this week, paid a surprise visit to Northern Ireland on Friday to visit the Eikon Centre and attend an event celebrating the youth-led project Amazing The Space. Prince Harry actually launched the programme last September, which also marked his first visit to Belfast.     With fiancée Meghan on his arm, the pair watched performances by local schools and also met with young people to hear, first hand, about the reconciliation work going on across Northern Ireland. Both Harry and Meghan have made it clear that they share a passion for supporting the younger generation, so backing Amazing The Space – an initiative that encourages young people to become ambassadors for peace – is a very good fit.  The former Suits actress looked amazing, as always, opting for a teal skirt and cream jumper combo. She styled her outfit with a trench coat and her signature messy bun, but it was her arm candy that’s really got our attention. Designed by Charlotte Elizabeth, who has her own leather brand, this small leather tote bag is actually called Bloomsbury, and comes in at just £175.   The girl behind the British brand, Charlotte Elizabeth herself, started the company when she was just 21-years-old. With zero training or experience in the industry, she went on to launch her own accessories brand – with her own designs – from her bed, having became paralysed. At the age of 19, Charlotte attended a course through the Prince’s Trust in order to learn about how to set up a business. Sadly, two weeks later, she ‘suddenly collapsed’ and ‘lost all muscle ability within seconds,’ she told The Telegraph back in 2016. But this didn’t stop her. Despite feeling like she wanted to give up at times, she had something to focus on. ‘I thought if I can create something through all of this I can do anything,’ she explained. ‘That’s why my business is so special to me as it started at the absolute rock bottom. It has been with me through my worst moments.’ Of course, with the Meghan Markle effect in full swing, she’s been inundated with attention since today’s public appearance. ‘It was wonderful to see Ms. Markle wearing Charlotte Elizabeth Chestnut Bloomsbury today,’ she told us. The fact that Meghan chose to carry this accessory not only shows a subtle nod to her future father-in-law, whose charity helped Charlotte at the very beginning, but it also shows – once again – that Meghan is committed to supporting future generations of young women. If you’ve got it, flaunt it… From the editors of InStyle UK Kate Upton may have shimmied down the aisle last November but just like any bride, the model-turned-actress is still sharing snapshots from her big day. This time, she’s revealed her ever-so sheer evening ensemble.   For her medieval church wedding set in the heart of Tuscany, Kate was the epitome of an angelic bride. Wearing a Valentino gown that could have been plucked from a mid-century couture house, it encased her famous assets to perfection.   See: Celebrity Weddings: The Biggest And The Best   But come the evening Kate was back to her siren best, wearing a rather sheer floor-length sequin encrusted number, to cut her cake and dance her way into the rest of her life. The dress itself was a custom-made number from the studio of Christy Rilling and if it wasn’t revealing enough there was split hem for extra measure. Following her wedding to baseball ace Justin Verlander, Kate told Vogue US: ‘I had such a great time creating the fashion story for my wedding weekend! For my ceremony dress, I had the pleasure of collaborating with the fantastic team at Valentino. They are the best at creating delicate, beautiful lace and details, and their Italian heritage kept the fashion and feel authentic to our venue. The design process was extremely collaborative, so I was able to really include my personal style and create my dream dress.’   Even if you have Valentino designing a gown for your big day it turns out one still can’t resist mixing it up for the evening events. What a bride you were Kate Upton. This is the definition of a ‘babeing bride’. It won't be around for long... By Amy Hunt From the editors of Woman & Home   Kate Middleton today stepped out to complete her final royal engagement before she heads off on maternity leave. The Duchess of Cambridge and husband Prince William headed to Stratford, London to visit Sports Aid at the Copper Box Arena. They met with wheelchair basketball players, who are all hoping to compete in the 2022 Commonwealth Games. Later, they helped prepare a Big Lunch, in aid of the Commonwealth celebrations. Kate, 36, looked as chic as ever during the day’s events. She opted for a sophisticated but relaxed outfit choice, wearing jeans and a simple floral top with a white coat, by maternity designer Goat.    But it was Catherine’s top that caught the attention of fashion fans everywhere. She opted for a Hobbs number which is a surprisingly affordable price. While the ‘Rosie’ top was on sale for £79, it’s now been reduced to just £49. Hobbs customers can also purchase the royal-approved piece for a further discount of £44.10, with a special 10% offer at Hobbs. The top has sold out on the Hobbs website, but it may come back into stock. Keep a look-out here. However, John Lewis are also selling the top too, and still have size 12s available. Have a browse here.  Buy now Catherine’s Hobbs’ top is one of her most affordable fashion choices recently, although they are a designer she’s regularly favoured over the years. While the Duke and Duchess’s engagements today will be Catherine’s last before starting her maternity leave, it’s thought that their third baby isn’t due until near the end of April. It has been rumoured that the new royal arrival is set to appear around 23rd April – aptly, on St. George’s Day. The Duchess is of course due to give birth just weeks before her brother-in-law Prince Harry’s wedding to Meghan Markle, on 19th May. *Adds all to basket What do we love more than a new celeb collaboration? A new celeb collaboration that doesn’t require a new credit card. Enter – actress and singer Zendaya’s new high street drop. The Hollywood star who has a casual 49.1million Instagram followers (and has starred alongside heart-throb Zac Efron, FYI) has a spring edit with Brit brand Boohoo.com, and we’re obsessed.    Jacket, £25, Zendaya x Boohoo.com Skirt, £18, Zendaya x Boohoo.com   Following on from the likes of Kylie Jenner’s bestie Jordyn Woods and popstar Charli XCX, Zendaya is the latest A-lister to edit her own collection for the online giants. Choosing her favourite 50 pieces from the spring line, she describes the capsule as ‘effortless and simply cool’. With everything from sunny yellow denim updates, deckchair stripes and every top you’ll ever need to add to your jeans and a nice top combo, we want in. Luckily for us all then, the collection has just dropped online right now. And guess what? LOOK is in LA as we type with mega-babe Zendaya to attend her launch party at the Dream Hotel and see the drop up close and personal, with the girl herself. Aside from her eyebrows, we want her style and this is a sure-fire way to get it seen as she told us ‘the best thing about my personal style is that i just don’t have one, it somehow all just works together. My fans will love my edit as they’re chic, fashion forward and love clothes.’ Yep, you’re right Ze, who wouldn’t love it? If we had it our way we would snap up all 50 pieces to look *just like Zendaya. *OK, kind of. But we have to pick our faves and after seeing them all, it has to be the striped tie front crop top. If there’s anything that makes us want to stay in the sunshine, it’s this. We’ll be teaming it with mom jeans and woven mules for spring, and layering it over a bikini with a straw bag for those summer hols. It’s basically the only top you need for new season. Best part? It’s only £16. Win-win.  Crop top, £16, Zendaya x Boohoo.com, coming soon Obvs, we can’t pick just one. We’re also obsessed with these scalloped waist jeans that come in indigo and washed denim. We’ve seen them on IRL, and boy do they look fierce with a capital F. Style them up for now with the crop top above, and wear later in the year with a tied up shirt and sliders. We need them in both colours tbh.    Jeans, £25, Zendaya x Boohoo.com Be quick girls, we predict this collection is going to break the internet – mainly from LOOK HQ all filling their baskets RN. Go, go, go! It's been a tough week for the Made In Chelsea star, but she's determined to bounce back There was resounding sadness in the LOOK office last week, when Millie Mackintosh announced she would be closing her self-titled fashion range. The business, Cammac, will be liquidated after it was revealed the label owes £584K, with Millie personally losing £178K. Announcing the closure on Instagram, Millie revealed the business had struggled with the current financial climate, saying: ‘[It] has proved immensely challenging and the business is no longer sustainable.’     We imagine it’s a rather gloomy time for Millie, 28, but despite the news, a source speaking exclusively to LOOK has revealed that she’s in positive spirits, determined to focus on projects and endorsements set for the following year. She’s also getting married to former Made In Chelsea co-star Hugo Taylor, 31, and throwing herself into planning the wedding.   ‘Millie is devastated that her business has gone bust – but she allowed herself a couple of days to feel sorry for herself and is now vowing to come out fighting and get her life and career back on track,’ explains a friend. There are apparently three endorsement offers on the table for the star and last year, Millie launched her first beauty line with Boots, which is set to continue. Our insider reveals she’s been hard at work on the next range, with new products set to drop in September.   There are rumours the former reality star is liquidating the business, only to be starting another one, but LOOK can reveal this isn’t the case. ‘Millie is not about to launch a new fashion label,’ her agent told us exclusively. We think there could be a potential move into fitness this year, though. ‘Millie’s been spending lots of time in the gym, which has helped her stay in a positive and motivated head space,’ says a close pal. ‘Hugo has played a big part in lifting her spirits, too. Planning the wedding has been a great distraction and has been her salvation through all of this.’ We’re truly gutted for Millie, but we know she’ll make a brilliant comeback. In the meantime, it seems the wedding countdown is officially on… For more on Millie Mackintosh, pick up this week’s issue of LOOK. By Molly West From the editors of Woman & Home   The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge stepped out to celebrate St Patrick’s Day at the weekend, in one of the Duchess’s final engagements before she’s due to give birth. The royal couple visited the 1st Battalion of the Irish Guards in London, of which William is Colonel, on Saturday. And as ever, Catherine made sure she was dressed appropriately for the occasion.    She chose to wear a green Catherine Walker coat with a fur collar and matching cuffs, something she recycled from her recent royal tour in Sweden. To accessorise, the Duchess chose a simple pair of black heels and a Gina Foster hat, which she previously wore for St Patrick’s Day in 2014. However, it was perhaps the smallest of all her accessories that were perhaps the most significant – the stunning drop earrings she wore to complement the outfit. The £3,500 tourmaline, diamond and amethyst earrings are not only beautiful but also have a lot of meaning attached to them, as they were reportedly made to celebrate the birth of Princess Charlotte in 2015. They were designed by luxury jeweller Kiki McDonough, but it is not known who gave them to Kate. Kate Middleton’s earrings had a special significance During their visit, Catherine and William greeted 350 soldiers as well as their official mascot, Domhnall the Irish Wolfhound. Due to the difficult weather, Domhnall’s handler Aidan Cathcart was concerned he might not behave, saying: ‘He is the first guy on the parade. He’s the main guy.’ However, all seemed to go to plan and Catherine sweetly fastened a shamrock to the mascot, who she has become quite familiar with over the years of attending the parade.  The couple managed to escape the cold weather by attending the Guardsman’s Lunch, where the Duke of Cambridge happily sipped on a pint of Guinness, but heavily pregnant Catherine stuck to water. This will be one of the very last public appearances from the Duchess, as she is due to give birth to her third child in a matter of weeks. Ahead of the birth, the Royal Family has created a new webpage dedicated to the baby, which will provide updates on the birth ‘as they become available’. Sweaty Betty has amped up girl power on the high street launching a new campaign to celebrate women all year round... Last week we celebrated International Women’s Day. A day where women everywhere were celebrated: McDonald’s flipped their iconic arches  and Kim Kardashian West launched her new feminist Kimoji’s to (just a little bit of) controversy. However, along with team at Sweaty Betty thought that as 2018 already feels like the year of the woman we should continue the celebration all year long. And that is one celebration team LOOK can get behind!   It might only be March but it already feels like it’s the year of unrivalled empowerment for women. 2018 marks 100 years since women were, finally, awarded the right to vote! It would almost feel criminal if we didn’t dedicate this entire year to brave and powerful women who inspired us then and now. So for International Women’s Day and beyond Sweaty Betty have created two exclusive tees to celebrate girl power and nothing makes quite a statement like a slogan tee!   Sweaty Betty founder Tamara Hill-Norton shared that ‘we created these limited edition tees to celebrate strong and powerful women worldwide’ and with her brands mission to ’empower women through fitness and beyond’ it seemed silly to limit the support to just a single day. The launch of the tees coincides with the brands 20th birthday adding a personal element to the clothing as they are designed using the brands signature technical fabrics. With a tee emblazoned with ‘Support Women, Support The World’ and, a vest with ‘Sisterhood’ the bold slogan T-Shirts has returned with a bang. Outside the collection the LOOK office love the navy ‘woman almighty’ light knit which would be perfect with everything from yoga pants to loveworn jeans and is an oh-so easy way to show your solidarity. Shop the empowering styles below and wear yours to yoga with pride… The This Morning lady took to Instagram to share her skirt swap...  It looks like Holly Willoughby was forced to change her outfit before filming This Morning, as her skirt was deemed ‘too short’ for television. The ITV presenter has become known for sharing #OOTD posts with her Instagram followers each day, with many hanging on her every bargain buy.   (Left) Holly Willoughby’s first outfit, (Right) what she wore on air… But on Tuesday morning, her stylist Angie Smith shared a photo of ‘the one that got away’ – apparently, because it was a little too revealing for the breakfast show. Whilst we think that women should be able to wear whatever they like, many fans did point out the fact that Holly spends a lot of time sitting on the famous This Morning sofa – and we all know the struggle of continuously having to pull something down when you’re seated.     Sharing the posts on her own Instagram account, Holly captioned the ‘before’ snap: ‘#Repost @angiesmithstudio
The one that got away 😢 #TooShortForTM’. Fans have shared their thoughts in the comment section, with one writing: ‘Love it! What a shame you couldnt wear [sic]’. Another added: ‘Not too short at all it looks lovely…’ As long as Holly is comfortable and confident in her outfit of choice, that’s all that matters to us. London designed, the FARNOL collection launched online this week. With the objective to change how modern consumers think about their wardrobe and their edit of 100 items is set to change everything... Consisting of just twenty pieces each season FARNOL’s debut collection is divided equally between mens and womenswear, to allow easy styling through versatile everyday wear. If, like us, you love an everyday staple and are keen to streamline your wardrobe FARNOL’s everyday edit will tick all the boxes. Made from high quality cottons and cashmere the collection starts at £15 for classic tees going up to £120 for a lovely luxurious cashmere dress.   Founder Mitchel Farnol, and co-creator Gareth Olyott, noticed how our spending habits were ‘excessive’ as we each style we clutter our wardrobes with the seasons ‘must-haves’ before forgetting about them the following season. FARNOL’s ethos aims to eliminate this way of shopping by creating a clothing line, which can be worn throughout the seasons with its neutral colour pallet and timeless designs: ‘We’ve created a collection which travels through the different lifestyles and times of the everyday person. This is showcased in our ‘Everyday Collection’ and is channelled through our simple silhouettes, and, subtle colour palette.’ The new clothing line allows for styling to become simpler and our once cluttered wardrobe to become a sanctuary of unity as the pieces compliment each other harmoniously. Sophisticated cuts and a neutral colour pallet allows for an effortlessly chic vibe to be achieved easily.   With styles already selling out fast we thought we’d share nine styles you can shop now before it’s too late! Compiled by Daisy Stringer The fashion accessory could have been a subtle tribute to Princess Diana...  You’ve probably seen photos of Meghan Markle everywhere this morning. Why? Well, she stepped out, once again, with her fiancé Prince Harry, this time attending a special service at Westminster Abbey in celebration of Commonwealth Day. Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge were also in attendance, and it marked Meghan’s very first official engagement with the Queen.    Naturally, Meghan knocked it out of the park with her latest style offering. The former Suits actress opted for a navy dress and matching court shoes, which she teamed with a tailored Amanda Wakeley coat and a white beret. The 36-year-old is known for putting a little meaning behind her sartorial decisions, so people have been quick to draw some significance out of this #OOTD.    Her headwear was by milliner Stephen Jones, who just so happened to design berets for the late Princess Diana, according to reports. Just last year, Jones told British Vogue: ‘She really loved the world of fashion, and she liked the people in it. ‘It was an escape for her.’  This could mean that Meghan’s choice was a direct nod to her future husband’s mother, and it wouldn’t be the first time. Her engagement ring is known to include two stones that once belonged to the Princess of Wales. Others have pointed out that this simple cap has a rich – and sometimes political – history, particularly when it comes to the fight for equality. Meghan is a proud advocate for women’s rights, so could her choice of accessory have been a way for her to express her feminist beliefs? The beret is a style statement that’s gone in and out of mainstream fashion since the early 1900s, so perhaps Meghan just liked the way it looked? And, it goes without saying, it looked fabulous on her. Keep the fashion inspo coming, Markle. The ex-Made In Chelsea star revealed the news on Instagram Millie Mackintosh has announced that she’s shutting down her fashion business. The ex-Made In Chelsea star, 28, took to Instagram last night to reveal the news, with the Evening Standard reporting that it’ll be liquidated owing hundreds of thousands of pounds.   Millie launched the company – which is officially called Cammac Venture Limited –  four years ago, selling her pieces online and through ASOS. On Instagram, she detailed how it’s been a ‘top seller’, but it seems that wasn’t enough to keep it afloat.   See: Millie Mackintosh Says She’s ‘Not In A Rush’ To Marry Hugo Taylor   She explained: ‘As someone who has always been passionate about fashion, I realise I have been incredibly fortunate to have had the opportunity to build my own fashion business over the past four years. ‘So, it is with great sadness that I have had to make the very tough decision to close it. Despite our best efforts and being a top seller with a number of our stockists, the financial climate in the fashion industry has proved immensely and the business is no longer sustainable. ‘The unwavering support from friends, family, the industry and customers has made this decision even harder.   See: Apparently, Millie Mackintosh Is Helping Meghan Markle Plan Her Wedding ‘I want to take this opportunity to wholeheartedly thank everyone who has been involved, especially my immediate team whom it’s been a privilege to work with.’ Fans were quick to send their support, with messages including: ‘Awww so sorry to hear that! Well done to you for all you have achieved and who knows what is on the horizon 😘 xx,’ and: ‘How very sad. Really loved your designs. I’m sure the future is bright. ❤️ [sic].’ We have no doubt that Millie will have plenty of success with future ventures.

All rights reserved       From tragus to daith piercings - we've got all the ear piercing inspo you'll ever need  Ear piercings are having a major moment and the coolest way to work the trend is by mix and matching single studs and hoops. So the more holes you’ve got, the more effective the look. Capiche?   But there’s no need to rush off to your nearest piercing parlour in a panic; Asos’s wear-anywhere ear cuffs or Claire’s clip on hoops are a great alternative if you don’t fancy punching any more holes in your cartilage. If you are however considering another ear-embellishment then why not follow in the footsteps of the fash pack who are all getting pierced with dainty and delicate high-end jewellery. Yup, gone are the days of chunky steel hoops with a fugly ball bearing fastening, this summer is all about luxe lobes. Jewellery designer and piercer to the stars, Maria Tash, may have something to do with it. She’s pierced everyone from Beyonce to Gwyneth using her own body jewellery line, Venus. If the piercing itself didn’t hurt her celeb fans then the bill might have done; her earrings can cost anything up to the region of $23k! Ouch! For something a little more realistic check out BVLA aka Body Vision Los Angeles – a range of luxury body jewellery that’s now being used by many top piercers as their weapon of choice across a number of stores and boutiques in the UK including London’s Love Hate Social Club. These jewels will set you back about £60 but seeing as they mostly feature high quality metals, semi-precious stones and even diamonds we can kinda see why! For those of you wanting to work with what you’ve already got take a visit to Dinny Hall – here you can browse a tonne of statement studs all sold separately with mix and matching in mind.

We've hand-picked the best on the high street... Winter dresses come and go, but here at LOOK HQ we believe in looking good and feeling great whatever the season, which is why we’ve gone to the effort of finding the very best winter dresses to buy this year. Indeed, they’re comfy and cosy, but equally as chic as every other season. See: Wedding Guest Dresses: The Look Edit   When the sunny weather is well and truly gone and winter comes knocking, it’s time to rethink your key wardrobe essentials. The first step is to rethink texture; it’s now all about heavy-duty materials that will keep you warm on those cold days – go for tweed and woven fabrics, which will work just as well in your work wardrobe as it will your off-duty, and with the picks we have here, you’ll look like you just walked off the catwalk. See: The Best Winter Boots To Grab For 2017   Ribbed knits are a key trend, and what better way to wear it than working it in a midi dress style? It’s the easiest throw-on winter dress for the season – no ironing required, might we add.

As for prints, don’t ditch them – just swap them. Choose deep winter florals over bright blooms and warm tartans over colourful checks. These are your fail-safe staples that can be layered up with knits and a coat, paired with fishnets and flats for ultimate comfort.  BUY NOW  BUY NOW   BUY NOW  Do you feel that often your options for autumn and winter dresses are very party focused? We’ve found the best winter dresses that aren’t all about sequins. The greatest thing about these gorgeous day dresses, are that you’ll wear them again and again – AND you can style and layer them, so you get more outfits for your buck! What’s not to like?  BUY NOW  BUY NOW  BUY NOW   And for when the temperature really drops, you’ll need some dress-spiration for keeping warm, while still looking stylish. These cool casual winter dresses would look UH-MAZING paired with knee-high boots, chunky-knit jumpers in bright colours (we’re all obsessed with red this season) and almost floor-length, oversized wool coats. To up the cosy-factor, add a wide-brimmed wool hat and super long scarf you can wrap around.  BUY NOW   BUY NOW  What are you waiting for?

 The trainer and influencer is a bride-to-be! 👰 Happy #InternationalWomensDay! To celebrate International Women’s on 8th March we’ve pulled together a list of some of the most empowering, kick ass women/girls from the nineties and noughties. This bunch of babes inspired us when we were young and continue to do so now. GIRL POWER!   Rose, Titanic  Being forced into marriage with a dastardly beast of a man? No ta. Rose defied her mother and society by falling in love with a Jack. Yeah, the ending broke our heart BUT if Rose hadn’t taken the leap with Jack, she might never have posed naked, danced on tables and had steamy sex in a car.   Bianca, 10 Things I Hate About You  Bianca spends most of the movie willing to sell her sister (literally) for the chance to go on a date with the most popular girl in school. Until the finale when she EPICLY stands up for what she believes in. Yes, Bi. Ariel, The Little Mermaid  Ariel is an adventurer, totally unafraid of giving up everything she knows for a new life “in the sun.” She even rescues Prince Eric, turning the whole Disney tradition on its head. Mathilda, Leon  Just 12-years-old and harder than French hitman Leon, Natalie Portman’s debut role was as pint-sized badass Mathilda. Her wardrobe was also incredible.  She might have started out as a spoilt princess but Friends’ babe Rachel Green soon learned to stand on her own two feet, working up a sweat in Coffee Perk before making her own luck in the fashion world. She also always had her pals backs and taught to never accept anything other that respect, loyalty and love from boyfriends/girlfriends. Kelly Kapowski, Saved By The Bell  Who didn’t want to be Kelly when they were growing up? Her mega quiff, floral jeans and teeny crop tops used to drive geeky Zack wild. But Kelly was way too cool to care. Elle Woods, Legally Blonde  When Elle’s perfect boyfriend breaks up with her she doesn’t stew in a bucket of Haagen Dazs all night whilst sobbing over old his Instagram selfies. No, she gets into Harvard and proves anyone who ever judged or doubted her wrong. Bad. Ass. Romy & Michele’s High School Reunion  “You know what I realised? I don’t care if you don’t like us, you’re a bad person with an ugly heart.” R & M hitting their reunion in co-ordinating outfits to end up telling their old high school bullies they just don’t care anymore was a little slice of heave. Proof meanies shouldn’t be tolerated. Buffy The Vampire Slayer  Having to vanquish demons and vamps when you have homework is a drag but Buffy handled it all with sass and style. Her snappy one liners and wicked lipliner were also total #goals. Sabrina The Teenage Witch  Being a teenager in high school is tough. Even if you’re a witch with wicked powers. But Sabrina balanced life as a teen with witchy duties perfectly. She did have sassy Salem the cat to help, of course… Lauren Conrad, The Hills  When your response to the question, what’s your favourite position?” is, “CEO” it’s safe to say you’re a modern feminine icon of sorts. All hail LC. Cher Horowitz, Clueless  We’d be here days if we counted the ways we love Cher. So let’s just quote her class presentation… “In conclusion, may I please remind you that it does not say ‘RSVP’ on the Statue of Liberty.” Hear, hear. Spice Girls  It wouldn’t be a GIRL POWER appreciation list without the original purveyors. *Sigh* The ’90s. What a decade. From The Big Breakfast to Britpop and beyond, if you were lucky enough to be a ’90s teen then you knew how important it was to be rocking the latest fashions. And dude, were we spoiled for choice. In ten short years a style revolution was born, and if you were right there with us (watching Buffy whilst goofing around with your Tamagotchi) then you’ll happily admit to owning at least one, or all of the below. Have we missed anything? 1. Buffalo Shoes   The Spice Girls really started something with Buffalo. Pretty soon we were all bouncing around on sky-high sponge platform trainers thinking we looked the shizz.  The Spice Girls loved Buffalo.  2. Skirts Over Trousers   Lucky you if you were one of them girls that had an actual skant (see what we did there?) hybrid. The rest of us had to make do wearing an actual skirt over trousers…  Zoë always knew what looks worked. The girls from B*witched rocked skirts over pants…with a side of double denim.  3. Bhindis It was the small part of Gwen Stefani’s look that we could pull off at home without having to do a thousand sit-ups a night. Thanks Gwen.  Gwen Stefani ticks so many ’90s trend boxes it blows our minds. Plus Alisha’s Attic knew how to rock some bhindi action.  SEE: 15 Trends ALL 90s Girls Will Know (And Love)… 4. Backless Tops Less was definitely more in the ‘90s, and that included shameless back flashing. The more you bared, the cooler you were. Total nightmare for those of us generously blessed in the boob department.  Mel C knew how to bring some back to her ’90s look.  5. Babydoll Dresses It started with Whigfield. It ended around ‘95. The high street is now full of them again. Up the My So Called Life ante by wearing a white tee underneath.  Whigfield and the original ’90s IT girls Tara Palmer Tomkinson & Tamara Beckwith…nailing a Babydoll.  6. The Cult Street Brands Naff Naff jackets and Kickers shoes were essential fifth year fashion; if you didn’t rock at least one of the two you may as well have moved schools. SEE: 13 Toys We Totally Loved In The ’90s and ’00s 7. The Classy Brands We all aspired to wear chic French imports Morgan and Kookai (if just for the trophy plastic shopping bags) or quirky Red Or Dead. Let’s face it, there came an age where Tammy Girl just didn’t cut it anymore.  The Red Or Dead store in Covent Garden. A ’90s mecca.  8. Pedal Pushers As seen on Geri Halliwell and Denise van Outen, these babies made everyone look like a confused 1950’s teenager. Not at all flattering on the crotch area.  Geri Halliwell pretty much brought back ’90s pedal pushers all by herself.  9. Dragon & Flame Motifs Remember Natalie Imbruglia’s tee in Torn? Yeah, don’t pretend you didn’t try and hunt that one down.  Natalie Imbruglia: Beth from Neighbours cuts hair. Lisa Kudrow and Christina Ricci – sporting a rather fetching pair of flame motif/pedal pusher hybrids.  10. Butterfly Hair Clips They came in packs of twenty, but when it came to artfully twisting your hair into that signature ‘90s updo you only ever could find one. We’re still baffled twenty years on.  Zoë knew butterfly clips were the backbone of every ’90s twist n’spike updo. Jen has gone for the rope effect here…with butterflies.  11. Combat Trousers The All Saints ladies made utility pants a bona fide trend. It basically meant we all walked around with our knickers hanging out.  The girls from All Saints championed the low-slung look.  12. Satin Anything  Shiny satin dresses or maxi skirts (preferably cut on the bias) were the a-list go-to for red carpet glam. Drew Barrymore liked to accessorize hers with a crochet poncho. What a maverick. Scream queen Neve Campbell loved a bit of satin. And Drew. The words escape us.  13. Mesh Tops Anything netted or see-through meant you had major wardrobe game back in the ‘90s. Making your own out of ratty old school tights was perfectly acceptable.  Trust Mel C to work another key ’90s trend.  14. Knee High Boots A platform heel was essential, and if you had a pair in white PVC you were the actual bomb.  Patsy Palmer AKA Bianca from Eastenders. Girl had it going on.  15. Tiny Backpacks Completely impractical yet totally uh-mazing. Your choice of Disney character/sports drawstring/pastel fluffy blob (that got a bit matted) pretty much defined your teenage identity for like, all time.  Drew Barrymore once again is rocking our ’90s world.  16. Leopard Print Coats From rock stars to ladettes, a leopard print coat gave you instant pub-landlady glam.  Madonna had a moment in the ’90s. Wearing leopard print.  17. Knee High Socks *sigh* Clueless was like our ‘90s movie style bible, and whatever Cher wore, we wore…even if it looked a bit ridiculous for shopping with your dad in Halfords.  Alicia Silverstone & Shannon Doherty: Two ’90s icons in long socks.  SEE: Clueless: Team LOOK’s Top 13 Quotes Ever 18. Rave Gear Gilets, asymmetric zips, cyber punk braids, parachute pants; yep, didn’t we all flirt a bit with the rave trend? Before realizing that the outlandishly large trousers just soaked up ALL the rain. And that we looked a bit of a div…  Jacqui Blake & Zoë Ball: ready for a rave.  19. Square Sunglasses Yeah. What was with this trend? The Appleton sisters were all over it.  All Saints loved some squared off sunglasses.  20. Hanky-Hem Tops Because that cheeky little point hid the bellybutton piercing your mum forbade you to get.  Mel C makes yet another appearance on our list….  21. Retro Sportswear Damon Albarn (swoon) pretty much created the need for obscenely tight sports tees and Adidas Sambas.  Blur were the bona fide style fitties of the ’90s.  22. Bad Hats  Hands up who didn’t own, or aim to own a Kangol hat? You know who you are. Then there was the Bez bucket, and the Blossom-style velvet floppy style…pinned up at the front, and accessorized with a ridiculously large fake daisy.  90’s hats. No one was safe…  23. Stripy or Patterned Tights We bought them from shops that sold incense and wore them on mufti days with our 19 odd-hole DM boots. Cause we liked Nirvana and were ‘different’. 24. PVC Anything faux leather, preferably in some kind of silver or cosmic effect appealed to our developing cyber goth sensibility. And like rave gear (see above), it wound up just making us look a bit naff. And don’t even get us started on how difficult it was to sit on vinyl bus seats…  Denise van Outen & Emma Bunton looking tres shiny.  25. Chokers From thick velvet Victoriana style, to those weird plastic twisty things, every teenage ‘90s girl owned a choker. The cool sixth form girls rocked ones with ying yang symbols, and we coveted them from the far end of the playground.  Sadie Frost & Kelly Brooke: making the choker work for them.  26. Mohair Fuzzy mohair jumpers in a pastel shades gave us a kooky Bjork edge. They also meant we left whipsy balls of residue all over mum’s new three-piece suite.  ’90s Bjork gave us the fluffy sweater.  27. Midriff The ULTIMATE ‘90s accessory. If you weren’t baring your belly, you were basically your nan.  ’90s midriff was essential. Gwen Stefani & Nicole Appleton had it down pat.  28. A Baby-G  Prime arm candy for the technologically savvy nineties fashionista. The Baby-G had tons of functions, came in a whole rainbow of colours and if you owned one, you were pretty much winning at life – especially if it was pink. The best bit? They’re about to make a comeback – as showcased by LOOK’s Fashion News Editor Gemma – to celebrate the brands 21st birthday. Time to dig yours out, or invest in a shiny new one!  

 Margot Robbie, we bow down... The Oscars 2018 are finally upon us, and all eyes are on the red carpet to see the arrival of Hollywood’s A-list in their dazzlingly best… Taking place at the Dolby Theatre, Los Angeles, the 90th annual Academy Awards arrivals kicked off in fitting style, with all eyes on J.Law (who in true, traditional Jennifer Lawrence Oscars fashion has become a viral meme again because she’s just so damn relatable), in a dark metallic Dior gown, featuring some barely there spaghetti straps for just the right amount of of 90s nostalgia.   The Oscar winning actress kicked off the metallic trend on the red carpet, with Sandra Bullock (in Louis Vuitton), Lupita Nyong’o (in Versace) and Gal Gadot  (in Givenchy), all following suit in shimmering metallics – no doubt referencing the infamous golden statuette – with Twitter in overdrive calling Lupita an actual IRL Oscar, which tbf, is pretty accurate. Alongside metallics, the A-list went all in with the lace embellishment, full skirts and white and blush tones in a nod to bridal wear: Allison Williams (Armani Privé), Mira Sorvino, Camila Alves (Vivienne Westwood) and Margot Robbie (in an incredible Chanel Haute Couture gown) all opted for silhouettes that wouldn’t look out of place walking down the aisle. And in one epic Oscars takeover, Nicole Kidman slayed in a vivid blue Armani Privé gown with romantic oversized bow detail and proved once again, she owns the red carpet. Talking about Oscars Moments, can we all please take a second to remember this gem from last year, when Nicole Kidman taught us all how to clap…   Scroll down to see the best Oscars 2018 red carpet looks…. Margot Robbie in Chanel  Emma Stone in Louis Vuitton Jennifer Lawrence in Dior Greta Gerwig in Rodarte Gal Gadot in Givenchy  Zendaya in Giambattista Valli Nicole Kidman in Armani Privé  Emily Blunt in Alexander McQueen Jennifer Garner in Versace Camilla Alves in Vivienne Westwood Allison Williams in Armani Prive Blanca Blanco in Atria Couture Taraji P Henson in Vera Wang Saoirse Ronan in Calvin Klein Sandra Bullock in Louis Vuitton Leslie Mann in Zac Posen Salma Hayek in Gucci Laura Dern in Calvin Klein Jane Fonda in Balmain Danai Gurira in Gabriela Hearst Meryl Streep in Dior Lupita Nyongo in Versace Mary J Blige in Versace Timothee Chalamet in Berluti Viola Davis in Michael Kors Tom Holland in Hermès Whoopi Goldberg in Christian Siriano Elizabeth Moss in Dior  Daniel Kaluuya in Brunello Cucinelli  LOL, you guys...  Jennifer Lawrence was on top form at the Oscars this year. Hollywood’s elite stepped out for Sunday night’s 90th Annual Academy Awards, in a celebration of the very best in film. Of course, the A-list guests put their best foot forward on the red carpet, but J-Law’s BFF moment with fellow actress Emma Stone didn’t go unnoticed by viewers either.   Poking fun at her friend, Jennifer clearly couldn’t pass up the opportunity for some laughs when host Jimmy Kimmel made a funny about last year’s now-famous Best Picture gaffe. You may remember that La La Land was mistakenly announced as the winner. ‘This year, when you hear your name called, don’t get up right away… Give us a minute,’ he told the audience and, of course, the camera honed in on Emma’s reaction. Jennifer was also caught on film, pointing and laughing at her gal pal.     Viewers spotted the moment and wasted very little time in taking to social media to talk about it. ‘#JenniferLawrence & #EmmaStone’s friendship is already a highlight of the Oscars,’ one wrote. ‘Enjoying Jennifer Lawrence sat next to Emma Stone. Would like to be sat on that row plz,’ another added. Yup. We want in too. From the editors of Marie Claire Frances McDormand was given the gong for best actress at the Oscars, for her role in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.   The 60-year-old came out on top in a very strong category, which included Meryl Streep, Margot Robbie and Lady Bird star Saoirse Ronan. But she wasn’t about to let the moment pass without sharing it with her comrades. Taking to the stage to accept her award, McDormand made a point of giving a kickass speech. Telling the audience that she had ‘some things to say,’ Frances highlighted the need to tell more female stories.   ‘Look around, ladies and gentleman, because we all have stories to tell and projects we need financed,’ she said. ‘Don’t talk to us about it at the parties tonight. Invite us into your offices… and we’ll tell you all about them.’   ‘If I may be so honoured to have all the female nominees in every category stand with me in this room tonight,’ she said. ‘Meryl if you do it everybody else will…’ Of course, Meryl Streep obliged. She ended her impassioned moment with two words: ‘Inclusion rider.’ According to Dr. Philip Goff, President of The Center for Policing Equity, an inclusion rider is ‘a clause in an actor’s contract that requires the cast and crew be diverse in order to retain the actor.’ Talk about a stand-out moment. YASSS. By Lucy Pavia  From the editors of Marie Claire   Jennifer Lawrence was on vintage Jennifer Lawrence form at the Oscars on Sunday night. She tipped up to the ceremony, jazz-handed her way across the red carpet, grabbed a glass of white wine, accidentally ended up in the wrong row and hitched up her gold Dior dress to climb over the furniture.     The Academy Awards are, of course, always better with a splash of Jennifer Lawrence silliness. She became everyone’s overnight favourite in 2013 when she tripped on the stairs in her Dior gown on the way to collect the statuette for Best Actress, then did a shot to celebrate her win / recover from the embarrassment. Discover & share this Jennifer Lawrence GIF with everyone you know. GIPHY is how you search, share, discover, and create GIFs.  ‘You guys are just standing up because you feel bad that I fell and that’s really embarrassing, but thank you’ she said.  The following year she tripped over in (admittedly enormous) heels and a red column dress on the Oscars red carpet, rescued by then-boyfriend Nicholas Hoult.  But the years since have been disappointingly fallow in terms of Lawrence-related slapstick, so we were delighted to see her back on form this year.

We're expecting even BIGGER things this year The Oscars 2018 are nearly here, and while we’re obviously super excited to see who will take home the awards, we’re secretly even MORE looking forward to seeing what the world’s biggest A-listers will wear for the event. When it comes to designers, everyone from Armani and Dior to Gucci and Louis Vuitton has been called upon by the stars to dress them for the renowned Oscars red carpet. Chanel, Marc Jacobs and Givenchy are never far behind either, and this time, we’re expecting our stars to pull out ALL the big guns. Naturally, there’s always a fair few celebs who really get into the spirit of the occasion and go for an Oscars gold dress – because if you’re not gonna win a statue, you might as well dress like one.   Ahead of this year’s awards ceremony then, we’ve put together a compilation of the very best Oscars dresses that have ever graced the event. We’re talking Cher’s near-naked dress back in 1992, Celine Dion’s backwards satin tuxedo get-up she sported at the 1999 awards and that Helena Bonham Carter Union Jack garter in 2011. We’re not kidding. So without further ado, sit back, relax and prepare to be taken on an Oscars dress journey that’ll have you gawping, gagging and in fits of laughter (not necessarily in that order)… From the editors of Marie Claire The Duchess of Cambridge is at her busiest – navigating a calendar of official royal engagements and helping Meghan and Prince Harry plan their Windsor Castle wedding. Not to mention balancing motherhood duties, looking after Prince George, Princess Charlotte and preparing for baby number three.   This week looks like one of her busiest yet, with the 36-year-old royal even going to consecutive events on Wednesday – something she has been heavily praised for.  Kate Middleton came under fire, however, for her wardrobe choices, with fans and followers deeming that her outfit on Wednesday wasn’t weather appropriate.   Braving the freezing temperatures, Kate walked to the National Portrait Gallery from her taxi without a coat – and while it was a short walk, fans were worried for the pregnant mother’s wellbeing. It has been thought however that it could have been down to royal protocol, with it recently announced that we would never see Kate Middleton remove her coat. ‘This evening The Duchess of Cambridge visited NPGLondon where she unveiled her Patron’s Trail of the exhibition: ‘Victorian Giants: The Birth of Art Photography’, Kensington Palace announced in a statement, with a photo of the Duchess in her Orla Kiely x Leith Clark floral dress, teamed with a pair of nude pumps and a clutch. This was Kate’s second official event of the day, with the 36-year-old already appearing at the Royal Foundation Forum with Prince Harry, Prince William and Meghan Markle, going for a different look in a royal blue tailored maternity dress by Séraphine. Stay warm, Kate! It's giving us major Calvin Klein vibes Words by Megan C. Hills While the Winter Olympics may have ended and left a figure-skating shaped hole in our hearts, ITV’s Dancing on Ice and Holly Willoughby’s fierce outfits have helped us through this difficult time. However, there’s one dress that’s come out on top with a whopping internet fan following.   Please, direct your attention to Exhibit A below: Matt Frost/ITV/REX/Shutterstock This bespoke tailored Sassi Holford dress ters a total winner, racking up over 437,000 likes on Instagram since it was posted a few weeks ago. Holly stunned the crowd in the minimal yet utterly figure flattering creation on the fourth episode of Dancing on Ice, pairing the look with Yeprem earrings.     It’s a vastly warmer reception from the other dresses that Holly wore on the show (which isn’t to say the rest of them weren’t gorgeous!). Holly’s been wearing quite a bit of Basil Soda recently and a sheer fuschia gown racked up just 130,600 Instagram likes, while another black studded dress by the brand garnered a more generous 144,471 likes.     White seems to be Holly’s winning colour however, as we’re expecting her latest Halfpenny London look to leave her other glamorous #OOTDs in the dust. Matt Frost/ITV/REX/Shutterstock Holly showed off her toned arms in the brand’s ivory Andrea corset, however it was her super dramatic frilled Riri skirt that had everybody talking. Instagram immediately exploded after she posted a picture in it. The photo has only been up for two days and over 275,770 users have already liked it, blowing some of her other dress looks out of the water.   It makes total sense that she wore the romantic dress for Fairytale week, as she looks nothing short of a princess in it. The next episode of Dancing on Ice airs this Sunday at 6pm on ITV and we can’t wait to see what Holly’s going to be wearing next. By Alexandra Whittaker From the editors of InStyle US   Just call Kate Middleton the queen of fashion consistency, because this royal knows what she likes and sticks to it. The soon-to-be mum of three visited the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists in order to learn about the launch of the Nursing Now campaign, and while she was out, she dressed in some of her all-time favorite fashion pieces. Middleton looked regal while dressed in head-to-toe royal blue – by way of a Jenny Packham coat and dress set – but even her accessories stood out. Instead of keeping things minimal, she opted for Jimmy Choo navy suede shoes, a large blue-violet G. Collins & Sons tanzanite pendant necklace, and matching earrings that complemented her very famous sapphire engagement ring.    It’s no secret that Middleton went against the conventional grain with her blue ring. Middleton’s engagement ring is a 12-carat sapphire-and-diamond cluster ring worth about $500,000. It’s special for much more than its price tag, though. The ring was originally bought by William’s dad Prince Charles to give to Princess Diana for their engagement, and it was reportedly modeled, in part, after a blue Garrad brooch of Queen Victoria’s that Queen Elizabeth enjoys wearing occasionally. ‘It was said to be a strong influence on Prince Charles when he came to Garrard to purchase a ring for Lady Diana. He actually ended up setting a sapphire cluster ring for her, which was later given by Prince William to the Duchess of Cambridge on their engagement,’ said Garrad’s creative director Sara Prentice to Vogue. ‘I would imagine growing up being surrounded by your mother and your grandmother [with] such beautiful, incredible jewellery … it would stick with you.’  Middleton’s Tuesday morning bling matched her ring seamlessly. She has worn the blue jewels before, and only a few weeks back, and they’re a closet staple of hers since they’re so special. The main jewel is surrounded by 0.97-carat diamonds and set in platinum, and it’s from a brand that is special to the royal family. The G. Collins and Sons jewelry firm in England has provided the jeweler appointed as royal Crown Jeweller by the British monarchs for years. Queen Elizabeth II appointed G. Collins and Sons’s Harry Collins as her personal jeweler in 2000, and he went on to be the Crown Jeweller in 2007. ‘This is the greatest of honors that can be bestowed upon a jeweler by Her Majesty the Queen, involving the care and maintenance of the Crown Jewels housed in the Tower of London and other related duties,’ Collins said of the appointment in a statement. Quick, get in the car - we're going shopping. Words by Megan C. Hills Stacey Solomon has long been a massive fan of the high street and a woman after our own heart (and budget). Her latest outfit post on Instagram has been a massive hit, channeling a springtime feeling we really need this snowy Monday, and all eyes have been on her must-have accessory – a £12 Primark backpack.   In a dreamy photo posted to her social media account yesterday, Stacey posed with the fluffy pink bag against a rose-strewn floral wall. Whether it was fate or the Loose Women presenter had gone the extra mile for the photograph, she was definitely going for a blush pink theme with the backdrop and her fuzzy winter coat channelling the same shade. She captioned the post, ‘When you chose your outfit to match the wall… HAPPY SUNDAY’.     Naturally, it was accompanied by nearly every flower emoji available. Since the post went up, over 11,000 people have since liked the image and the bag seems to be a total winner. Many of her commenters have been gushing about the feathery accessory, with users flooding the comments asking the former X Factor contestant for outfit details and gushing over how adorable it is.  More details here This isn’t the first time that Stacey’s Primark high street bargains have captured the hearts of the fashion-savvy and she donned an adorable bee-embroidered tee, as well as a Parisian-inspired striped top from the brand all in the past month.     Everybody loves a style steal – even the celebs. Here’s to making every penny count. Meghan Markle has already proven that she’s not afraid to do her own thing. She might have a royal rock on her finger, but the 36-year-old has been making headlines for her more laid back approach to official engagements; opting for a relaxed messy bun over a polished ‘do and also favouring smart trousers over day dresses.    And it seems that she’s making an impression, as global fashion search platform Lyst reported a spike in searches for ‘wide leg black trousers’ following both Meghan’s visit to Edinburgh and her appearance in Brixton in January. Whilst searches for ‘black trousers’ are up 19% year-on-year, experts reportedly say that their rising popularity coincide with the increasing profile of Prince Harry’s beau in the run-up to their May wedding.    It’s not only the world of fashion that’s seeing Meghan’s influence. We were already copying her make-up, and now it seems cosmetic surgeons are dealing with a number of Meghan-inspired requests.  Dr. Nick Milojevic – owner and clinical director of Milo Clinic – says that the Kylie Jenner lip trend is officially over, thanks to Ms. Markle. ‘Meghan has fantastic lips, they are natural yet full. 2018 will definitely see a more natural lip that aligns with the other features of the face and not over dominate the face.’ With the Royal Wedding getting closer and closer, we only see the nation’s obsession getting stronger… Turns out, East Midlanders are all about splashing the cash... We’ve all heard the three-month salary rule when it comes to buying engagement rings, but it seems it may no longer be relevant. According to a new study by Ripe Insurance, the average person is now splashing out just 1.7 months’ salary on their partner’s rock – and one in three admit to spending £250 or less.   However, they’ll generally still set you back thousands. Since 2010, the average jewel has cost £2,014.75, with prices varying across the country. Want to know how much people are paying in your area? Here goes… £2,451.92 £2,401.88   £2,283.48 £2,046.88 £1,951.09 £1,761.36 £1,760.42 £1,703.70 £1,620.54 £1,434.21 £1,336.54 £1,062.50 Interestingly, 69% of engagement rings are now chosen as a couple or by the person being proposed to. In fact, only 31% of people feel confident to choose their future husband or wife’s band. It seems mum still know best, with more than 1/10 of proposers turn to their mothers for advice on picking the perfect piece before any other family or friend. Over half (52%) of proposals involve no engagement ring at all. However, women who propose are more likely to be prepared beforehand (47%) than men (42%). A rising trend over the past decade has been the use of placeholder rings. Before the year 2000, only 1% of proposals involved one, but this has since increased to 7%. Would you care how much your partner spent on an engagement ring? Let us know on Twitter @lookmagazine. The 36-year-old's original cross-body number is sold out, but we know where you can nab a very close copy... By Amy Hunt From the editors of Woman & Home   Meghan Markle wowed the nation yet again when she visited Scotland for the very first time on 13 February. Alongside Prince Harry, Meghan greeted crowds at Edinburgh Cathedral and visited Social Bite, a local sandwich shop that helps the homeless. But it was Meghan’s stunning outfit that caused the biggest stir during her fifth royal engagement.    The royal-to-be channelled Scottish fashion in a long tartan Burberry coat, but kept the rest of her outfit simple. She finished off the look with a black Wolford jumper and black Veronica Beard floor-length trousers. However, it was Meghan’s accompanying choice of handbag that really caught the attention of fashion fans. For the trip, Meghan chose a bottle green cross-body bag by Scottish designers Strathberry. And the Meghan effect appeared to be in full force during the trip, as the £425 bag sold out within minutes of the actress appearing in it. But it’s not the first time Meghan has chosen a Strathberry design. For her very first royal engagement in Nottingham, she decided on their Strawberry Midi Tote, which also proved a popular choice. Speaking about the attention they’ve got since Meghan appeared with their designs, a Strathberry spokesperson said they were ‘thrilled’. Meghan Markle wore a Strathberry bag with her tartan coat ‘It is such an honour to see Meghan carrying a Strathberry bag again; this time an East/West Mini in Bottle Green. ‘We are especially thrilled that Meghan is carrying Strathberry in our home city and also after she chose to carry her Strathberry Midi Tote for her first royal engagement back in December. We wish them the very best for their upcoming nuptials.’ In fact, Meghan broke with royal convention in choosing the £425 bag. Proving she’s happy to bend the fashion rules slightly, she yesterday became the first member of the family to choose a cross-body option for an engagement. If you were hoping to emulate Meghan’s look for yourself and have been left disappointed at the bag selling out, never fear, as there are a few excellent look-a-likes available. If you can afford a slightly pricier option, this choice from & Other Stories is an excellent copy – with a similar dark green colour and gold strap. At £79, it is more of an investment piece, but would undoubtedly look stylish with any outfit.  Buy now A less expensive option from one of our favourite retailers is this Marks & Spencer faux leather shoulder bag. While it’s a lighter green than Meghan’s handbag, it’s equally as fashionable. And it will certainly add a sharp touch to any look.  Buy now And finally, if it’s a super-affordable option you’re after, look no further than Dorothy Perkins. The retailer has a fabulous copy of Meghan’s Strathberry bag, with a subtle and sophisticated design. Dorothy Perkins’ option also includes a gold chain. And at £14.50, how could you say no to this cross-body bag?  Buy now Will you be buying any of these look-a-likes? You’ll be emulating Meghan’s effortless style in no time… We’ve said it before, and we’ll say it again; Holly Willoughby has become a firm-favourite of ours when it comes to a red carpet. The much-loved This Morning lady has been causing concern this week, having told fans – whilst on air – that she was feeling under the weather.   But, we’re pleased to say, that hasn’t stopped her from bringing her A-game for this year’s BRIT Awards.  Looking as glamorous as ever, the mum-of-three absolutely dazzled in a white tuxedo-style dress.   The plunging LWD, from David Koma’s Resort collection, featured a feathered hemline and black hardware, which she coordinated with some barely-there heels.   It’s fair to say that Holly and her co-host Phillip Schofield were amongst the most well-received on the BRITs red carpet, with screaming fans chanting their names as they entered the glitzy event at London’s O2. Many were left concerned after today’s earlier episode of This Morning, when Holly explained that she was having a hard time hearing due to her cold. Well, we’re pleased that she made it onto the BRITs red carpet… It's all about showing solidarity with the #TimesUp movement The BRIT Awards red carpet is getting busy. Stars have been arriving at the ceremony at London’s O2 Arena since earlier this evening, being greeted by hosts Professor Green and Maya Jama.   Everyone’s looking stunning (how gorge is Maya’s glittery blazer dress?!), having stepped out in their finest awards show garb.  But fans have noticed something pretty interesting about some of the guests’ choice of accessory. Ladies including Paloma Faith, Caroline Flack, Ellie Goulding and Dua Lipa are carrying white roses, while Ed Sheeran and Phillip Schofield have them pinned to their lapels.   Why’s this? Well, something similar happened at last month’s Grammys, and it’s all about showing solidarity for the ongoing #TimesUp movement against sexual harassment and inequality in the entertainment industry.  You’ll know that celebrities wore black at the BAFTAs and Golden Globes in support of the movement, and this is the same principle. It’s been reported that attendees will also be given a white rose badge – one of which Pro is sporting – in the latest of a series of protests since the Harvey Weinstein scandal rocked Hollywood last year. We’ll be keeping our eyes peeled for more white roses as the night continues. London Fashion Week is always eventful; from the shows and the FROWS to the amazing designer line-up, it’s always a fashion extravaganza. But one of the things we always look forward to is the street style. London is known for its eclectic sense of style, and from the bloggers to the vloggers, there’s always a new ‘it’ girl waiting to take the Best Dressed crown. Obviously, London Fashion Week wouldn’t be the same without some of our favourite trendsetters. From Alexa Chung to Laura Whitmore and Millie Mackintosh, our fave Brit girls never fail to bring their style A-game to the FROW. But it’s not just the celebs giving good outfit; there’s an army of well dressed ladies hanging outside the shows just waiting to be photographed.

This will be the final collection from the collaboration, featuring 13 pieces to suit every shape and style, but it’s the prices that have got us all excited. We’ve always wanted to own something designer, but this lot starts from just £25. Yep, really. The Holly Fulton x River Island collaboration only landed on February 16th, but since then, a whole load of our fave street stylers have snapped up their fave pieces and took to Instagram to share the looks under the hashtag #fultonfever.   SEE: What To Buy From River Island Right Now Pop singer Whinnie Williams AKA Sunday Girl rocked the Holly Fulton x River Island green trench coat with embellished mini skirt, floral bag and white shirt at London Fashion Week.     TV presenter, actress, model and DJ Zara Martin, meanwhile, rocked button front wide leg trousers, sequin bodysuit and embellished court shoes.   Influencer @tostos_ also chose the same sequined bodysuit and amped up the glam with equally jazzy earrings.   Model Grace McGovern went for the lilac and pink embellished dress.   And blogger @Cocobeautea went for a more casual look with printed trousers, black cami and cosy cardigan.   To round things up then, the Holly Fulton x River Island collection has something to suit everyone, from casual trousers and tops, to going out dresses and shoes. Our fave piece from the edit? The lilac boucle mini skirt – we’ll be wearing ours with the £25 t-shirt and Converse on the weekend, before switching for a lace blouse and court shoes for dinner and drinks. Round of applause, River Island. This week the London Fashion Week street stylers had their coat game on POINT. Everyone looked much more grown-up this season, with many opting for tailored designs over the brightly coloured puffa styles that were hugely popular last season. And in particular there were three coat trends fashion editors just couldn’t get enough of; checked, lilac and the classic trench. No longer reserved for geography teachers or your grandpa’s old cap, the Prince of Wales check has firmly cemented itself as the need-to-know print. Whether you choose an oversized boyfriend coat or an long-line fitted style – you’ll instantly look on trend and polished. Try clashing your checks or wearing over denim for maximum sartorial points. Guaranteed to last for seasons to come, you’ll never tire of it; that’s a Look guarantee.            You’ve probably heard by now that lilac is the colour of the season.  Yup, the easiest way to update your trans-seasonal wardrobe – while remaining dry and warm in the typical British weather obvs – into spring is with a new coat. In particular, a lilac coat. The colour elevates any outfit, even the most basic straight leg jeans and cashmere knit. Simply throw on a lilac coat and your look is instantly Spring Summer ’18. Or why not try styling yours with metallic accessories for instant #OOTD kudos?      Trench coats have long been the style set’s best-kept secret for looking flawless AF.

When some of the film industry’s most talented descended on the Royal Albert Hall on Sunday night to honour their best and brightest, they did it in all black. Not only was this a powerful statement and nod to the Time’s Up movement, it was chic as hell. See: Why Stars Are Wearing Black To The BAFTAs   Aside from Catherine Duchess of Cambridge, who wasn’t able to partake in the night’s unofficial dress code due to royal restrictions, the stars channeled their LBD A-game. From voluminous skirts a la Lily James, who brought the drama in Burberry black tulle, to the intricate detailing on first-time nominee Margot Robbie’s Givenchy gown, attendees found endless ways to add glamour. See: Why We’re Talking About What Kate Middleton Wore To The BAFTAs We saw style savvy women like Letitia Wright, Lupita Nyong’o, and Kate Mara all opt for dresses with gold embroidery and embellishments, from bedazzeled belts to delicate patterns of thread.   Actresses like Allison Janney and Emma Roberts decided on sculptural oversized silhouettes and both looked stunning in strong necklines and shoulder pads. Lest you think we forgot red-carpet queen (and your dream celeb BFF) JLaw, she did Dior proud in a classic old Hollywood look and a gorgeous red lip in what had to be one of our favourite looks of the night. The 2018 BAFTAs are clearly off to a super stylish start, packed with glamorous gowns, flawless beauty looks and the most handsome men in suits. All that’s left? To see who takes home the top honours once the ceremony begins!     By Lucy Pavia  From the editors of Marie Claire    Prince William and Kate Middleton arrived on the BAFTAs red carpet tonight to attend the ceremony and champion William’s role as president of the Academy. Walking the red carpet at the Royal Albert Hall with BAFTA CEO Amanda Berry – guests of honour always arrive last – William wore black tie, Kate wore a long, dark green empire line dress by British designer Jenny Packham.    Kate’s choice of dark green stood out in tonight’s sea of black outfits, as actresses ranging from Jennifer Lawrence to Octavia Spencer picked an all-black or monochrome look to highlight the ongoing #TimesUp movement against sexual harassment and inequality in the entertainment industry, a movement kickstarted at the Golden Globes in early January. There had been speculation as to whether Kate Middleton would opt for black given the scale and momentum of the #TimesUp movement (despite a few Golden Globes attendees opting out for their own personal reasons), but in the end she opted out.  Why? Though the Duchess of Cambridge might privately support #TimesUp, as a member of the royal family, and therefore a figurehead of the British government, she must maintain a neutral stance about any political cause or movement.   That said, the Queen did wear a suspiciously pro-EU hat to open parliament last year (is she secretly horrified about Brexit and thought f*** it I’m 90 and I’ll do what I like? Who knows). But one detail of Kate Middleton’s BAFTA outfit did appear to nod to the movement: her Jenny Packham dress was cut with a thin black velvet ribbon just below the bust. Though whether this is just the dress or a gesture of a solidarity will remain unclear. Of course – as is the case with virtually every outfit scenario – things were a little more straightforward for Prince William, who tipped up in the universal men’s uniform of classic black tie.   It's a first for the brand Everyone loves Marks & Spencer. Its PJS, its undies, its bags- everything. And just when we thought it couldn’t get any better, the brand has launched its very first full plus-size collection, ‘Curve’. Yep, the label does already offer styles up to size 22, but this is the first collection specifically designed for sizes 18-32, and we mean it when we say it’s the best curve collection ever. We’re talking 100 pieces suitable for all shapes and occasions. The landing comes since the brains behind the brand identified a gap in the market after talking to 2000 customers who expressed an interest in a bespoke plus-size collection. The whole lot will be available both online and in 30 stores across the UK. You won’t even need to part with too much cash since the cheapest thing comes in at just £7.50.   SEE: A Love Letter To Marks & Spencer’s £25 Jeans   As if we needed any more reason to love it, Look Influencer Danielle Vanier even teamed up with Marks & Sparks to consult on the collection and design two black dresses that will be available exclusively online and at the M&S Marble Arch flagship store in London.   “For me, a little black dress is a must have for any woman,” she says. “I have taken a few elements of what I loved about this piece and created two new dresses for the collection. I have added some subtle sports details, like hard-wear on the waist and mesh layering for a contemporary feel; so both can be styled in really different ways.” Indeed, the entire collection has endless styling potential. We predict a sell-out. By Alexandra Whittaker From the editors of InStyle US   When a country shows you love, you show it right back. At least that seems to be Meghan Markle’s fashion travel philosophy. Meghan stepped out on Tuesday with her fiancé, Prince Harry, for an official royal visit to Scotland to see Edinburgh Castle, and she more than dressed for the part. The royal-to-be wore a navy, black, and green tartan button-up £1995 Burberry coat, with the plaid print looking quintessentially Scottish.    The wool coat’s pattern is famously associated with Scotland, and, when paired with Veronica Beard black trousers and her green Strathberry cross body bag (an Edinburgh-based company, no less), it only made the classic check more appropriate. Meanwhile, Prince Harry kept things simple in a dark grey coat of his own over a white shirt and navy sweater. There are only a few months to go before Meghan walks down the aisle to marry Harry, so it’s no surprise that she’s taking her royal dressing seriously. In fact, on this particular visit, she seemed to channel royals of the past and present through the print she wore. Kate Middleton wore a similar coat in 2012 Her long jacket is reminiscent of a similarly bold tartan look that Kate Middleton once wore in 2012. It also harks back to when Princess Diana chose a dark green oversized print coat on a trip to Venice in 1985. Princess Diana also wore a tartan coat With less than 100 days until she becomes a royal herself, it’s really no surprise, is it? If you've been scared to rock leggings before now, these might change everything for you...  Hello my name’s Laura and I have a big butt. Now I’d like to kick things off by saying that I am certainly not complaining. I happen to love the jelly that nature gave me. But when it comes to clothes shopping, it can definitely pose a few problems.     I’ve previously documented my hunt for the perfect pair of jeans – Topshop’s Joni, FYI – but there was one other item of clothing that I’d pretty much given up on being able to wear. As any of my curvy sisters will be able to attest, standard leggings have a tendency to go see-through.   I, unfortunately, happened to discover this whilst working behind a bar as a teen; after spending my entire shift bending over to get drinks from the beer fridge, I couldn’t figure out why I was getting so many strange looks and sniggers from the punters. It was only when I recreated the move in front of a mirror that I discovered that EVERYTHING was on display. I hung up my leggings for good after that.   That was, until I came into contact with SPANX high-rise leggings. After catching wind of a design that boasted the ability to ‘slim, flatten and smooth’  whilst being a ‘more secure and structured fit than your standard styles’, I had to give them a go. I didn’t want to hide my shape. But I hoped that these ‘figure flattering’ trous would cope with my curves without the dreaded overstretch. An ever-so-flattering office snap of my SPANX leggings in action… I’ll rarely wear a pair of bottoms that aren’t high-waisted, so the fact that these babies came with an elasticated panel that reached well above my belly button – whilst cinching in my waist – was a big win. The best part? The material on these bad boys is showing no sign of thinning down – yup, no underwear mishaps to see here. At £89 a pop, they’re not cheap. But they’re so worth it. By Olivia Bahou From the editors of InStyle US   Like at this year’s Golden Globes, actresses will wear black to the 2018 BAFTAs to support the Time’s Up movement and protest sexual harassment in Hollywood and beyond. For many stars, the choice to wear black is an easy one. But for Kate Middleton, it’s not so straightforward. While the BAFTA organisation itself has not put forward a dress code, WWD reports that British film industry leaders are banding together to show support the Time’s Up and #MeToo movements by making a red carpet statement. Several female nominees and guest reportedly plan to wear black in solidarity with the movements and the Golden Globe attendees. While there’s no word yet on who will participate, Margot Robbie, Annette Bening, Saoirse Ronan, Allison Janney, and Octavia Spencer are some of the talented actresses who are nominated and expected to attend. If it’s anything like the Golden Globes, it will be rare to see a woman not wearing black on the red carpet.   Kate Middleton wore an embellished black dress to last year’s BAFTAs The Duchess of Cambridge, who plans to attend the BAFTAs on 18th February with her husband Prince William, could face repercussions if she joins the sea of black on the red carpet – and criticism if she’s one of the few in colour. If the Duchess chooses to support Time’s Up with her wardrobe, she’ll be breaking royal protocol by making what could be construed as a political statement, something that is against the Royal Family’s rules. If she chooses not to wear black and become one of the few women wearing colour on the red carpet, Kate may face criticism for not using her platform to take a stand against sexual assault and harassment. And since her official duties involve advocating for charitable causes – from mental health awareness to pediatric cancer research – some may interpret the move as an indication that she doesn’t deem the movement as worthy enough to support. So what’s a girl to do? Perhaps she’ll choose a gown similar to last year’s Alexander McQueen number, with a black background and some sort of print and embellishment, toeing the line between the two causes. After all, some of the most steadfast supporters of Time’s Up wore bedazzled gowns to the Golden Globes that weren’t entirely black, but a pop of pattern could help Middleton make the argument to Buckingham Palace that her dress wasn’t a political statement. We’ll be watching the BAFTAs red carpet on 18th February to see what Kate decides. Mother’s Day is fast approaching, but you knew that right? If not- don’t fret!

We promise you will fall in love with at least one of our gifts!   Compiled by Lauren Cunningham Now we think about it, we've never spotted her do it either... From the editors of Marie Claire UK It’s a truth universally acknowledged that the Duchess of Cambridge always wears smart and chic outerwear.   Most recently she wore this £220 red coat by Boden, a checked Zara number and has recycled one of her favourite coats from her second pregnancy ahead of having baby number three. Naturally any coat she’s seen in sells out in a matter of hours, nay, minutes, affectionately known as ‘the Kate Middleton effect’. But, style icon status aside, have you ever seen her take any of these coats off? Neither have we – and after some digging, it turns out there’s some solid reasoning behind this choice.    It’s been reported that the reason Kate Middleton won’t take her (fabulous) coat off during an event is that it’s deemed an ‘unladylike’ thing to do. And as the duchess has to be the poster lady for poise and elegance at all times, it makes sense that she’s sticking to such protocol. Props to Kate for powering through even if a venue is boiling hot – especially during pregnancy.

 The trainer and influencer is a bride-to-be! 👰 Promotional feature with F&F Beautiful, well-fitting underwear for a supermarket price point? We’re listening… When it comes to buying underwear, women are often caught between two extremes.   We’re either shopping solid, comfortable underwear (sans sexy points), or opting for fancier occasion pieces to help boost our body confidence once that special day rolls around. But hands up, how many of us are the kind of girls that wear matching bra and pants every day? Answer: very few – which is why F&F’s gorgeous new lingerie collection is here to promise us a good underwear day, every day.    Tapping into all the latest trends, F&F’s range of luxury basics are all beautifully designed and boast a comfortable fit, helping to elevate our #underweargoals and start our day right. From stylish lace bralets to luxe loungewear, no-show t-shirt bras to comfortably classic shapes, this collection has everything the modern woman needs to feel great about her lingerie drawer, all week long. We’re loving statement essentials such as the Perfect Lace multi-way bra; sculpted and sleek in timeless navy blue, this fab must-have will look gorgeous underneath your favourite white shirt/denim combo. Or why not up your bedtime style game with gorgeous satin cami and French knicker sets, all created to make you feel super glamorous – even if you are hitting up Netflix or getting an early night.  Think standardised fits across the collection in a range of sizes, plus elements such as non-wired, seam-free and soft-touch cotton finishes for maximum support and comfort. And with bras starting from just £12, you can feel rest assured that this slice of daily lingerie luxury absolutely won’t break the bank. Make every day a good underwear day. Browse the collection online at Tesco.com or pop into your nearest Tesco store for more inspo. We've wanted this for a long, long time We don’t know about you, but we’ve been obsessed with Topshop jeans for pretty much half our lives. We love their versatility, with shapes ranging from the super-skinny Joni to the 90s-inspired Mom and the classic Straight. And with prices starting at £36, they’re fairly affordable.   But while there’s generally a cut for everyone, that doesn’t always mean they always fit perfectly.   Y’know the story. You’re in the changing room, trying to force the button on the waistband (while vowing to do 100 squats as soon as you’re home). Then you think ‘Screw it, I’m buying a Mars bar and getting the next size up’… and end up having to add a belt to your basket to make sure they don’t constantly fall down.   Oh. And let’s not even talk about saggy bum syndrome. Grim. See: What Happened When We Tried On Topshop’s Jeans IRL   But now Toppers may have solved our problems forever, by introducing half sizes. The change comes as part of the high street retailer’s new Denim Campaign. According to their website, the half-sizes are available in sizes W25, W27, W29 and W31, and for the styles Jamie, Joni, Mom, Straight, Jamie Flare and Crop. They’ll be offered in two washes, blue or black. And you don’t need to wait – the in-between sizes are already on sale online and in stores. Here are some of our favourites…  Buy now  Buy now  Buy now Once you’ve tried them, we’d love to know your thoughts @lookmagazine. EVERYONE is doing it Bathleisure is officially a thing. If you have an Instagram account, you’ll know what we mean- it’s the new trend sweeping social media, whereby people are sharing selfies wearing nothing but a head towel and/or bathrobes. Yes, really. The bathleisure idea of wearing a towel on your head first became a thing when Rita Ora wore one complete with bathrobe, diamond necklace and a full face of make-up to the EMAs. Since then, everyone who is anyone took the opportunity to jump on board and share their very own towel selfies. Thus, #Bathleisure was born.   Here’s the deal: as opposed to the sloth-like state that usually comes post-bath, people are giving the towel-robe a whole new lease of life and teaming it with make-up and/or jewellery to create a ‘lady of leisure’ look- one that says ‘I’m so fancy, I don’t even need to get dressed’. Bizarre, we know. Bella Hadid’s doing it.     Street style star @manrepeller is even doing it.   SEE: This Weird Instagram Trend Involves McDonalds Some are taking the trend a step further and posing IN the bath.   Others are taking it less seriously.   And some are going for French girl vibes avec un croissant.   As crazy as it looks, we can’t help but like the idea of lying about in our towel for hours on end without any judgement at all. We may never have to style our hair again, never have the struggle of straightening our locks, never have to fork out for a blow dry. Like seriously, it would be stupid not to take advantage of such a trend, wouldn’t it? Yes, really.  Polka dots are having a major moment this spring.  From spots sashaying down the catwalks of Dior, Valentino and Balenciaga to the street style set putting their own sartorial spin on this classic print, it’s safe to say the ubiquitous dot is making a thoroughly modern mark.
   But how do you add playful polka dots into your real life wardrobe without looking like a) an eight year old, b) Vivian à la Pretty Woman or c) an extra from 101 Dalmatians? Whether you opt for supersize spots or small specks in a monochrome palette – with so much choice on the high-street this week you’ll go dotty with choice! If you’re looking for a dress that will last for seasons to come then this one’s for you. A classic wardrobe icon, the polka-dot dress can work for any occasion from off-duty shopping trips to meetings at the office, even into wedding season. It’s that versatile.   Style this Primark number – which is only £13 FYI – over skinny jeans and a roll neck now then with high-tops and a straw hat come summer.  Dress, £13, Primark Take note from fashion blogger Lucy Williams and team this H&M dress with red boots and layered gold jewellery or style this monochrome dress from Coast with white patent heels for summer weddings.    Dress, £39.99, H&M    Dress, £99, Coast     While we guarantee this Marks & Spencer number will be your ultimate summer go-to. Wear with tan sandals for effortless holiday style. Dress, £45, Marks & Spencer       If head-to-toe spots don’t float your boat then look out for polka-dot tops. Style with jeans and ankle boots now and then swap for espadrilles come holiday season. It’s your fast track to a French wardrobe – voila!    Top, £29, Topshop  Top, £19.99, New Look  Top, £25.99, Zara      SEE: Look’s Top 23 Fashion Blogs  Style with an oversized chunky knit now and then a simple white or grey marl tee when the weather warms up.    Skirt, £50, Topshop   We can’t stop thinking about this could-be-Ganni wrap skirt from H&M. Due to drop in late February – keep your eyes peeled as we reck it’s going to sell out faster than that Balmain collection.  Skirt, £24.99, H&M   Tick off two trends in one with these kitten heels from Miss Selfridge. Wear with skinnies and a cable knit jumper for an instant wardrobe update.  Kitten Heels, £35, Miss Selfridge     To recap, polka-dots are not only our go-to print this season but they’re so easy to introduce into your current wardrobe. Ready, steady, SHOP! Here's how to get the effortless Scandi style we've all longed for... We’re always on the look out for new style inspo, and while we know Scandinavia is the go-to for sleek homeware, snowy climates and effortlessly chic fashion, we didn’t realise Oslo in Norway would become our new no.1 style destination. Until we visited the capital, that is. We associate fashion month with the 4 hotspots of New York, London, Milan and Paris but Scandinavian Fashion Week has caught our attention this season, and these are the 3 new locations you need to know.   Stockholm – 21-23rd January Oslo  – 24-28th January Copenhagen– 30th January-1st February   (SS19 dates to be announced later in the year) Oslo Runway was the one we were luckily enough to attend this season, and although we’re desperately waiting for spring to arrive, seeing AW18 shows gave us all the inspiration we need right now while it’s still chilly. These are the key trends you can actually get your hands on already. Yep, we’re no stranger to the Prince of Wales being part of our everyday outfits, or the heritage checks being at the forefront of our winter wares, but according to Norwegian designer FWSS,  it’s all about the coloured check. There’s plenty on the high street to choose from. We’ll be getting our hands on this wrap over midi from Mango to style with a grey roll neck and sock boots for now, and switch to a white blouse and straw bag come spring. Picture credit: Indigital Images/ OSLO RUNWAY Designer: FWSS  Checked skirt, £49.99, Mango Checked dress, £19.99, H&M If there’s one thing we learnt from visiting Oslo Fashion Week, it’s that literally everyone is wearing statement earrings. The catwalk at Michael Olestad was filled with rainbow ear-candy, and every street styler on the FROW sported their biggest baubles. Go large, bright and bold, or go home. Basically. The high street is filled with incarnations that’ll rival that of the catwalk, the yellow Topshop numbers (below) have to be one of our faves. Match them to your outfit for a designer vibe, or clash with other bright hues for an all round show-stopper of an outfit.  Picture credit: Indigital Images/ OSLO RUNWAY Designer: Michael Olestad  Earrings, £12.50, Topshop Say hey to the bum bag’s chicer sister: the belt bag. Yep, it’s similar to the ’90s fave but it’s way more glam. Style it with you skirts, belt it over your trench coats, heck why not even put it through your mom jean loop holes. This will be the new hard-working accessory you’ll wonder how you ever lived without. Want to know the best part? There’s no way you have to wait until next autumn/winter to wear it, there’s tonnes of sleek styles out there. Picture credit: Indigital Images/ OSLO RUNWAY Designer: Maud  Bag, £22, Topshop Tine Andrea @tineandreaa 94.2k You’ll love her because: Not only does she have the most effortless Scandi style, she also travels the world giving you all the style tips for every season, in every destination. If there’s one thing you’ll want from Tine’s wardrobe it’s her endless accessories collection. Yes, we see you Céline sunnies.   Darja Barannik @darjabarannik 114k You’ll love her because: Not only does she look sophisticated at all times, she manages to style classic wardrobe staples in a luxe way we can all copy. We may not have the £££ for the designer wares, but if we can imitate it, that’s just as good, right? Right (kind of).   Nina Sandbeck @ninasandbech 32.5k Why you’ll love her: The girlie separates mixed with statement accessories and a friendly face makes her to-die-for ‘drobe seem that little bit more accessible. Prepare for #OOTD inspo from every post.     LOOK’s deputy fashion editor Harriet Davey went for a green sweater from New Look with a clashing pink check skirt from M&S (it will be available in stores and online early Feb). Teaming the combo with a vinyl trench and white ankle boots completely the look for the shows.    Jumper, £17.99, New Look  Skirt, £25, M&S (in store and online second week of feb) For the after parties Harriet opted for the Eastern print Rixo dress-of-dreams with a striped roll neck underneath (it was -3 degrees, people) and matchy-matchy accessories. A slick of red lippie is a must.    Dress, £220.83, Rixo It’s time to embrace a hint of Scandi cool in to all our our lives: think effortless styling hacks, simple wardrobe staples becoming your new BFFs and Norway’s influencers taking over your Insta feeds. Until next season, Oslo. They may look designer but the price tag certainly isn't! Oh hello new season Primark bags. If, like us, you can’t get enough of their purse friendly and fashion forward styles then you’ll love their new season collection Primark is always our first stop shop when on the hunt for a new bag that wont break the bank, because let’s face it – the trend-savvy retailer ticks all the right boxes when it comes to arm candy.   So whether you’re on the hunt for that statement day bag or a super chic and stylish evening clutch, you won’t be disappointed with this latest drop of bags. If it’s a total bargain you love then opt for the small but equally as chic yellow cross-body bag (only £3!) Because who can say no to a trendy and budget-friendly bag, eh?    Box bag, £10, Primark Fresh and fun this boxy style will instantly lift your office wardrobe and elevating tired 9-to-5 looks with ease. Orange is the new black is not just our fave show but rather our mantra for the season. A little colour does the world of good – especially on these rainy days!    Round bag, £9, Primark Go hands-free this summer with a circular cross body. Primark have this compact and fun tasselled style in three colours – at just £8 each you’d be easily forgiven for purchasing one in each and every shade. Chic and in an oh-so on trend circular shape this will quickly become your go-to!

It’s £12 and will help you pretend it’s summer and that going out without tights and a jacket is a totally okay idea because really, who needs coat check?  Pineapple bag, £8, Primark When you’re picking up new accessories for £10 and under there’s no excuse not to opt for something a little fun. Novelty bags are such a fun, conversational additional to any look and we especially love this £8 pineapple style from Primark’s new season collection. With a delicate gold-toned cross body strap it’s something you’ll be surprised to discover will truly work with anything to any occasion from summer holiday to, fancy dress! Or where it's from...  New spring collections are dropping in all of our favourite high street stores. Topshop’s chocka-block with printed tea dresses, while we have approx 149 Zara accessories sat in our online baskets – yes, they’re that good – but it’s Tu at Sainsbury’s brand new Premium collection that we can’t stop thinking about. Yes, you read that correctly. Tu at Sainsbury’s.    From embroidered jumpers to scallop detail denim skirts, we wouldn’t blame you for thinking this was designer gear, never-mind budget-friendly Sainsbo’s. Inspired by the street-style of Milan, the collection ranges from £18 to £99 for a premium leather biker jacket.   We love this acid yellow knit with silver ring detailing for the office. Simply style tucked into some tailored, wide leg trousers and team with a simple silver bangle or watch. While this denim jacket with Ganni-inspired frilled cuffs and collar, looks way more spenny than it’s £30 price tag. Come spring, it will be your go-to cover-up. Trust us.  Knitted Top, £28, Tu at Sainsbury’s SHOP IT  Denim Jacket, £30, Tu at Sainsbury’s SHOP IT Looking to update your holiday wardrobe early? Then this linen stripe co-ord set is a must. Effortlessly stylish? Tick. Will keep you cool in the heat? Tick. Cheaper than dinner at Pizza Express? Tick. Imagine walking down the beach, wearing this, basket bag in hand. Sold? Sold.   Cropped Trousers, £25, Tu at Sainsbury’s (Drops into store and online on 1st April)   SEE: Best Winter Coats To See You Through February And Beyond But our top pick from the collection has to be this embroidered jumper. We mean, seriously, how is this only £30?! Style with jeans and Converse at the weekend or dress it up with a metallic leather mini and red ankle boots for Friday night cocktails.  Embroidered Jumper, £30, Tu at Sainsbury’s SHOP IT  Denim skirt, £25. Tu at Sainsbury’s SHOP IT   Launching on the 4th February, and with prices starting from just £18 this collection is set to fly off the supermarket shelves. All items are available in sizes 8-22. To summarize, it puts the ‘super’ in supermarché. It is uncanny Remember the £25 Chloé bag copy we told you about last summer? The one that had been instagrammed 44,000 times (literally) and cost almost £1000 less than the original? Well, we’ve got another one. An even better one. Last time it was the Chloé Faye- the larger tote style- but this time it’s all about the Chloé Pixie- the small, round style with the gold handle. Anyone with an Instagram account will know the one we mean, but in case not, here it is:    Bag, £1020, Chloé At £1020, it’s not the cheapest of bags; we mean, it’s more than our rent. That’s why, when we came across River Island’s round leather crossbody bag, we had to do a double take- first because we honestly thought it was the Chloé Pixie, and second because of the price tag next to it: £60. That’s £960 cheaper than the real deal, if you’re wondering.   SEE: You Won’t Believe This £25 Chloe Bag Copy  Bag, £60, River Island at Very There are a few reasons this is so exciting: 1) the black shade and simple shape goes with literally everything in our wardrobe, 2) it can be worn as both a grab and crossbody bag, and 3) everyone worth their street style salt has one. Here’s how to wear it:   Wear as a grab bag and team with LBD, check coat and red ankle sock boots. Add a slick of red lippy and you’re good to go.   Use the strap as a crossbody and style with chunky knit, pleated skirt and oversized cosy coat. Sunnies optional.   Channel all the trends and try check trews, oversized trucker jacket and mirrored aviators, or go for a leather mini skirt and Mary-Janes.   The possibilities really are endless. Very, we salute you. Better bag it quickly though  Is there anything we love more than Holly Willoughby’s style? The TV presenter often has us running to the shops with the outfits she wears on This Morning. From that £10 boohoo bodysuit to the infamous Hobbs jumper that sold out in practically no time, we often turn to Holly for style advice.   Heck, we’ve even started turning to the star for beauty advice now. Not only did we rush to our nearest superdrug to pick up the lipstick Holly wore on Dancing On Ice’s disco week, but after learning Holly’s foundation is only £5.70 we’ve also slyly added that into our daily make-up bag. Well, once again we’ve turned to the daytime TV presenter’s wardrobe for some OOTD inspo – and you might want to grab your credit cards and head to your nearest shopping centre for this one. Yesterday, Holly and Phil interviewed Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall on This Morning – which you can catch on today’s show.   For the interview Holly opted for a truly elegant floral midi dress, which has gone down a treat with her 3.2 million followers. The white chiffon dress featured stunning pink and red flowers and soft bell sleeves, which the mum of three teamed with a gorgeous pair of pink heels. Although Holly’s dress may look like it would have a designer price tag, the Massimo Dutti design can be yours for just £99.95 and would make a great addition to your summer wardrobe. Better be quick though, at that price we’re predicting a sell out. By Alexandra Whittaker From the editors of InStyle US   Kate Middleton and Prince William have had an eventful trip to Sweden so far. It seems that, as well as playing a hockey game, Kate is choosing to have a little fashion fun. The couple stepped out for a black-tie dinner at the Residence of the British Ambassador, and they were dressed to the nines. While William stuck with a signature black suit and bow tie, Middleton opted to take a rare fashion risk in a floor-length bright golden yellow gown with a high neck by Erdem.     The royal left her neutral-toned morning look by the wayside in a move that literally set her apart from everyone else in the room. As she and Prince William met Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Löfven and his wife Ulla Löfven, who wore neutrals, Middleton’s statement-making print dress demanded attention.  Middleton has a history of wearing solid-coloured short-sleeve dresses to formal events, so this look is a rarity in her fashion repertoire. At the Royal Variety Performance last November, she wore a blue Elsa-like dress, which is more emblematic of her normal black tie style, as she regularly wears dresses that have one primary colour. We’re crossing our fingers that we’ll see more dramatic style looks from her on this trip. Who knew Sweden would bring out such an unconventional side of Middleton? We LOVE the way she layered it with Rixo and Boden pieces We all know Holly Willoughby loves a high-street number, and now she’s found us an insane barg’ we really need to copy. The 36-year-old surprised us by revealing she was wearing a £10 number on This Morning today, a chic teal bodysuit from Boohoo.   Sharing her daily outfit post on Instagram, Holly told fans: ‘Today’s look on Tuesdays @thismorning … dress by @rixolondon knitwear by @boohoo and boots by @boden_clothing tights by @wolford #hwstyle💁✨.’   Holly had layered the piece with a plunging Rixo dress, which featured a stand-out geometric print and an A-line skirt.   Paired with loose waves and a heeled ankle boots, she’d perfected a wintry 70s vibe. As expected, fans agreed. Comments included: ‘You are actual inspirational with the clothes you wear!!! I love it! Genuinely wish I looked like you every day 😍🙌🏼🙊,’ and: ‘You look gorgeous as always x [sic].’  Buy now While we’re digging Holly’s look, there are plenty of other ways you could wear the body. In fact, its simple shape and all-over colour make it super-versatile. We’d brave bare legs and a leather mini skirt for a night out with the girls, or add a furry gillet and skinny jeans for a Saturday shopping trip. But at £10, we’re not sure it’ll be in stock for long… Holly Willoughby never fails to get the audience talking. Whether it’s her perfect handling of a guest on This Morning, or her go-to skin cover-up that costs a mere £5.70, there’s always something that grabs the attention of Holly’s fans.   Today the ITV presenter stepped on-screen in another winning outfit. As usual, Holly took to the ‘gram to share the details with fans.   As a regular high street goer, we weren’t all that surprised to discover that the mum-of-three had opted for Topshop.   Holly’s patterned mini skirt comes in at a very affordable £32 and you’ll be pleased to hear that, at time of print, it’s still in stock.  BUY NOW Holly paired hers with a contrasting blue polo neck jumper and casual ankle boots. It’s fair to say that, once again, her fans were full of compliments. Comments included: ‘The skirt 😍😍’, ‘I want her whole wardrobe 🙈🙈’ and ‘this skirts a winner’ [sic]. Looking beaut, lady. From puffers to parkers, we're *obsessed* with the new drop of Primark coats. And with prices as low as £9 we might just buy the whole lot.  If you haven’t yet seen the latest Primark coats in store then get ready to be wowed. Yep, the high street fashion favourite Primark has released their latest collection of coats and it’s fair to say it’s uh-mazing. Inspired by the catwalk but transformed into high street fashion at affordable prices, this is the only place you want to look for that fashion must have, without breaking the bank.     The ultimate must-buy of 2018, the puffa coat is a ticks-all-the-boxes purchase. Stylish, warm, waterproof and long-lasting, yep, if you are looking for something practical to keep out the cold snap (and the guaranteed English drizzle), then this season’s must-have puffa coat is probably the best way to tackle winter. Sports-luxe inspired zippers give this £15 coat a high-end appeal.  Black Padded Puffa jacket, £15, Primark     Not just for casual weekends in the country, parka coats have had a revamp for this season and Primark is definitely giving celeb-fave Barbour a run for their money with this chic design. But at a fraction of the price, obvs.  Furry Hooded Parka, £25, Primark This is quite possibly our fave out of all of the new Primark coats, plus nothing beats a colourful cover up to take you from the cold season into Spring. From baby blue to rust orange and soft grey, Primark’s suedette styles work for the office and weekends alike and they’ll never date.  Suedette Duster Coat, £25, Primark  When in doubt you can’t go wrong with a classic camel Mac. Plus its making a major comeback for SS’18. Bonus! Try wearing this over a tailored jumpsuit to the office or with a simple jeans-and-tee combo during those off-duty days. Stone Trench, £15, Primark  Scroll down to see more of the very best coats from one of our fave high street hot spots. New year, new you, new gym kit... Primark has long been our one-stop shop for all things fashion, but did you know they also stock a pretty fabulous range of Primark sportswear that is ticking ALL of our workout boxes right now. Because lets face it ladies, buying comfortable and affordable sportswear can quite often become a little bit of a retail mission. First you have to try and find the right clothes to suit your workout (yoga, cross training, boxercise, etc), then you have to make sure it’s comfy before embarking on some mammoth gym session (no one likes chaffing), and lastly, it also has to suit the tightness of your purse strings. That’s where Primark sportswear comes in.   Primark have provided us with the solution to all our sportswear woes and thanks to a new collaboration with Alice Liveing, including some uber stylish and super-wearable gym pieces that will fit every exercise need, without breaking the bank, we can all wear some of the hottest pieces in town. Crop Top, £5, Primark     With separates starting from only £3.50, you can no longer sack off that spin class you planned with your BFF because you have ‘nothing to wear’. These ones are so good, we don’t ever want to take them off. 
 SEE: Sportswear: The Best New Buys Leggings, £6, Primark As well as stylish ties and mesh panels, Primark leggings also have the added benefit of seamfree lines, lightweight fabrics, and super breathable shapes; all key factors in making sure that your gym kit performs as well as it looks. If high impact sport isn’t your thing then don’t panic; Primark  has some rather chic pieces for all you yoga and pilates girls out there who prefer the stretch over the burn – we’re particularly loving their urban style mesh panelled leggings: a great way to add a cute little twist to your yoga kit.

We’ll take one of each. You know the drill ladies – don’t leave it too long to get down to your nearest Primark store- these pieces will be snapped up quicker than you can say protein shake.

She and girlfriend St Vincent have been together a while now and looked TOTALLY loved-up at Paris Fashion Week. Could this be because they've just got engaged?! Whatever the case, we're loving seeing Cara look so happy. Confirming reports that her fiance sports manager Dave Gardner proposed over Christmas, Liv Tyler shared a candid snap to Instagram showcasing the diamond encrusted rock.

Filming her new film The Leftovers in the big apple, the couple had been spending time with David Beckham - best friend of Dave and godfather to their son.  Binky Felstead's big sister Anna-Louise - who appeared on Made In Chelsea New York - got engaged to her boyfriend James Maltin with *this* stunning sparkler. And all we can say is WOW.

The actress has been snapped with this stunning piece of jewellery on her ring finger numerous times, prompting many to wonder whether it signals an engagement with her British cinematographer boyfriend Ben Richardson.

If Anna is engaged, we're sending massive congratulations. Remember Casey Reinhardt from Laguna Beach? Well, she's now engaged to boyf Sean Michael Brown - and just LOOK at the size of her ring.

Laker hubby Lamar Odom after he got down on one knee with this 9-carat round radiant-cut stone. That's one weighty accessory!  Blake Lively's sparkler has got to be one of the most expensive rock's on the Hollywood block. The Gossip Girl star may have wed Ryan Reynolds in secret, but there's no hiding this GIANT ring rumoured to be worth an eye-watering $2million! Oval cut, the super-girly 12-carat light pink diamond is on of our faves (as is Blake's hubby). Justin Theroux made Jennifer Aniston one of the happiest ladies in Celebsville when he slipped this 8-carat emerald cut glistener on her ring finger back in Autumn 2012. Second time lucky, eh Jen?  Joel Madden proposed to style maven Nicole Richie in February 2012 and was clever enough to steer clear of designing the ring. Rocking an octagonal diamond frame set off with a platinum and diamond band, Nic's super-sized sparkler was co-created by her and jewellery crafter Neil Lane. This lady certainly knows what she likes. Brad Pitt locked his lady down with a hand-crafted super-chic ring that took him a year to design! Working with jeweller Robert Procop, he picked out the oblong rock and framed the gem with smaller sqaure diamonds which cost an estimated $250,000.  Halle Berry's "one of a kind, irreplaceable" emerald and diamond rock has us green with jealousy. And not just because it's reflecting on us.

Ashley Cole proposed to gorgeous Geordie Cheryl Cole with this super-girly £100,000 heart-shaped engagement ring which she swiftly removed after rumours of him cheating surfaced.

Rumour has it, Meghan Markle has found The One. And no, this time we’re not talking about Prince Harry.   Finding the perfect dress is one of the biggest feats when planning a wedding, and it seems as though Hazza’s beau has finally found her match.   What’s more, US Weekly reports, fittings have officially begun.   Tweeting from a verified account, reporter Omid Scobie informed royal fans: ‘Sources tell me that Meghan Markle has officially picked a wedding dress designer and had her first fitting at Kensington Palace last week…’ ‘BFF and bridal expert Jessica Mulroney is guiding Meghan though the process and quietly flew in to London on Jan 10, spending four days at the couple’s Nottingham Cottage home,’ he added. Prince Harry proposed while he and Meghan were cooking together Further tweets revealed: ‘I’m told that they went through a number of options with the designer and Meghan was “incredibly excited” to see things start coming together. ‘Jessica, who is an accomplished fashion advisor and bridal stylist, has helped piece together a number of Meghan’s most recent looks (including her iconic engagement announcement outfit). She is also helping with several other wedding day elements.’     Eek. So which designer has the future royal chosen? Well, sadly, it looks like we won’t be finding out anytime soon… ‘Right now only a small, select group of people know the designer’s name, so don’t expect to find out any time soon. Even Harry made himself scarce during the first fitting!’ Well, we cannot wait for our first glimpse. By Olivia Bahou From the editors of InStyle US   Meghan Markle is continuing to break with royal tradition left and right, and her latest statement was made with a pair of earrings. Or rather, earrings that were most definitely not a pair. The 36-year-old stepped out for an official engagement with Prince Harry in Cardiff yesterday, wearing two totally different earrings. Meghan had a stud in her right lobe   On her left ear, she had on a now-sold-out Gabriela Artigas Triple Shooting Star Earring, which looks like an ear crawler. On her right ear, Meghan wore the Zofia Day Dash Ear Studs ($575; zofiaday.com). Both of the geometrical studs give a cool-girl vibe to that look that we’re not used to seeing in the Royal Family. Add onto that the fact that Markle wore her hair in a messy bun for the second time to a royal engagement, and she forwent a dress and tights for an off-the-shoulder jacket and black jeans, and we’re totally verklempt over her latest look. Meghan was joined by fiancé Prince Harry in Cardiff What’s next, Meghan? Mismatched shoes? A crop top? Daisy dukes? We’ll be waiting on the edge of our seats to find out when this future royal steps out next with her fiancé. By Brandi Fowler From the editors of InStyle US   The world’s most stylish family? Check. Ever the trend-setting trio, Victoria, David and Brooklyn Beckham turned heads as they hit the front row of the Louis Vuitton autumn 2018 menswear show in Paris yesterday, with each one making a fashion statement. Victoria matched her husband’s swagger in mustard trousers and a beige long line coat, and completed the look with a red and white striped button down and a burgundy turtleneck.    David, meanwhile, strolled by her side in a navy sweater paired with matching trousers and a khaki-colored long-line coat. Their 18-year-old son looked just as dapper as he sat next to Victoria in a grey wool long-lined coat paired with a Red signature Louis Vuitton top, skinny jeans, and suede booties. ‘Emotional day for @mrkimjones X so pleased to be here for you x kisses from Paris x @davidbeckham @brooklynbeckham @louisvuitton,’ Victoria wrote on her Instagram, alongside a photo of them posing with Kim Jones, the Men’s Artistic Director for the brand.   ‘Well done, Matie boy. Lots of love,’ Brooklyn added in a video post from the show. As the family took in the Louis Vuitton collection, they didn’t just watch male models rock the duds on the catwalk. Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell strutted down the runway too, with both stunning in coordinating Louis Vuitton logo-emblazoned coats.   They were both in the video Brooklyn posted, walking by Jones’s side as he wrapped the show. Prince Harry's bride-to-be was sending a clear message during their trip to Wales... We’ve always known that Meghan Markle was a pretty remarkable woman. Way before she’d even met her prince, the 36-year-old was making a name for herself as quite the humanitarian. Taking on her role as a UN women’s advocate, Meghan delivered a powerful and inspiring speech which told the story of her very first fight for equality – at the age of eleven.     The actress, who also found fame on the TV screen thanks to her role in Suits, has always had a passion for philanthropy. Having worked as a Global Ambassador for World Vision (visiting places such as Delhi and Mumbai to meet with young girls that struggle to get access to menstrual products) and regularly speaking out about world issues, particularly those that affect women, Meghan has always been very aware of the world.   So it’s hardly a surprise that, in her new role as part of the Royal Family, she’s continuing to support causes that mean something.  Prince Harry and Meghan made headlines yesterday, thanks to their third public engagement as a couple. At first glance, it seemed that Meghan had simply perfected the smart-casual look with in an all-black ensemble and complimentary laid-back hairstyle. But, upon closer inspection, it seems that Prince Harry’s future bride may have put quite a bit more thought into her #OOTD. Her stylish wrap coat was by none other than Stella McCartney, a designer who is famous for being both cruelty-free and sustainable. What’s more, as Time points out, her cute little accessory was by DeMellier London. So much more than a stylish piece of arm candy, they give proceeds from each handbag to the non-profit organisation SOS Children’s Villages; the world’s largest charity working with orphaned and abandoned children. As part of the brand’s A Bag, A Life initiative, funding is given to medical programmes in countries such as Somalia and Zambia where children, tragically, tend to die young.  Finally, Meghan’s black jeans were Hiut denim, which just so happens to be a boutique Welsh brand. Yup, you may remember that the royal couple were visiting Cardiff, so this would have sent a message of solidarity and support for local business. Top marks, Meghan. This. Is. Amazing.  By Chloe MacDonnell From the editors of Marie Claire   If your answer to the weekly Friday night question of ‘what are you wearing’ is usually ‘jeans and a nice top’ then you’re going to love Missguided’s new website genre. On January 3, Twitter user Jennifer Stewart tweeted: ‘Wish there was a tab on like Missguided, pretty little thing etc for ‘jeans and a nice top.” The brand replied with a gif of a man tapping his forehead with the comment, ‘noted’.   Fast-forward less than two weeks and a ‘jeans and a nice top’ section has appeared. Missguided announced the news by replying: ‘WE DID IT. Now shop to it.’  The new section features a selection of tops you can pair with your usual go-to pair of jeans. The brand stated: ‘Party season might be over but that doesn’t mean the partying is. If you’re looking for a new outfit for this weekend, or whenever, you’ve come to the right place. ‘Whether you’re looking for going out tops to wear with jeans in the form of sequins or lace, or fancy a long-sleeved style to pair with your new favourite denim, we’ve got everything your wardrobe is probably calling out for. ‘Keep on scrollin’ for plunge tops and high neck numbers for those ‘jeans and a nice top’ kinda events…’ Users and fans of the brand seem to be thrilled about the news, with many taking to Twitter to express their excitement. One said: ‘Not all heroes wear capes – @Missguided have introduced every girls dream link ‘jeans and a nice top.” Others added: ‘Missguided now has a “jeans and a nice top” section what a day to be alive’ and ‘The fact @Missguided have brought out the ‘jeans and a nice top’ category is actually revolutionary, the little things in life.’ TAKE OUR MONEY From the editors of InStyle We’d all love a Gucci piece (or three) in our wardrobes. But sadly, this isn’t always possible.   Screw you, electricity bill.  However, if you’re keen to get the Gucci girl look without paying the price tag, we’ve got some amazing news for you. Because we’ve just found a dead-ringer for the monochrome GG Marmont Matelassé Mini Bag at Accessorize.   No, it doesn’t have the brand’s signature logo – but it does boast the same zig-zag pattern, gold chain, quilted material and slouchy shape.  BUY NOW And for £25, you can’t really go wrong. Gucci’s version is currently selling for £795 on Farfetch, meaning you’re saving a whopping £770. We’ve got a feeling it won’t be in stock for long, so you’d better get in quick. We know exactly where we’re headed… By Alexandra Whittaker This article originally appeared on InStyle US   Let’s cut to the chase: Kate Middleton’s sense of style is downright enviable. Between the vibrant coats and the tasteful dresses, she steps out wearing prim and proper looks on a daily basis, and royal fans can’t get enough of it. But sometimes, even Middleton needs to keep things casual, as she demonstrated clearly on Wednesday. In an uncharacteristic move, Middleton wore athleisure while out on an official royal visit. She traded in a scarlet Boden peacoat she wore earlier in the day for a pair of black and white gym trousers, a white zip-up jacket, and trainers. In true Middleton fashion, her delicate teardrop earrings remained on despite the laid-back outfit.   While her look might raise eyebrows, it was totally appropriate for her day.  The Duchess of Cambridge wore the sporty ensemble while visiting the Wimbledon Foundation’s Junior Tennis Initiative as a patron of Wimbledon. There, she met students who benefited from the foundation’s free tennis coaching. During her trip, she also showed a better glimpse at her growing baby bump.   While royals don’t often step out so casually, on rare occasions even they like to indulge in comfy athletic gear. Middleton has, in fact, worn gym wear as outerwear before, and just a few weeks ago, Meghan Markle wore your favourite go-to gym hairstyle during a royal occasion. Since Middleton is dressed down for such a sport-specific event, it’s really no surprise that she played a bit of tennis herself while at the event. She even helped kids practice their drills by throwing balls to them. Kensington Palace tweeted out a photo of Middleton in a huddle with kids while holding a neon blue and yellow racket of her own. Looks like dressing the part paid off. The bride-to-be isn't allowed access to the crown jewels just yet...  We don’t have long before Meghan Markle and Prince Harry‘s wedding. Yup, it’s safe to say that we’ve had the big day highlighted in our diaries ever since Kensington Palace first announced it at the end of last year. The former Suits actress has fast become one of the most sought-after women in the country (if not the world) and we’ve all been hanging on her every move; from the sell-out M&S jumper she was spotted in, to the internet’s OTT reaction to a switch-up in her hairstyle.    Considering she’s preparing to marry a prince, there’s one thing that a lot of people seem to be wondering: WHEN will we get to see Ms. Markle in a tiara? Well, hold that thought. Because it looks like Meghan won’t be rocking the crown jewels any time soon.   According to The Mirror, there are strict rules against unmarried women wearing tiaras. ‘Flashy diamonds and tiaras are not worn during the day, and only married ladies wear tiaras,’ etiquette expert Grant Harold told the BBC.  So that also explains why Kate Middleton, Duchess of Cambridge, is regularly seen wearing some fancy headgear. Harold continued: ‘For married ladies it was a sign of status and would show you were taken and not looking for a husband. ‘For the gentleman it was a clear sign not to make advances toward the lady in question.’  So, traditionally, that crown means a lot more than just royal affiliation. Like Kate, once Meghan has tied the knot and is officially ‘off the market’, she should – in theory – have access to a tiara for suitable royal engagements. To be fair, seeing as Meghan and Harry have displayed their commitment and devotion to one another on the world stage, we don’t think a tiara (or lack of one) is going to make a difference to her assumed ‘status’. This girl is clearly taken. 'It would fall off' From the editors of Marie Claire UK Later this year will see the 65th anniversary of the Queen’s coronation – just one of the huge royal occasions of the year – we’re looking at you Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.   Marking the special occasion, the Queen has taken part in a BBC documentary, airing this Sunday and we’re apparently set to see Queen Elizabeth like we’ve never seen her before. The Coronation will see the 91-year-old monarch in conversation with expert on the Crown jewels, Alastair Bruce, as together they re-watch footage of the day and recount memories of everything from the uncomfortable carriage ride and her children not doing what they were told to how she managed to keep the crown on her head.     Describing the crown as ‘unwieldy’, the Queen explained how it was adapted after the death of her father to fit her. ‘You see, it’s much smaller isn’t it?!’ she pointed out to Alastair Bruce while watching the coronation footage. ‘You know, it would have been up to about there when my father wore it – fortunately my father and I have the same sort of shaped head. But once you put it on it stays. I mean it just remains on.’ ‘It’s difficult to always remember that diamonds are stones and so they’re very heavy,’ explained Alastair Bruce, observing, ‘You have to keep your head very still.’ ‘Yes,’ the Queen agreed. ‘You can’t look down to read the speech – you have to take the speech up – because if you did your neck would break’ she exclaimed. ‘It would fall off’.  She even went on to explain how the priceless jewels were hidden during the Second World War in the event of a Nazi invasion – and gave away their hiding place. According to the monarch, her father George VI ordered for the jewels to be hidden in the grounds of Windsor Castle, where they were buried, hidden in a biscuit tin. We’ll definitely be tuning in on Sunday to hear more of these stories, especially after Alastair Bruce enthused that it will showcase the monarch’s ‘most delightful sense of humour.’ The Coronation is set to be broadcast on BBC One on Sunday. And we love it By Lara Walsh From the editors of InStyle.com   New year, new style resolutions for Angelina Jolie. As the brunette beauty made her entrance at the Critics’ Choice Awards on Thursday evening, she took a sartorial risk by leaving her go-to black dress behind for a surprise LWD on the red carpet.   Taking her style cues from the other end of the color palette, the First They Killed My Father director was literally glowing as she traded out her trademark LBD for a flirty asymmetrical white number featuring a thigh-high slit, a draped hem, and a feathered strapless bodice.  The actress proved that white can be worn any time of the year as she winterized the playful gown with a ruby lip, a voluminous half up-do, and the ultimate ice queen accessories: statement crystal drop earrings and silver pointy-toed ankle strap heels. Leave it to Jolie to slay any red carpet, no matter the color palette! You can bag yourself a royal-approved frock for just £65....  From the editors of Marie Claire  We all know Kate Middleton is big on re-wearing her clothes, and things are no different when it comes to her maternity wardrobe.   The 36-year-old – who’s expecting her third child with husband Prince William – sported one of her favourite maternity dresses while making her first public appearance of 2018 yesterday.  Kate opted for a dress by Seraphine to visit Reach Academy Feltham in west London, a school that works with children’s mental health charity Place2Be.   We can totally see why she was keen to recycle the piece. She looked lovely in the knee-length design, which featured a blue and green floral print and and a floaty skirt.   She’d paired it with a sold-out Hobbs double-breasted wool coat and Jimmy Choo Georgia pumps, which she’s also worn before. According to PEOPLE, Kate stepped out in the dress twice when she was pregnant with daughter Princess Charlotte. In fact, Seraphine has been a long-time favourite of the Duchess. Kate and William, 35, are expecting third child in April. They’re already parents to Prince George, four, and two-year-old Charlotte, who recently started nursery school at Willcocks Nursery School. You'll want to expand your ring collection after reading this... From the editors of Marie Claire UK Meghan Markle’s engagement ring has become our main obsession of late, but while we’ve all been distracted with Royal wedding plans, and of course, the Suits actress’ incredible M&S jumper, we seem to have all overlooked something potentially significant—her other ring choices.   On her recent royal visit to Brixton with Prince Harry, Meghan wore three gold rings on her right hand, which according to some experts, may carry symbolic meaning. We’re not talking about the kind of sentimental meaning embedded in the diamonds of her gorgeous engagement ring, which as well know was designed by Prince Harry himself. No, this time it’s the placement of Meghan’s rings that has become the talking point. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are getting married in May   After analysing the gold bands on her right thumb, index finger and ring finger, experts have claimed that Meghan may be revealing more about her personality than she perhaps realised. According to MailOnline, in traditional palmistry (bear with us) wearing a ring on your thumb can read as a symbol of ‘motivation, control or aggression’, suggesting Meghan is no stranger to taking the lead. Having starred as the protagonist in a hit TV show for over six years, that’s probably not so surprising a trait.   The ring on her index finger, meanwhile, is said to represent ‘a freshly appointed king, queen or CEO,’ while the very choice to wear rings on your right hand is traditionally thought to be a sign of ‘stubbornness or need to be in control of your public life.’ Now it goes without saying that perhaps Meghan Markle just likes her gold rings and popped them on that morning simply because they looked nice. Which they most certainly do. But with the mounting pressure of becoming a royal bride-to-be, and extra press scrutiny every time she steps out of the house (or palace), we can well understand if Meghan might want to exert a little more control over her life. Either way, we’re off shopping for gold thumb rings ASAP.        Wedding shoes are just as important as the dress, so we've tracked down the best for the bride-to-be...

 The trainer and influencer is a bride-to-be! 👰 From the editors of InStyle.co.uk Meghan Markle may not yet be married to Prince Harry, but she’s already an honorary Brit.   The 36-year-old headed to Reprezent Radio in Brixton yesterday in a black Marks & Spencer jumper. And let’s be honest, that’s pretty much the most British thing you can wear. The black knit featured a high neck and bell sleeves, and Meghan had paired the piece with Burberry trousers and a loose ponytail.     Of course, the jumper is already sold out on M&S’s website. But if it happens to come back into stock, here’s where to nab it…  Buy now If you can’t wait to get the Meghan look, we’ve also found a couple of similar versions on the high street…  Buy now  Buy now Now we’ve just got to find the prince, right? From oval shapes to yellow diamonds... Whether you’re in a relationship or not, we’re willing to bet a lot of money that you’ve thought about your perfect engagement ring a good few times. Would you prefer a diamond? A ruby? A gold band? A vintage piece? Well, whatever your style, there are already a few ring trends emerging for 2018.   Femail spoke to gemologist and director at Pluczenik Grant Mobley to learn all about them. So if you think your partner may be about to pop the question, you may want to take note… Meghan Markle’s three-diamond engagement ring is a stunner According to Grant, this is a ‘classic style which will never go out of fashion’. But one recent royal engagement certainly gave it a boost.   He says: ‘Three stone rings have been around for a long time, but their popularity has significantly increased following some high-profile engagements such as Meghan Markle.’ See: Celebrity Engagement Rings: See The Best  ‘Real diamonds have been used for engagement rings for centuries because of their symbolism of love, authenticity and strength,’ says Grant. ‘But while they have been big in the engagement world for hundreds of years, recently laboratory-grown diamonds have started cropping up in jewellery – and they are not understood.’ It seems there’s no need for these to be understood, as it’s all about the real deal in 2018. Blake Lively is rocking an oval ring Celebrities boasting jewels in this cut include Blake Lively and Serena Williams. Grant explains: ‘What many don’t realise is that elongated diamond cuts such as the oval usually appeal larger next to the same size round, or square cut diamond. ‘This size illusion makes a great choice for an everlasting investment.’ Well done Ryan Reynolds. Kelly Clarkson’s yellow diamond is beautiful If you prefer the finer things in life, you may want make like Kelly Clarkson and Nicki Minaj with a yellow diamond. ‘There has been an increase in popularity for fancy yellow diamonds in the last couple of decades, but they only recently became frequently used in engagement rings,’ says Grant. ‘Yellow diamonds with a fancy grading are even rarer than white diamonds, and generally come at a higher value, making them a natural celeb favourite.’ Alison Brie received a rose gold piece from Dave Franco It’s not surprising that this is set to be a massive trend. We mean, pretty much everything else we own is rose gold. Grant explains: ‘When it comes to choosing a metal for an engagement ring, the most popular conventional choices have been white, yellow gold and platinum. ‘Other options have never been widely popular, but recent times show that these will become a thing of the past.’ All anyone can talk about today is Perrie Edwards’ latest Instagram photos. And we can see why, because she looks INSANE. The Little Mix singer, 24, shared a series of snaps of herself in a white bikini last night, which she’d (interestingly) paired with a matching cardigan and fluffy slippers.     Um, can we just talk about that bod? But it wasn’t just her toned abs that people were wowed by. What we wanted to know was… where did she pick up her bobble-trimmed cardi?!   See: Why Wasn’t Perrie Edwards At Jade Thirlwall’s 25th Birthday Party? Well, we did our research and found it online. It’s from Mum’s Handmade, and is a tad pricey at £194.10. But if you’re happy to splash out on a winter warmer, here it is…  Buy now If you’re looking to nab Perrie’s look for less, we’ve also stumbled upon a few cheaper versions…  Buy now  Buy now BRB, gotta go squat. Wearing all black for the #TimesUp movement these seven A-List stars bought style to solidarity and sisterhood. The Golden Globes 2018 provided the most politically charged red carpet to date with all your favourite A-Listers opting to unite and show their support for the #TimesUp movement. Standing together in their all black looks and sharing #WhyWeWearBlack on both the red carpet and across their social platforms. Following on from the sexual harassment scandal which swept Hollywood opening up the conversation to inequality, injustice and starting the #MeToo movement.   Taking a stand this award season the all black looks debuted on the Golden Globes red carpet were accompanied by a demand for an end to the sexual harassment, discrimination and assault which has been revealed as rife across the entertainment industry. This season it wasn’t about ‘who are you wearing’ but rather ‘why.’ However, we’re all about recognition and empowerment at LOOK and want to shout out the amazing designers, stylists and teams behind these exceptional looks. Here are seven of our favourites, the teams who helped create them and ways you can shop the look…   1, Dakota Johnson  Styled by Kate Young, Dakota’s Gucci dress and Nirav Moda diamonds shone on the red carpet. Captioning a post on her Instagram and sharing that ‘today I wear black in solidarity with women who have experienced harassment, and to encourage all women—no matter their age or profession—to know their worth, stand up for themselves, and know they are supported. #TIMESUP‘ Dakota’s make up artist Kate Lee opted for a classic English Rose look with lashings of mascara and blush rose lip. LOOK’s Deputy Beauty Editor, Chloe Burcham, recommends Charlotte Tilbury’s ‘Kidmans Kiss’ and Urban Decay’s Trouble Maker mascara to replicate the look.   2, Octavia Spencer  Wearing an incredible sequinned LBD Octavia’s Tadashi Shoji dress was off-set by classic Jimmy Choo peep-toe shoes and Irene Neuwirth jewellery. Octavia not only shared her solidarity through her look but also across her social platforms reposting #TimesUp imagery from both Reese Witherspoon and Allison Janney. For a similar sequinned style try with a high-street price tag try: Boohoo, Coast or Topshop.   3, Alicia Vikander  Alicia’s stylist, Victoria Sekrier, teamed her custom made black lace Louis Vuitton gown with understated Bulgari jewellery for a super chic look. With her hair sleekly pulled back into a low bun with a classic centre parting Christopher Naselli used his go-to Sun Bum products to keep everything sleek and understated. So flawless! LOOK’s Beauty Writer Gabrielle Dyer shared ‘a low bun is really easy to create. Arm yourself with some hair gel, Aveda’s Confixor Liquid Gel, is lightweight enough that it wont leave your hair feeling sticky – it’s excellent for fine hair too. While it’s still damp, part your hair in the centre and apply your gel. Comb it through and pull it into a tight ponytail at the base of your neck. Twist the pony into a bun and secure using bands and hair pins. Finally, fix the hair in place using a strong hold hairspray like L’Oreal Elnett Supreme Hold Hairspray.’   4,  Emilia Clarke  Emilia’s stylist Petra Flannery had one busy night dressing her many A-List clients for the Golden Globes (Emma Stone in Louis Vuitton, Reese Witherspoon in Zac Posen amongst others!) but it was the Mother of Dragons Miu Miu gown that really stood out on the red carpet. Teaming the dramatic neckline of the Zac Posen gown with classic Harry Winston jewels Petra ensured Emilia’s look really popped. LOOK’s Fashion Editor, Lucie Clifford, recommends following Petra’s styling choices and opting for a low-cut dress with a longer length remarking that ‘I love classic pieces but always like to show off legs or chest. Jumpsuits or longer dresses are great for special occasions save this Asos number for a spring wedding or wear this sunny style now.‘   5, Jessica Biel  An long-time advocate for women’s rights Jessica’s been actively encouraging her followers to ‘join us!’ Sharing her ‘resolution for the year: No more accepting sexual harassment and inequality at work as normal.  It’s NOT normal.’ LOOK’s Chloe Burcham’s shared a full break down of Jessica’s look, including the EXACT lipstick she wore, here. 6, Kerry Washington  Draped and shimmering Kerry’s Prabal Gurung asymmetric dress provided the ultimate red carpet moment. One of the original stars to join the movement Kerry’s been sharing videos online of her with pals, Rashida Jones, Reese Witherspoon and Brie Larson to encourage and update followers on #TimesUp.   7, Zoe Kravitz  Wearing a black velvet column dress by Saint Laurent and show-stopping emerald earrings Zoe stunned on the red carpet. With her dress giving off an almost architectural vibe and conveying strength – the perfect fit for the vibe of The Golden Globes and the movement. Making a major impact with both her words and wardrobe: across social media she divulged ‘I stand with women across every industry to say #TIMESUP on abuse, harassment, marginalization and under-representation.’ Here. Here. The actress took a very special guest on the red carpet with her...  By Isabel Jones From the editors of InStyle US   After a series of Instagram posts supporting the Time’s Up movement, feminist icon and Beauty and the Beast actress Emma Watson took to Golden Globes’ carpet—in black, of course. Watson, 27, rocked her dark brown strands and newly cropped fringe, which she debuted on Instagram this past Friday.     The actress pulled her hair into a low updo for the event, but it wasn’t her hair or even her plunging satin gown that got us talking. The Harry Potter alum brought a special guest with her to the Globes: Marai Larasi, the executive director of Imkaan, a women’s organisation that’s ‘aimed at responding to and preventing violence against black minoritised women and girls.’  ‘When Michelle Williams spearheaded the idea of actresses bringing activists on the red carpet, my first thought was it would be so great to do it with Marai,’ Watson shared with E!’s Ryan Seacrest. As for Time’s Up’s focus on women in Hollywood, Larasi explained that it’s simply an accessible platform to spread their message. ‘There’s something about in women in Hollywood speaking out,’ she said. ‘There is a wall of silence around violence against women and girls and every time somebody speaks out, it just creates a bit of a crack in that wall… ‘We’re saying women in Hollywood have an opportunity to amplify the issues and shine a light,’ she said. We salute you both. Eva Longoria made her first red carpet appearance since confirming her pregnancy at the Golden Globes on Sunday night. See: Golden Globes Dresses -The Red Carpet Pics   Walking the red carpet alongside Reese Witherspoon, Salma Hayek and Ashley Judd, Eva held one hand on her blossoming bump as she posed for photographs.  Of course the mum-to-be was dressed in black, opting for a floor-length gown, as per the dress code.   A proud supporter of the #TIMESUP movement, the Desperate Housewives star joined the protest against sexual harassment in the workplace. ‘This is not a moment, it’s a movement,’ she said on the red carpet. ‘Tonight is just one small part of that.’ Since its launch, Time’s Up has reportedly raised more than $16 million for a legal defence fund, which is set to help people who have experienced workplace harassment. Incredible.   Eva and her husband José Antonio ‘Pepe’ Bastón expect to welcome their first child together this year. A rep for the actress confirmed the exciting news to People back in December, revealing that she is four months along with a baby boy. Amazing. There was a face missing on the red carpet...  By Alexandra Whittaker From the editors of InStyle US   Hollywood descended on the 2018 Golden Globes Sunday night, but there was one notable absence: Anne Hathaway. The actress, who won a Golden Globe back in 2013, did not walk the red carpet during this year’s show. Her reason? She was home sick with an illness. Despite her health, Hathaway still made a point to show support to the stars wearing black for the Time’s Up movement for gender equality by wearing black. Hathaway posted a picture of herself sick and at home while wearing a black dress and throwing up a peace sign.   ‘In Solidarity from my sick bed,’ she wrote, tagging #TIMESUP #WHYWEWEARBLACK and #GoldenGlobes.   Sadly, Hathaway was not the only celebrity spending the Golden Globes under the weather. Olivia Munn also skipped out on the festivities because of the flu but, like Hathaway, that didn’t stop her from standing in solidarity with the movement. ‘I’m staying home today sick with the flu. But so appreciative of everyone who has rallied around to support. I’ll be watching from home,’ she tweeted. We hope they feel better soon. It's fair to say that this year's Golden Globes looked very different...  There’s no denying that the Golden Globes is one of the most prestigious red carpet events of the year. The 2018 red carpet saw a pretty big turnout, with Emma Watson, Dakota Johnson, Angelina Jolie, Margot Robbie, Emma Stone and Kendall Jenner being amongst the attendees.   This time around, A-listers decided to do something a little different with their dresses. Yup, for the first time, the entire carpet was a sea of black. The ‘blacked-out’ dress code was arranged as part of a protest against sexual harassment, after a number of women came forward with allegations against male directors and actors – including shamed producer Harvey Weinstein. Cristina Ehrlich, stylist for the likes of Brie Larson, recently told TIME: ‘I truly believe 2018 will be the era of accountability, and I can’t think of a better way to kick it off…     ‘The red carpet is watched globally and is therefore an incredible platform for and the perfect place for this sort of demonstration. Where in the past the red carpet has been about glitz and glamour, this year it isn’t about standing out, it’s about standing together and speaking out.’ What’s more, a number of A-listers decided to use their plus ones to give a platform to various women activists. Emma Watson walked the carpet with Marai Larasi, the executive director of Black-feminist organisation Imkaan, whilst Meryl Streep invited Ai-jen Poo, the director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance and co-director of the Caring Across Generations Campaign. The 2018 ceremony was held this Sunday (7th January) at the Beverly Hilton Hotel with Seth Meyers as host.   From the editors of InStyle UK If you’re still obsessed with those YSL Niki boots (we know we are), we have some excellent news for you.    Studded with 3,000 rhinestones and first seen on the catwalk in Paris last February, the £6,850 beauties sold out on Net-a-Porter after being spotted on celebrities including Rihanna and Kendall Jenner. But now you can get an amazing dupe… for just £22.     While Primark’s pair come in black sequin instead of silver crystals, they have a matching slouchy fit and length.

From the editors of Marie Claire UK A Prince Harry and Meghan Markle wedding is fast-approaching, with Kensington Palace announcing that the couple are set to wed at Windsor Castle in May 2018.   With the royal couple’s nuptials in sight, many have been wondering what we can expect on the big day – from potential celebrity guests to Prince Harry’s choice of best man – spoiler alert – it might not be Prince William. One of the main questions however is who will be Meghan Markle’s wedding dress designer, with the actress’ most recent photos adding fuel to the fire.     Prince Harry and Meghan Markle released their official engagement portraits yesterday, and the 36-year-old Suits actress surprised us all by breaking one of the Queen’s royal fashion rules, opting to wear a sheer dress by Ralph & Russo. With this in mind people are starting to wonder whether the Canadian actress’ wedding dress may be more risqué than your average royal.   The modern look has certainly gone down well with the public, with Kensington Palace tweeting Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s response to their photo reception.   ‘The couple are so grateful for the warm and generous messages they have received during such a happy time in their lives,’ the palace tweeted before adding, ‘As a way to say thank you, they have decided to share this candid photograph from the day of their portrait sittings directly with all of you.’ We cannot get enough of these two. But all for a very good reason... From the editors of Marie Claire UK A Prince Harry and Meghan Markle wedding is fast-approaching, with Kensington Palace announcing that the couple are set to wed at Windsor Castle in May 2018.   With the royal couple’s nuptials in sight, many have been wondering what we can expect on the big day – from potential celebrity guests to Prince Harry’s choice of best man – spoiler alert – it might not be Prince William. One of the main questions however is who will be Meghan Markle’s wedding dress designer, with the actress’ most recent photos adding fuel to the fire.

The Meghan Markle effect is in full swing. Just when we thought that the world couldn’t get any more obsessed with the prince and his bride-to-be, Kensington Palace released their official engagement portraits – and we were all collectively swooning once more.     The obsession with Meghan’s outfit choices has also hit its peak, with her not-so-traditional (but super sassy) sheer dress becoming a major talking point. What’s more, the Self-Portrait number that she wore to have Christmas lunch with the Queen sold-out almost instantly.   Yup. Everyone wants a piece of Meghan. And it seems as though even the high street is getting involved.  Primark has launched a range of slogan t-shirts, inspired by the Suits actress and the royal engagement. With the slogans ‘Sparkle like Markle’ and ‘I wanna marry Harry’, the retailer shared its new creations in a teaser on social media. A spokesperson for the brand told The Sun: ‘At Primark we take pride in being able to offer our customers an element of excite and delight in every product we sell. ‘A certain loved-up couple has recently stolen the nation’s hearts and now everyone can join in on the fun to celebrate.’ With highly sought-after Primark designs regularly selling out, we don’t think these will hang around for long.

It's a very powerful statement From the editors of Marie Claire UK The Golden Globes 2018 are in touching distance, taking place this year on 7th January in Los Angeles.   As the first event of the packed awards season calendar, the Globes often serves as a forecast for the award shows ahead – predicting everything from who will win the best actor and actress gongs to political stands that will be made across recipient speeches and red carpet appearances.  With the 75th Golden Globe awards nominations announced last week, we already have an idea of what we can expect from 2018’s awards season – big wins from Call Me by Your Name, Lady Bird and I, Tonya – plus a political stand against sexual harassment in Hollywood.   Following in last year’s footsteps, the 2018 awards will serve as a platform for political protest – and while last year’s focus was protesting Trump’s immigration ban – this year will target sexual harassment in Hollywood. The past few months have been consumed by a shocking wave of sexual harassment allegations against Hollywood heavyweights, prompted by the Harvey Weinstein sexual harassment allegations, seeing over 50 women come forward with claims of harassment and in some cases assault against the 65-year-old. Over 50 women have come forward with claims against Harvey Weinstein It was therefore reported today that actresses will be wearing black to the Golden Globe awards in protest – from nominees Jessica Chastain and Meryl Streep to Emma Stone. The protest against sexual assault is also expected to extend past the red carpet during awards season with Kevin Spacey’s award already being revoked and Harvey Weinstein being removed by BAFTA after both faced allegations. We’ll be tuning in on January 7th to see what happens. Words by Megan C.

From the editors of Marie Claire UK Cast your minds back a couple of weeks and you’ll remember Meghan Markle making her first official royal outing with fiancé Prince Harry in Nottingham.   The Suits actress, 36, looked beautiful in a chic navy coat, which she wore with a khaki midi skirt and black suede boots by Kurt Geiger. Tim Rooke/REX/Shutterstock But it was that bag that everyone was talking about – a statement burgundy tote by Strathberry.   As expected, it promptly sold out. In 11 minutes, no less. If you missed out, you’ll be pleased to hear that you’ve still got a chance to snap one up, all while making a sizeable donation to charity. Meghan Markle is now engaged to Prince Harry The Scottish brand (a departure from Meghan’s usual American and Canadian sartorial go-tos) kept one solitary tote back, and are now auctioning it off to raise money for HIV and Aids charity the Terrence Higgins Trust. Poignantly, this was the cause Meghan was supporting in Nottingham.  The original price of the bag is £295 but the auction has already reached £920, so it’s likely it’ll sell for over £1000 more than than its value. The bidding kicked off on Tuesday 12 December on eBay, and is set to run until Sunday 17 December. According to Strathberry’s website, they will be restocking the piece at some point. But if you can’t wait that long and/or want to make a charitable donation, this is the way to go. Good luck!

Words by Brittany Talarico Adriana Lima is one of the most famous lingerie models in the world, and she plans on staying there. The 36-year-old Victoria’s Secret Angel is still working with the brand, despite Internet buzz that she quit her involvement with the lingerie giant.   On Sunday, Lima posted a heartfelt Instagram note saying she would no longer “take off her clothes for empty causes.” Her words sparked some to question whether she would be hanging up her wings for good. But the model, who just walked her 18th Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show in Shanghai in November, will continue to collaborate with the label and was focused on sending a message of female empowerment. “As Adriana mentioned in her post she received a recent offer where she was not aligned with the direction,” a rep for the model tells PEOPLE. “Adriana is blessed to be able to work with all of the brands she does including Victoria’s Secret.”   PEOPLE caught up with the model backstage in China, and she was very emotional and moved by her lengthy tenure at Victoria’s Secret. “I plan to be at 20. Two more years. Maybe more, I don’t know,” she told PEOPLE backstage of her goal to walk in 20 shows with the brand. “It’s nature. I’m working out, I’m being healthy, so let’s see how the body is going to turn out. But I enjoy it. So let’s say 20.” The Brazilian model has become such a spokesperson for the brand, that we’ve dubbed her the “Guardian Angel,” for all the praise she gets from the younger Victoria’s Secret models. “I appreciate to get this kind of respect and love from the girls I work with,” she shared. “We work together. We spend a lot of time doing the show so it’s important that we have this kind of connection with each other. It will show later in the work, when we are on the runway or doing commercials together. I really appreciate this from them.” Prince Harry's fiancée has always been admired for her classic style By Jennifer Davis From the editors of InStyle US   We all know that Meghan Markle was brilliant as Rachel Zane on Suits, but that wasn’t where her high-profile TV career ended. Oh no, in fact, she racked up a slew of on-camera appearances that included everything from being a briefcase girl on Deal Or No Deal to a fashion expert on America’s Today Show. That’s right. To promote her now defunct lifestyle website The Tig, she woke up bright and early to chat fashion with co-host Savannah Guthrie. Thanks to the producers on the morning show, there’s now a video compilation of all the times she appeared on the show as an expert.   During her segments, she discussed everything from cosy winter trends, autumn staples, and the best breezy summer looks. She also advised viewers how to get runway looks for less.   Clearly, her fashion taste has always been great. Case in point: the two on-point ensembles she’s worn since officially becoming engaged to Prince Harry. Thanks to her innate sense of style, she’s quickly become an icon in her own right, and has even beat out future sister-in-law Kate Middleton as the celebrity people want to dress most like in 2017. We have a feeling that her real reign as a fashion expert really is just beginning. Shoppers are pretty upset RN We can always rely on Primark to empty our pockets. After the hair tools that went totally viral and the blanket that practically broke Instagram, we now need this Christmas party-ready playsuit in our wardrobes. Like, right now.   The metallic piece features a plunging neckline and a belt to cinch in the waist, and we haven’t been able to get it out of our heads since it first appeared on our feeds earlier this week.   TBH, we were ready to head to the shops – but then we noticed something pretty upsetting.   The retailer had captioned its image: ‘We are totally crushin’ on this copper playsuit 😍 Prices from €8 (Available in: 🇮🇪 🇫🇷 🇮🇹 🇪🇸 🇵🇹) #Primark #fashion #ootd #weekend.’ And yep, you spotted it. It’s not being sold in the UK. As expected, Primark’s followers are not best impressed. Comments include: ‘Why not in the UK? It’s so perfect 😖😭,’ and: ‘Whyyyyyy is this not available in the uk !!!!! I love this 😭😭😭 not happy primark 🙁 [sic].’ Eep. Fingers crossed Primark take note, because otherwise we have no idea what we’re wearing for New Year’s Eve. The resemblance is uncanny… From the editors of People
Words by Erin Hill For her first official royal outing, Meghan Markle was inspired by ‘American royalty.’   The former Suits star opted for a beige-chino style skirt, a fitted black turtleneck and over-the-knee boots. The ensemble was almost identical to the one Carolyn Bessette Kennedy wore when she was formally introduced to the press by her ‘prince,’ John F. Kennedy Jr. in October 1996. Rex Carolyn was stylish in a camel pencil skirt and a simple fitted black top, which she paired with tall boots. She also carried a black purse with a large handle, just as Meghan did.   ‘It was really intriguing and interesting that she wore a very similar outfit to what Carolyn Bessette wore when we first saw her after she married John,’ Pamela Keogh, author of Audrey Style and Jackie Style, tells PEOPLE. Rex ‘I like that both Carolyn and Meghan have their own style that they had before they met any sort of a public figure, and they’re not afraid to kind of show fresh, young modern style,’ Keogh continues. ‘You don’t get the sense that someone else is dressing them.’ After the newlyweds returned from their honeymoon, Kennedy Jr. formally introduced his new bride to the press and asked them to give her space as she adjusted to her new role in the public eye. ‘I just ask for any privacy or room you could give her as she makes that adjustment. It will be greatly appreciated,’ he told the press outside the couple’s Tribeca loft in N.Y.C. He then returned into the building and reemerged holding hands with his new wife. They stood and posed for photos while fielding a few questions before they got into their car. Sadly, the couple died in a tragic plane crash almost three years later in July 1999. Meghan has admitted to being inspired by Carolyn’s fashion choices in the past. She even called Carolyn’s wedding dress ‘everything goals.’ Style isn’t the only thing the two women share. Just as Kennedy Jr. spoke out in defence of Carolyn’s privacy, so did Prince Harry when he issued a rare statement defending Meghan from the racist and sexist abuse she endured at the start of their relationship in November 2016. ‘Prince Harry is worried about Ms. Markle’s safety and is deeply disappointed that he has not been able to protect her. It is not right that a few months into a relationship with him that Ms. Markle should be subjected to such a storm. He knows commentators will say this is ‘the price she has to pay’ and that ‘this is all part of the game.’ He strongly disagrees. This is not a game — it is her life and his,’ the statement said in part. And it's even cheaper... From the editors of Marie Claire UK
Words by Chloe MacDonnell When Kate Middleton was photographed earlier this week arriving at London’s St. Pancras station in a checked grey coat from Zara, it immediately sold out. It’s hardly surprising – we all know the powers of the Kate Middleton effect.      Plaid, and featuring a lapel collar and an oversized button it’s totally on-trend. Plus as Kate proved, is the type of coat that goes with everything. In her case, she decided to pair it with a grey roll-neck, slim-fit black jeans, black boots and a Polly Push Lock handbag from Mulberry. Simple and chic, no wonder it sold out within hours. However, if you’re still hankering after it we’ve found a similar version and it’s even cheaper.   Say hello to this checked tailored version from River Island. River Island Priced at only £75 it’s of a similar style with neat lapels and a button placket. We need this in our lives. NOW. Let's all take a deep breath, people ASOS definitely has us wrapped around its little finger. First it gave us same day delivery, and then it launched its try before you buy service. Cheers for making us skint just before Christmas, guys. Real helpful.   But not everyone is quite so happy with its latest change. The brand has unveiled a new website, which basically has the whole of Twitter up in arms. So what exactly is different? Well, the design of its shopping pages has been updated, and the navigation bar has been edited to make searching easier. Say hello to the new ASOS site…   However, the quick view functionality has been removed – and people are pretty upset about it. Tweets include: ‘Asos updated the layout of their website and I feel betrayed what have they done its awful there’s no ‘quick view’ anymore?? that’s like online clothes shopping 101,’ and: ‘I’m liking the revamped @ASOS website but why isn’t there quickview anymore?! 😩 [sic].’ Others just can’t get used to the new layout. One shopper wrote: ‘Im irrationally angry at the new ASOS website. I DON’T LIKE CHANGE,’ while another said: ‘What did you do to your website? 🙁 It used to be so easy to use… [sic].’ @ASOS What did you do to your website? 🙁 It used to be so easy to use… — Steph (@ItsStephm_) December 5, 2017   When @ASOS change their website… pic.twitter.com/Otb6REgp1H — Kirstie 🤶🏻 (@AlohaKirstie) December 5, 2017   LOVE the new @ASOS website 😍 — Elaine Malone (@misseblog) December 5, 2017   @ASOS Your new website is cuuuuute! — Kemi Aofolaju (@kemirrobyn) December 5, 2017   Happily for ASOS, there are also plenty of good reviews, such as: ‘LOVE the new @ASOS website 😍,’ and: ‘Your new website is cuuuuute!’ TBH, we get that it can be difficult to adjust to change. But we think everyone should just give it time. And let’s be honest, nothing’s ever gonna stop us shopping on ASOS. Because that’s a life-long addiction right there. Whether you're a real life Disney Princess or a massive Star Wars fan, this will be music to your ears...  STOP EVERYTHING. Primark may have just fulfilled all of our festive dreams. Just when we thought the high street hotspot might be all out of wonderful Disney-related ideas – we mean, we just didn’t think they’d be able to top the Beauty and the Beast lamp, or the PJ set that had over 200,000 Instagram likes – they’ve announced something that’s sent us into a real tizzy.   Primark has only gone and launched a customisation station, just in time for Christmas. The much-loved retail giant has rolled it out in their Oxford Street East store, and you can choose from two designs – Disney or Star Wars.    A whole host of characters – including a very festive Mickey Mouse, and a not-so-festive Darth Vader – are included, along with different slogans and a number of patterns. What’s more, you can even add a completely customised message of your very own. WE KNOW. True to form, Primark are keeping their prices low – with each tee costing just £8 for an adult, or a mere fiver for kids’ sizes. Basically, we want some Disney merch with our name on it, STAT. We predict that there’ll be MAHOOSIVE queues, so it’s probably best to get in there quick. We're in LOVE with this look... We’re not gonna lie, we’re a teeny bit obsessed with Meghan Markle and Prince Harry RN. The couple announced their engagement yesterday, and later recorded their first TV interview together.   See: Meghan Markle’s Engagement Ring Has A Very Special Hidden Meaning  They spoke about Harry’s proposal, which Suits actress Meghan, 36, revealed happened as they roasted a chicken at home. She said: ‘It was just an amazing surprise. It was so sweet, and natural and very romantic.’   Harry, 33, continued: ‘She didn’t even let me finish. She said: “Can I say yes?” Then there were hugs and I had the ring on my finger. ‘I was like: “Can I give you the ring?” It was a really nice moment. Just the two of us.’ Meghan had earlier covered up in a white coat When asked how he thinks his late mother Princess Diana would have reacted to the news, Harry sad: ‘Oh they’d be thick as thieves, without question, I think she would be over the moon, jumping up and down, you know so excited for me, but then, as I said, would have probably been best friends – best friends with Meghan.’ See: Prince Harry And Meghan Markle Just Made Their First Public Appearance As An Engaged Couple Of course, Meghan looked absolutely stunning (and adorable, gazing lovingly at her new fiancé). How BEAUT were Meghan Markle’s shoes? She’d opted for a dark green crew-neck dress by P.A.R.O.S.H, which is priced at €490 on its website (around £437). She’d paired the piece with nude suede pumps by Aquazurra (£369) and £850 Les Plaisirs de Birks earrings. We’re in love with her look, but TBH, it’s a little pricey.

Available in allyour classic neutrals (black, grey, navy and co) to bold brights  – think everything from dusky pink and mustard yellow to khaki green and shiny silver.

When it comes to logo tees, generally, they’re either designer, incredibly expensive and therefore totally out of our reach (Sure, we love ‘em, but £600 plus for a designer tee?). See: The Slogan T-Shirt Bound To Sell Out   Or, they can often be cheap and as a result, pretty uncomfy and not-so-flattering. Plus, when investing in a novelty tee, it’s always wise to consider how much you’re actually going to wear it (read: twice, maximum). See: The Dress Everyone Wanted Is Back In Stock   ‘FORNEVER’, however, ticks all the right boxes. The shape is chic, the colours are actually wearable (hello, millennial pink) and we’re betting these achingly cool tees will look every bit as cool tucked into high-rise jeans and trainers on the weekend as they would worn with a vinyl skirt, tights and ankle boots for a night out. Still not convinced? Head over to the site fornever.co.uk and see for yourself just how fun they really are.   Trick or Treat! Our favourite holiday of the year is nearly here.

We’ve searched high and low for the best in celeb inspiration so you don’t spend the scariest night of the year as a cat, again.

Or Paris Hilton as, er, Miley Cyrus? Not forgetting Heidi Klum’s fantastic granny costume.   If you’re scared to go it alone why not team up with a friend and do the double? Look to Kendall and Cara for inspo who dressed up as the Mario Brothers, or how about Millie Mac and Pro Green who went as matching skeletons. Ahh. Don’t want to give up your fashionable credentials. Take a leaf out of Kelly Osborne’s book and dress up as this season’s surprise style icon, Margot Tenenbaum.

Jemima Khan was also in attendance at the UNICEF Halloween ball, dressing up as a gorilla's hostage. Top marks for originality. Jamie Campbell Bower isn't one to miss an opportunity to show off his style credentials, so he matched his spooky makeup with a sharp Victorian style suit, as he hit the UNICEF Ball with girlfriend Matilda Lowther.

You’ll see why… So, we all remember those mermaid blankets that literally everyone had on their Xmas wish-lists last year, right? Of course you do. Well, you’re in for a treat thanks to the babes at Primark. They’ve recently launched the Disney collection of hooded blanket you can actually walk around the house wearing, yup, finally this creation has been made. And, there’s no forgetting the unicorn blanket complete with horned hood and mittens that literally took over our Insta feeds.     See: Everyone Is Obsessing Over These Primark Blankets But, that’s nothing compared to their most recent blanket that is literally so EXTRA we can’t even cope.   The mermaid tail has come to life in all over iridescent sequins and OMG it is everything. Because wearing a life size mermaid tail isn’t statement enough, sprinkle it with sequins and it takes it to a whole new level. Say hey to your next  #OOTD Insta post, guys. See: The Primark Dress Edit Since Primark posted it on their Insta feed it’s racked up a casj 60,000 likes in 4 days, proving just how quickly this winner is going to sell out. We can’t wait to embrace our inner Ariel and swish our tails around in our living room whilst watching X Factor. The dream. Obvs. Get the blanket everyone is after in store at Primark, now. Note: shell bra unfortunately not included. The This Morning presenter looked gorgeous on the red carpet at the star-studded event...  Some of our favourite celebrity names stepped out to celebrate the Pride Of Britain Awards on Monday night, including This Morning‘s Holly Willoughby. The ITV presenter has become a firm-favourite when it comes to red carpet glamour, and last night was no exception.   See: Liam Payne Spills A Secret About Cheryl At The Pride Of Britain Awards  Holly opted for a beautiful floor-length number in a lilac hue. The couture gown, designed by George Shobeika, featured a thigh-high slit and nude cut-out detail, as well as some sparkling embellishments.   Sharing a photograph of her evening look with her Instagram followers, the TV personality wrote: ‘Time for one of my favourite nights of the year @prideofbritain…   ‘💜 Lilac dress of dreams ✨ thank you @georgeshobeika for the most beautiful gown for tonight’s Pride Of Britain Awards [sic]’. Holly accessorised with some strappy silver heels and some statement drop earrings, twisting her blonde locks into a glamorous updo.   Looking beaut, lady. Having walked the carpet, the mum-of-three met with the London Fire Brigade, who were awarded for their courage during the tragedy at Grenfell tower.   Posting a backstage snap to Instagram, the star announced: ‘Honoured to stand shoulder to shoulder with the heroic firefighters of the @londonfirebrigade Awarded last night for their bravery at the horrific Grenfell fire… hugely deserved, we can not thank you enough. ‘Also… Commissioner Dany Cotton … what an amazing lady you are, that’s true girl power! Xxx [sic]’.   And that wasn’t the only meet-and-greet that Holly enjoyed on the big night – as she also came face-to-face with Prince William. ‘So this happened last night… thank you @prideofbritain for what is always a magical night [sic],’ she gushed, alongside a photograph of the moment. Aw. It seems as though even the TV stars get star-struck, eh? You won’t want to miss this… This cosmic print dress is a hot-ticket item. And when we say hot-ticket, that loosely translates to the ultimate street style-approved frock that flew off the shelves so fast, even the savviest of shoppers completely missed out. And it’s no wonder. We can’t say whether it’s down to the midnight starry print, the perfect midi length, those full length sleeves or the price tag – but what we do know is that this ticks all the right boxes and not only that, it’s universally flattering. What’s not to love?     See: You Don’t Want To Miss The M&S Black Friday Sale It’s not the first time M&S has turned out such a stellar dress – remember that fuchsia ruffle sleeve dress-of-dreams? – but this frock has reached cult status. Why? It was quickly adopted by some of the best dressed style bloggers, which naturally saw the designer-style frock sell out everywhere, in every single size.   Don’t feel too bad if you didn’t manage to get your hands on one, though. We like to think of ourselves as dedicated shoppers here at LOOK HQ, so dedicated in fact, that we pride ourselves on spotting such winning buys a mile off. And trust us when we say, even we couldn’t get our hands on this one.  Dress, £45, Marks and Spencer See: 12 Pretty Winter Dresses To Covet If like us, you missed out, there’s good news all round. M&S has announced a second drop on the 6th November. Bookmark this date RN. This time around, we plan to be first in line to avoid a second round of disappointment. And if you’re also obsessed with securing one, we’d suggest you do the same. How to wear yours once it’s safely in your wardrobe? The styling options are endless. On it’s own with heels and a bold red lip this is undoubtedly the coolest party look, but those savvy street stylers have proved it has serious mileage and looks every bit as chic during the day when layered under cosy knits with knee high boots, too.   This dress has the power to totally overhaul your winter wardrobe. Be sure to snap one up on the 6th November. Party heels have the capacity to make or break an outfit. Whether they’re the centerpiece of your outfit and everything else works around what you’re wearing on your feet, or you’re looking for a pair that will go with all of your party outfits but are still just as on-trend and fabulous as everything else you’re wearing, party heels are a very important part of autumn/winter shopping. As well as the way they look, there’s comfort to think about too- party heels don’t just need to last the whole night long, they need to be comfortable enough for you to dance the whole time, too. See? A lot to think about, isn’t there? To make matters worse, the amount of party heels on the high street right now is pretty over-whelming, so we’ve decided to do the hard work and pick the best pairs for you. If you’re after a timeless pair that will go with all your party outfits, black is a no-brainer. Choose an amped-up pair in satin or with embroidery, or keep things plain and wear in the office, too.     SEE: Best Party Dresses: The Look Edit     Going all out? Sequin party heels are the ultimate statement-maker, and you won’t even need to think about the rest of your outfit. Just keep things simple elsewhere to avoid looking more costume than couture. Strappy party heels aren’t just for summer. If you like the style, opt for darker colours like black or red to take it into the party season.   There are plenty of styles to choose from, and while the high street has them all, they’re so affordable, you’ll be able to go on even more nights out than you thought. The party’s only just getting started. And it's going to be perfect for all of those Christmas parties...  Oh, Primark. You simply make us fall in love over and over again. As if this year’s selection of Primark Christmas jumpers wasn’t enough to have us parting with our dollar dollar, one look at the high street hotspot’s Instagram page has got us filling up our wishlist. Fast.   See: Christmas Gift Ideas For Her And one of Primark’s latest posts seems to have got a lot of people excited. Now, if you’ve been on the lookout for the perfect statement bag to accompany you to all of your social engagements this party season – because, let’s face it, we’ve already resigned to the fact that we’ll be ditching our gym classes and cosy nights in front of the TV in favour of ALL the Christmas drinks – we’ve found something for you.     Available in three different styles (which include glittery shades and a cute velvet number), Primark’s new mini collection of bags have already racked up over 44,000 likes and almost 500 comments – most of them with users tagging their friends to share the love. See: The Best Primark Bags You’re Going To Fall For Comments include: ‘I want the one with the little love bug’, ‘how cute are these 😍’ and ‘I need this blue bag!’ Complete with gold hardware, a tassel feature and an adorable bug fastening, the blue bag certainly seems to be the stand-out of the bunch. But we certainly wouldn’t say no to the sparkly silver or pretty pink design either. And at just £7, we might be tempted to bag all three of them. Race you to the checkout. Once again, eagle-eyed fans of the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star think they've found a clue about her rumoured 'pregnancy'...  By Gabriela Herstik From the editors of HelloGiggles   In one of the most intriguing mysteries of the year, pop culture icon and makeup queen Kylie Jenner has left us wondering one thing: Is she, or is she not, pregnant? While the youngest Jenner hasn’t officially spoken up about the rumour, she has been leaving us potential clues, via her Instagram and Snapchat, about the possibility of being pregnant. See: Kylie Jenner’s Latest Outfit Has Fuelled ‘Pregnancy’ Speculation   Kylie’s latest hint is a necklace made of baby blocks that comes from her rumoured baby daddy, Travis Scott.   This – paired with pink and blue phone cases and talks of having ‘so many babies’ – is making us seriously think that Kylie is either pregnant or really good at teasing us into believing she is. Kylie posted a late-night snap of her in a hat complete with Snapchat filter bunny ears. We’re used to her late-night snaps, but this one caught our attention — thanks to the necklace she’s wearing.  Written on the piece of jewellery is ‘Cactus Jack,’ which is the name of Travis Scott’s record label. And weirdly enough, the name is spelled out in children’s alphabet blocks. While this cryptic snap doesn’t tell us for sure whether or not Kylie is actually pregnant, we can’t help but speculate, especially since said necklace comes from Travis Scott. Along with the other half-dozen clues she’s dropped, we wouldn’t be surprised if the pregnancy announcement came at any moment. Until then, we’ll be stalking Kylie’s social media to see any other clues she may drop. QUICK Words by Megan C.

Halloween is the one time of year we all get to dress up without any judgement or funny looks. That’s why Halloween costumes are so important. They’re so important because if you mess it up, you’ve got another 364 days to wait until you can try again. To help you out then, we’ve already put together the best celebrity Halloween costumes to look to for inspiration, and now we’ve taken on the task of finding the best to buy on the high street. The result? 10/10.   We’ll start with the more obvious options. Want to go as a skeleton? Head to Missguided for the sleekest skeleton jumpsuit we’ve ever come across. Yes, skeletons can be sleek, and yes, this one will only cost you £18. Cheerleader? H&M’s black and white co-ord is the perfect cheerleader costume for minimalists. And we couldn’t go without finding the ultimate catsuit- Boohoo’s leopard style is one that’ll work this year and next. SEE: The Best Celebrity Halloween Costumes As for newer ideas, there’s everything from gypsy costumes to mermaid dresses. Snap up Pretty Little Thing’s gypsy costume and complete with face jewels, or choose George at Asda’s mermaid dress and take things one step further with blue hair spray. You know you want to. All in all then, there’s something for everyone in the high street’s Halloween offering- and as if the styles aren’t enough, we’ve kept everything under £35. No tricks here… And we can see why… Disney fans rejoice, there’s yet another addition you can make to your ever-growing collection of Disney merchandise and this one is a sure-fire winner. Anything Primark does is bound to go viral, and yep their launch of the blanket/hoody hybrid has done just that.       They’ve already made a unicorn style that yep you guessed it, basically sold out immediately and had to be restocked, but now they’ve headed to our fave Disney characters to bring us yet even more joy.   See: The Unicorn Hooded Blanket Is Here  There’s a Minnie Mouse style with a little red bow on the hood, a Daisy Duck print complete with a duck beak hood, of course. And our all time fave – the Thumper blanket that we are literally in love with. Because who doesn’t want to walk around the house with little bunny ears? See: The LOOK Primark Dress Edit   Whichever one you go for, they’re all available right now in Primark stores nationwide for just £16. Basically avoid those morning coffees for a few days and you can buy one with your savings. We can’t wait to get snug in our hooded blanket with a hot choc and a Disney film, obvs. Which one to go for though is the question? Maybe we’ll make it a marathon as a Sunday lazy day treat. We predict a sell-out, run to your nearest Primarni immediately… It's time Primark Christmas jumpers are here and as far as we’re concerned it’s not a minute too soon. If like us, the arrival of said festive knits marks the (very early) start of the season, here’s what you need to know about the best Christmas jumpers of all time. Much like last year, there’s a reason they come out on top when it comes to the holiday season with Primark Christmas decorations and no end of amazing Christmas jumpers. Penguins, gingerbread men, reindeer – they’re all in there. Plus, there’s always lashings of sparkle (hello, sequin candy canes), with a fair amount of fair isle and usually for the dedicated novelty knit fans, a subtle amount of LED lighting. So far, so fun, then?   If you’re still not convinced about just how chic Christmas jumpers can be, let us reassure you they’re not the frowned upon piece they once were. Victoria Beckham is one of many A-Listers to give the crimbo knit the fashion seal-of-approval and let’s face it, it doesn’t get better than that. SEE: The Best Christmas Jumpers To Buy Now Sure, it could technically be seen as a little early to start stockpiling such styles when they’re perhaps not going to get much wear until November at the earliest, but last year’s collection flew off the shelves and visual rails at lightening speed and we’re predicting a similar reaction this year, too.   And with only 88 days to go until the big day (yes, really), we’re avoiding such shopping disappointment and snapping-up a hot-ticket style, stat. What’s charting as the LOOK team’s favourite? We’re torn between the chic black crew neck with rainbow baubles and the traditional powder blue fair isle offering. Prices, as ever, are purse-friendly meaning we’re probably going to buy both, and wear on rotation from now until January. Click through to meet (and shop) the Primark christmas jumper collection. Get ready to want EVERYTHING... Fash jewels come and go, just think of the bangles we used to pick up from Toppers and pile up our arms, or the plastic tattoo choker (yes, it may have made a comeback recently but doesn’t mean you should get on board) but sometimes you want a forever piece that you can make your staple wear and bring out again and again.     Enter: the second collab with Missoma x mega influencer Lucy Williams and if you don’t already follow her on Insta, prepare to want to double tap a hundred times and shop her entire ‘drobe. It’s @lucywilliams02, FYI…you’re welcome!  Necklace, £85, Lucy Williams x Missoma   Earrings, £159, Lucy Williams x Missoma So the first collection created mass social media hysteria with the now somewhat iconic horn style necklace we ALL have or still want, and now the second drop inspired by Lucy’s travels to Rome create a whole new lust-list. Since the launch everyone has been going mad over the new offerings of coin necklaces, signature rings and earrings you’ll be able to pass off as high-end designer.   It’s no surprise other mega blogger pals are jumping on the magical Missoma bandwagon and getting some pieces for themselves, and when the likes of Tanya Burr approve, you know it’s a winner.  Earrings, £149, Lucy Williams x Missoma Necklace, £145, Lucy Williams x Missoma The wear anywhere, anytime, anyhow jewellery pieces are so beautiful they’re guaranteed to take over your Xmas wish list. Best part is, layering them is the perfect way to wear – useful seen as we want the whole lot, eh! Want to know our fave piece? These hoop earrings are a day-to-night dream. They may be more on the spenny side, but you’ll wear them so much the cost-per-wear will be mere pennies. Add them to your basket pronto, we predict a sure-fire sell-out. We're already obsessed... We’re calling it – this sassy phone case is going to sell out, fast. It’s quite literally, the coolest tech accessory we’ve seen this year. See: Everyone Is Going Crazy Over This Primark iPhone Phone Case   That may sound a touch dramatic, but hear us out. Those clever designers over at Edie Parker have teamed up with goo.ey. to combine Edie’s super-stylish accessory design skills with oh-so-savvy suction technology. The result? An iPhone case that actually sticks to the wall or mirror. Yes, you read that right. And It’s just so simple, we can’t believe we haven’t thought of it (read: searched tirelessly for it) sooner. So what does that mean? Basically, you can now stick your phone to the wall or mirror, and snap away in the changing room, or why not enjoy a little hands-free face time with your BFF? Either way, you won’t be getting the dreaded selfie dead arm any time soon.   See: This Is Officially The Most Flattering Selfie Angle And that’s not the best part. Fashion fans will well be aware that Edie Parker is the street style-approved accessory label to be seen with. Those acrylic monogram clutch bags have been taking over our Insta feeds for longer than we can remember, and costing a cool £1,295 plus for the basic box clutch means said styles have been way out of our reach. Until now. This £40 case may be more than we’d usually spend on an iPhone accessory, but boy are they worth it. Choose between the all-white quartz-effect case with gold lettering, the jet black ‘Hello’ style or our favourite, the rainbow stripes topped with your initial – we’re betting this’ll upgrade your phone and your mood in one. And there’s no escaping the impending festive season and the gift buying dread that comes with it, so whether you’re on the lookout for something statement, or looking to leave some not-so-subtle hints for your nearest and dearest – we think this comes out on top. Genius. Scroll below to shop the lot…   Edie Parker iPhone + goo.ey. case, £40  Edie Parker + goo.ey. iPhone case, £40  Edie Parker + goo.ey. iPhone case, £40 And you can still get it too... When Topshop speaks, we all need to listen, and this season it’s all about the blazer. Yup, the office fave is moving to the forefront of fash and it’s about to go statement.     No longer just in a pinstripe or a yawn charcoal grey, it’s about about bright sassy hues that’ll get you noticed for all the right reason. We’re looking at you mustard blazer-of-actual-dreams. The street style set are using the #TopshopStyle hashtag a million (ok, slight exaggeration) times to show off this one, and you can see why they’re winning at life. The autumn hue is all you need to step in to new season in serious style, and it’s the perfect shade to brighten up your vitamin D lacking skin at this time of year.

Either way it’s a win-win, but we have some sad news – it’s sold out online *sob* But wait, we’re not about to tell you how amazing something is that’s no longer available, lucky for us all it’s still available in most stores, and a little Toppers birdy has told us it’s getting restocked online, too.

You can finally take your trainer obsession to the next level now that one of our fave brands has announced a sassy new customising tool. Yes, Vans now lets you personalise your kicks. See: This Is How To Keep Your White Trainers Clean   Chances are you already own one (or two) pairs already, perhaps even more since style supremo, Kate Foley, wore her classic black and white high top iteration on repeat during fashion month. Which, much like any street-style-approved accessory, made Vans take the top spot on the trainer scene.    And don’t get us wrong, we’ll always rely on said staple trainers – because a slip-on-and-go, wear-with-everything trainer is an essential part of any wardrobe – but there’s nothing we love more than a little personalisation, right?   See: These Are The Best Black Friday Trainer Deals Start by picking your shoe. Sound simple? You’ll be hard pushed to choose between the many styles on offer (Classic, Old Skool, Slip-On, Authentic – you get the idea).  Once you’ve done the hard part, it’s time to start customising. Colour, pattern, lining, lacing and even the sole – you’ve got free rein to get seriously creative.  Keep yours ultra-chic and all-white with a subtle update, or go all-out and embrace your inner maximalist – either way, you’re highly unlikely to spot anyone else wearing exactly the same pair anytime soon. And that’s not all. This is not just limited to womens styles. Looking for a unique Christmas gift for your best pal? Something fun for kids? Maybe a gift for him? This is hands down the ultimate gift choice for trainer fans and they’re guaranteed to impress. Sound good? Check out Vans Customs and start designer yours, stat. From 80p... Christmas decorations are one of, if not the, best thing about the festive season. Obviously there’s the presents, and Christmas films- if you haven’t seen Elf, you haven’t lived- and then there’s the food. The mince pies, the Yule log, the turkey- we’re getting excited just thinking about it. When it comes to Christmas decorations though, the idea of decking our houses out in tinsel, putting up the tree and lighting all the candles is what we’re really looking forward to this year. Why? Because none other than Primark has unveiled its collection and it might well be the best Christmas decoration collection we’ve ever come across. If you’ve seen their year-round homeware range and Primark Christmas jumpers, you’ll have an idea of how good this one is set to be, but trust us when we say it’s even better.   SEE: Best Primark Homeware We’d usually save the best bit ‘til last, but in the spirit of Christmas, we thought we’d give you an early gift: the new Primark Christmas decorations start from just 80p. Yes, really. That’s less than your daily coffee. Roughly a quarter if we’re going to be precise. SEE: The Best Christmas Jumpers For Snuggly Season   So what’s on offer? If you’re a minimalist, choose Primark’s silver Christmas tree star, and snap up the espresso martini, strawberry prosecco and chocolate orange scented candles. Going all out? Primark even offers up Christmas bedding featuring gingerbread men, Christmas trees and candy canes. There’s a fleece snowflake throw to keep out in the living room, too. As for tree decorations, they always make great affordable Christmas gifts for her or Christmas gifts for him and there’s more than enough to choose from- think knitted santas and bottle green baubles. All that from just 80p- Christmas really has come early. All hail Primark Christmas decorations. So simple... We all love a pair of white trainers. But keeping them that way? It’s no mean feat. Luckily, there’s a new hack to ensure your trophy kicks remain box fresh for longer.   This genius solution means you can wear those beloved Stan Smith’s on repeat, because once they’ve lost their newness (and let’s face it, even the most careful wearer can’t keep theirs fresh for long) you can simply give them the Twitter-inspired once-over thanks to this top trick. See: Black Friday Trainer Deals To Bookmark Now Twitter user @sarahtraceyy explained her simple hack and it’s so easy you’ll wonder why you didn’t think of it sooner.   She explains, ‘Rinse shoes, mix 1:1.5 of baking soda & detergent, scrub w toothbrush, let it sit for a while, rinse, put in washer, baby powder/dry’. Got it? Good. So all you need is a quick mix of said cleaning products, throw ‘em in the wash, sprinkle a little baby powder and voila. Squeaky clean sneakers with minimal effort, and minimal spend. It’s a win-win. See: This Is Officially The Most Searched Trainer We’ve all no doubt attempted (and failed) to give our fave trainers a refresh once before (wet wipe, tooth paste, CIF – you name it, we’ve definitely tried it) but there’s no arguing with this clever method. To back her game-changing hack, an impressive before and after snap was uploaded, captioned ‘I am a miracle worker’. And we couldn’t agree more. The well-worn pair of Converse had clearly seen better days –a familiar sight for most, no doubt – and the after shot was so impressive, and such a transformation, it left us racing to the nearest supermarket to stock up and try it out for ourselves. I am a miracle worker pic.twitter.com/BeivqBtdrv — halloween queen (@sarahtraceyy) October 15, 2017   Still not convinced? Try it today and totally transform your trainers in time for the weekend. Everyone has a lot of say about them… There’s many trends that come and go that we all know just weren’t meant to stick around, like the return of the chain mail crop top for example (soz Paris Hilton circa 2002) but there’s some that just shouldn’t happen in the first place (we’re looking at you Topshop suspender jeans, yep really!) Zara has to be the Queen of shoes and this time they’re making there own hybrid to make our lives that little bit easier…    Shoes, £55.99, Zara All the street style set are obsessing over the socks and shoes combo, so Zara has made a new way to wear them with their court heels that already have a sock attached – yep, this is happening and we can’t help but actually want a pair.   But we have 1 very important question, how would you ever wash your socks? We don’t know the answer to this, but we do know that if we can save on doing laundry then we’re 100% sold. Zara aren’t the only high street giants that have been daring in the wardrobe department, Topshop has been getting quite a few tweets about their most recent pair of jeans, but is it a denim update too far? We’ll let you be the judge of that…   The mom jean can be a tricky one to pull off with their baggy leg and tight in some may say all the wrong places style making them unforgiving. But, what would make them even trickier is if you throw in some suspenders in to the mix. And we can only imagine this is the challenge the design team at Toppers wanted to set. They’re a hybrid between denim shorts and those denim thigh highs we’ve all seen Kim K sporting, and well, there are no words. Apart from, is there really any need for chilly thighs? We think not.   We’ve also spotted some other trends on the high street that are making us have a little lol, and these include Zara’s mismatch mules. Yep, that’s right you actually buy a pair of odd shoes, and wear them together. The street stylers have been doing it so apparently it’s a thing. Well, our nan has been known to leave the house wearing an odd pair so maybe she’s more stylish than we originally thought? But, again, we’ll let you be the judge of that. See: LOOK’s Bridesmaid Dress Edit  And one last one, Lazy Oaf’s pink furry dog face jacket with love heart buttons. Yep, you read that right. All of the above are part of one coat that’s available at Asos for, wait for it…£200. At least it’ll get you noticed, right? See: The Affordable Collection You’ll 100% Want Now  Enjoy the LOL on us. Promotional feature with Timberland The ultimate cool-girl boots have arrived… Nothing says ‘autumn’ quite like new boots in your wardrobe and this season, Timberland has nailed casual-chic with its fab new #CourmayeurValley boot – in stores and online now!   One of the best things to grace the Autumn/Winter 17 style pool, it’s fast turning the heads of all the fashion mavens and It Girls we care about. ‘One wear of these boots and I didn’t want to take them off,’ says Look Acting Editor Maxine Eggenberger. ‘They’re so comfy and go with everything. Talk about a hero shoe!’ Basically the love child of a hiking and city boot, Courmayeur combines smooth leather with a rugged sole that raise the casual fashion quality bar much higher – making it the perfect star of your next #OOTD post.    As the go-to brand for outdoor and casual style, Timberland has always kept its eye on quality materials, and this new release is no exception. Its Courmayeur boot is designed to be super comfortable and lightweight, with built-in OrthoLite™ technology to keep your feet comfy #Praise!  For the remainder of your sunny brunches, pair the boot with a patchwork maxi dress, statement hoops and a bold red lip. Then, when the weather turns, the boot will work flawlessly with your vintage wash jeans and a super cosy knitted jumper or trench coat for a chic layered autumnal look. For more expert style tips, be sure to join us at the Timberland X Look event happening at London’s Regent Street store on 1 November from 7-9pm, for a braid bar, gif booth, goodie bags and more.

Mango bra, £19.99, and briefs, £12.99 Simple, lace-trimmed designs come in a handful of pretty shades – think berry, mustard, navy and even emerald green – alongside those easy everyday basic shades we can’t be without (grey marl, white, black – they’re all in there, too). And the best part? The price point. You can snap-up a pair of briefs for just £9.99, and top off the lingerie look with a matching bra from just £17.99. Match ‘em up or wear solo – there’s nothing better than a posh pair of new undies, right?

 The trainer and influencer is a bride-to-be! 👰 It's spookily good... We’ve been on the Halloween countdown since summer tbh, but now we literally can’t contain our excitement. We may be too old for trick-or-treating, boo, but this means instead we can get dressed up and go out instead of waiting to hand out chocolate, which in reality we would have eaten by the time anyone actually gets to the door anyway.    Skeleton dress, £12.99, New Look So, what to go as this year? A basic witch? A CBA cat? Or maybe just a Wednesday Addams all black kinda vibe? The possibilities are endless, but New Look has just made your life a whole lot easier with their one-stop-shop. Cheers, guys!   They’ve dedicated a whole section on their website especially to Halloween and it’s taken any stress away from knowing what to actually wear. Amazing, right? And you can shop it right now, here.  Pumpkin bunting, £4.99, New Look There’s hundreds of spooky pieces, from skeleton dresses to bunting for your p.a.r.t.y and want to know the best part? The collection starts from just £1.75. Yup, really See: This Is The Scariest Halloween Make Up Ever  Red over the knee boots, £44.99, New Look If you don’t want to go all out and get a proper costume then you can just get some of this season’s hottest buys and style them up. These red thigh highs will see you through Halloween night, and beyond. See: Best Halloween Costumes On The High Street    Face paint kit, £4.99, New Look And if in doubt, just add face paint, obvs. Black lips are an instant win so just add this to your outfit and voila, you’ll be instantly Halloween-ready. If you’ve got it haunt it, girls…Happy Halloween! Zara wins (again)... Another season, another cult buy to covet. It can feel like week in, week out there’s a new ‘must-have’ item taking over our Instagram feeds, and unsurprisingly, nine times out of ten, said uh-mazing item is from Zara.  Have a nice day😘 OUTFIT by @zebrafashion_official •  #welovezebra #zara #zarawoman #zaraboots #style #mylook #mystyle #daily #dailyoutfit #streetstyle #autumn #autumnoutfit #danielwellington A post shared by JUDI (@ju.st.style) on Oct 12, 2017 at 2:44am PDT     See: Zara Has A Hidden Section You Need To See (And Shop) Stat Today’s hero piece that’s got us all racing to the virtual checkout is the classic biker boot with a new-season Zara twist. The black lace-up boot is adorned with pearl detailing for autumn, and they’re set to totally transform your off-duty wardrobe in a flash.    Zara Biker Boots, £89.99 The street style set have been spotted wearing theirs on repeat, styling them up with everything from super-sized knitwear to floaty floor-grazing frocks and high-rise jeans, which tells us (aside from the obvious, that this is the boot to be seen in RN) that these are super-versatile and well worth the spend.   See: The Must-Have Winter Coats In Zara Right Now We’ve been cheerleaders for tough-looking boots for some time, and we can guarantee these are going to get maximum wear. They’re quite literally going to be your go-to boot now, and long into next season, too. Why? Comfort wins. We’ll always be firm fans of a sky-high heel, and sure, a sock boot is one of our fave new breakout trends this year, but a fancy flat ankle boot you can wear any which way, any day of the week gets the green light from us. If the chunky boot just isn’t your thing, nod to the flat boot trend and check out the many (many) options in Zara right now, most with a pearl topping or an equally chic add on to transform the humble biker boot into something far cooler in a flash. Buy now, wear forevermore. We’re obsessed… We can always rely on Mango for winning wardrobe buys that won’t blow the budget, and just when we thought we’d bookmarked them all, another standout separate pops up. Yes, Mango is the latest high street brand to give us exactly what we want right now. And we want corduroy trousers. You could easily be forgiven for questioning the coolness of cords. Think cord and you’ll probably picture ill-fitting, unflattering pieces and that’s ok. We’re also betting this is not something that’s high on your new-season shopping list. But trust us, this unexpected trend is dominating on Instagram with every street styler worth their salt stepping out in a pair.     See: 6 Standout Buys In The Mango Mid-Season Sale What’s the easiest and chicest way to channel the trend? By slipping into Mango’s updated corduroy trouser, of course.   First, Mango’s pink cord trouser totally floored us. Sure, it’s not the easiest shade to pull off, but this new iteration has a high-rise, wide leg shape (hello, nipped-in waist) and they come in the perfect autumnal shade, that’s ideal for pairing with all those grey and navy knits you’ve been stockpiling ahead of the impending chilly weather.   See: The Simple Mango Accessory Everyone Is Obsessing Over They can be all yours for £69.99, which may feel a little spenny, but when it comes to nailing this tricky trend, it pays to get the fit right (read: avoid looking like a geography teacher). So, how exactly do you style such a divisive piece? On the catwalks, Isabel Marant, Prada and Marc Jacobs sent sassy styles down the runway, confirming what we already know – cords are officially in. Take your cue from the street style set and the catwalks, where roll neck knitwear was layered over cord trousers, or why not go for maximum impact and wear yours with the equally chic matching blazer? Just add a crew neck black knit, pointed white boots and a suitably statement earring and you’re good to go. Mango corduroy trousers, £69.99 We’re predicting these will sell out fast, so bag yourself a pair to avoid missing out. You need to see this… Love Mollie King? Looking for a little sartorial pick-me-up? We’re betting you’re going to love this. Strictly star and style supremo, Mollie King has found time in between rehearsals and her incredibly hectic schedule to pair up with Littlewoods to showcase their achingly cool new collection. It’s just landed online, and it’s just in time for party season.    Packed full of glittering party dresses alongside a number of other winning wardrobe updates, this collection essentially has your AW17 wardrobe all sewn up. See: 16 Party Dresses You’ll Want Now   Explaining her reasons for teaming up with the brand on this new collaboration, the 30-year-old says ‘I’ve been a big fan of Littlewoods for a while now; it’s such a standout brand offering products that are stylish yet affordable. Littlewoods.com truly caters to every body shape, style and budget. I really enjoyed modelling their last SS17 collection so I am really excited to have the opportunity to model their latest AW17 collection.’ And we couldn’t agree more. If you’re after a coat in a punchy new-season shade or a chunky autumnal knit set to amp up your hero denim – you’re going to find a number of styles that tick all the right boxes, here.  Expect to pay between £30-£185 for a slice of the Mollie King-approved action, with sizes ranging from 6-16. And should you need any further inspo on exactly how to style up your new purchases, Mollie shared her guide to getting it right. See: You’ll Love This New Littlewoods Collection  On finding the perfect party outfit, Mollie tells LOOK ‘I really like to experiment with my going out style, but you can’t go wrong with a good sequin dress perfect for those festive parties. I’m a firm believer in dressing for your body shape rather than wearing what is on trend. I think a standout bodycon dress or a tailored jumpsuit really helps define your best features.’ Not only that, Mollie revealed her tips to perfecting autumn style, ‘I think floral is really in this season, you can’t go wrong with a statement floral top or jumper to pull an outfit together.’ Sound good? If you fancy recharging your wardrobe and recreating Mollie’s look, head to Littlewoods now and shop the lot. Yep, really... Oh Zara, is there ever a time you won’t fill our lives with continuing joy? Answer: unlikely. The high street heroes have bought us yet another collection that’s subsequently made us want to empty our entire bank accounts. However, with the ‘Special Prices’ collection you can save on the big bucks- Zara may keep this one on the DL, but we’re about to tell all…    Shirt, £19.99, Zara It’s a section of the website that’ll not only create instant add-to-basket urges with everything being under £50, you can also shop IRL (just look out for the special tags) in store, too. Best part?

We're ready to update our 'drobes with some serious bargains from the high-street retailer The M&S Black Friday sale? We’re all over it. In fact, the high-street retailer’s discounts are one of the main reasons we’re excited for this year’s event. Because trust us, they’re going to be huge.   Whether you’re looking for winter coats, little black dresses or a new pair of high heels for party season, M&S has it all. Want to know more about Black Friday? Here are the deets…   What is Black Friday?   In short, it’s the biggest shopping weekend of the year. If you’re after Black Friday clothing deals or are looking to pick up one of the most fabulous Black Friday dresses out there, you’ll definitely find an eye-popping deal or two. When is Black Friday? It’s taking place on 24 November, so make sure you’ve got your alarm set nice and early. What’s in the M&S Black Friday sale? We don’t know for sure – they’re keeping everything firmly under wraps. But in 2016, there was up to half price off home, clothing and beauty items. In previous years, they’ve also had deals on sofas, bedding and towels.   Black Friday M&S clothes We don’t know if we’ll end up with a blazer or a pencil skirt, but we do know we can rely on the M&S Black Friday sale to give our A/W ‘drobe a chic update. We’re definitely interested to see if their (already very purse-friendly) £25 jeans will be slashed even further. It was hard not to pick up a pair in every shade earlier this year – they have options Light Grey, Indigo and Bleached – and now might be the time to do so. Black Friday M&S accessories From lingerie to jewellery, we’re keeping our eyes peeled for a few cute ‘bargs.   Black Friday M&S home As we’ve previously mentioned, there was up to half price off M&S home last year. Perhaps you recently bought your first pad, or just fancy jazzing up your uni halls. Whatever the case, we reckon you’ll find a cool armchair or Art Deco-style lamp at a great price. From under £20 There was Balmain. Then there was Kenzo. And now, none other than Turkish designer Erdem Moralioglu has joined forces with H&M.   If you haven’t heard of Erdem, 1) where have you been? and 2) let us bring you up to speed. It’s the label behind Alexa Chung, Kate Bosworth and Keira Knightley’s party dress collections, which we all know is a good thing. The DNA is demure, elegant and all we aspire to be every day, so when we heard the designer was teaming up with a brand that’s equally covetable but feasibly affordable, we couldn’t contain ourselves. Cue H&M. SEE: Erdem Is H&M’s Next Collaboration Designer The brand’s designer collabs hit peak need when it teamed up with Balmain in 2015. A year later came the Kenzo offering, which was equally standout. Different they were, but both collections had the desired effect: to provide VIP style at an affordable price. So only good things could be expected of Erdem x H&M, right? Ahead of the line landing on November 2nd then, we called upon Look influencers and team members to try the pieces before, and now we’re giving you a sneak preview of every single piece. Prepare for some serious shopping urges. Think the end of season sales are all but over? Think again. There’s actually a number of uh-mazing high street stores still offering knock-down prices and one of the best around is undoubtedly Warehouse. Why? There’s up to 70% off, plus, unlike a few other sales around this time of year, this one actually has a few new-season, trend-led buys thrown into the mix that are perfect for recharging your current wares, without blowing that all-important winter wardrobe budget.   There’s so many must-have pieces still in the sale that narrowing it down is probably the trickiest part. But fear not, as we’ve done all the hard work for you and handpicked the coolest styles with the biggest discounts to help you on your way. SEE: The Best Things To Buy In The River Island Sale We’re pinning anything of the asymmetric variety to be a winning piece for your AW17 wardrobe. Luckily, there’s plenty of choice here. The red silky midi dress comes with a waist-cinching belt and a subtle asymmetric hemline. Style with white trainers during the day, and layer over heeled knee high boots and top with chunky gold hoops for a night out.   For a statement separate, it’s all about vinyl style skirts. Be sure to get in on the trend and slip into the khaki mini iteration that’s now a purse-pleasing £10 (yes, really) and team with everything in your current wardrobe. Maximalists should look to the printed top, complete with tie waist detail and layer under a blazer during the day, and style with a leather trouser, heels and a bold red lip for the evening. Still not convinced to shop this mega sale? You’ll also find striped midi skirts, minimalist jumpsuits, classic trench coats and plenty of floral pieces in there, too. Scroll below to see our favourite sale buys or head to Warehouse to shop the lot. It's gone down A LOT... Let’s admit it. Engaged or not, we’ve all thought about our perfect wedding dress at some point. But after spending hours binge-watching Say Yes To The Dress and chatting to married pals, it’s easy to feel a little overwhelmed about how much they cost.   We guess diamond-encrusted corsets and Cinderella-inspired trains can really add up… Us, divas? We don’t know what you’re talking about. See: High Street Wedding Dresses: The LOOK Edit    But whether you’re planning your day for reals or just in your head (because that’s totally normal, ‘kay?), there may be no need to worry about not being able to afford your dream gown. Because according to a survey, wedding dresses aren’t as expensive as they used to be. Yep. Research by online shopping destination Lyst has found that women are spending an average of £832 on their frocks, which is down 20% from £1112 last year. It’s also a potential saving of £280. Which, in our opinion, means £280 more for champagne. Photo: Getty, Kirsty Wigglesworth – WPA Pool See: This Couple Are Charging Guests To Attend Their Wedding Lyst’s results were based on search, sales and active browsing figures across its website and 12,000 partner brands, as well as a survey of 100 brides-to-be. Okay, so £832 is still pretty spenny. But if you’re looking for something even cheaper, there are now plenty of options available to you. A number of high street retailers have launched bridal ranges, including Coast, ASOS, Topshop and Dorothy Perkins.  Interestingly, Lyst found that while users are still searching for designer labels, the demand for brands such as Self Portrait, Needle And Thread and Whistles (where a dress is usually priced in the mid-hundreds) is rising. When you put it into perspective, you do only wear your gown once. And with so many more affordable designs on the market, it’s no wonder brides are choosing to splash out elsewhere. Would you wear high street on your wedding day? Let us know over on Twitter @lookmagazine. OMG OMG OMG Londoners listen up – this is the news we’ve all been waiting for. Just when we all thought ASOS couldn’t actually get any better, the online high street retailer has just announced it’s rolling out a same day delivery service, from right now. That’s right. Offering the savvy shopping service to 122 London-based postcodes, this game-changing option is part of the new ‘ASOS Instant’ initiative. Essentially, it means you’ll worry no more about last minute outfits arriving on time when you’re on a bit of a deadline. The only downside? So far the option is only available to Londoners, with major cities nationwide expected to get in on the action in the coming few months.   SEE: What To Buy From ASOS Right Now So how much does it cost? To enjoy this uh-mazing new same day service will set you back a fairly reasonable £12.95, which we see as a far nicer option than heading into town on the hunt for said last minute outfit. Forget busy tubes, elbowing your way through the many other shoppers to get to that dream purchase only to find they don’t even have it in your size. Sound familiar? We’ve all been there. Instead, simply log onto good ol’ ASOS and take all the stress out of last minute shopping. To ensure you don’t miss out, you will need to get that all-important order placed before 10am the same day you’re hoping to receive the items.  Then, expect your knight in shining ASOS van to appear anywhere between 6-10pm.   It’s quite literally the best thing ever. And it couldn’t come a minute sooner, as those clever folk have taken into account the impending festive season and the many (many) potential outfit dilemmas ahead. Bravo, ASOS. We're obsessed... There may be a new drop of achingly cool pieces flying onto the virtual rails of Zara on a near daily basis, and believe us when we say we never fail to get excited. But this latest lot, the Zara Studio collection to be specific, has totally floored us. It landed just this week, and although the pieces aren’t available to actually order today, you can however, request a notification for the styles you’ve got your eye on right now – and we’re betting you’ll want the lot – to avoid disappointment.   So, what’s all the fuss about? Let’s start with the amazing outerwear. Expect to find your new winter camel coat-of-dreams, a leather trench coat and a number of chic black jackets guaranteed to elevate your workwear wardrobe in a flash. SEE: What To Buy From Zara Right Now Boots, £129, Zara Studio   On the accessory front, there’s a lace-up biker boot that ticks all the right boxes and taps into the chunky boot trend that’s the street style look du jour right now. If it’s little black dresses you’re after, you won’t be disappointed. Long, backless styles in silky satin fabrics that’s ideal for day-to-night dressing when worn over knee high leather boots during the day, and bare legs and heels in the evening, to mini shirt-style iterations – we dare you not to fall in love with one of these winning LBD’s. Dress, £89.99, Zara Studio Finally, we can’t leave out what we’re predicting to be the smash hit from the new Studio collection, the checked skirt suit. The double breasted tailored jacket has a chic, waist-cinching belt on the back, which can be styled oh so cooly solo with denim and a sock-style ankle boot. Or, to tap into the suiting trend, why not go for maximum impact and wear yours with the matching high-waist pleated skirt. There’s quite literally nothing here we don’t love. Happy shopping!

Go, go, go!   Words, Charlotte Cronin Let your tee do the talking this Breast Cancer Awareness Month Breast cancer is the most common cancer in the UK with one person diagnosed every ten minutes. In the time it takes you to eat your overnight oats or boil the kettle and drink your cup of tea someone’s life changes forever. With one in eight women diagnosed with breast cancer each year it’s a disease that will have undoubtedly had some contact with your nearest and dearest. Whether it’s tangled into your family tree or something that’s affected your best friend, or a friend-of-a-friend there’s a network of women (and men) fighting it each and everyday.   One of the gals fighting is blogger, Lauren Mahon of ‘Girl Stole London’ who was diagnosed last year and has since harnessed her influence and social presence to spread awareness of the disease and raise money to support the charities, which have been a rock for her from her diagnosis to today. Sharing honest anecdotes and experiences of everything from ‘cold caps’ to ‘Pete’ her PICC Line (the tube that’s attached to your arm for Chemotherapy, just above your elbow, until your treatment is over). Photos, Alex Cameron   Lauren’s site candidly documents her experience of cancer and provided her with the inspo to start #GIRLvsCANCER establishing a community of support across social channels. Teaming up with  Look Influencer’s to launch her first collection of tongue-in-cheek slogan tees in February proudly emblazoned with cheeky phrases like ‘lady lumps’ and ‘mammaries.’ Lauren’s just released her second collection of aptly coined ‘tit-tees’ in collaboration with Dom&Ink ready for #BreastCancerAwarenessMonth with fried eggs, milk jugs and wasp detailing across the chest. Shot by Alex Cameron the bloggers + boobs campaign features thirty-three of your favourite online gals and gives us all not only a great opportunity to support both Lauren and four incredible charities but also provides us with a reminder to check our own boobs  (CoppaFeel’s super easy step-by-step illustrations are a great help for working out what’s normal for you and what to do when something feels different). With your favourite bloggers and influencers, like Gemma Styles, Liv Purvis and Danielle Peazer already proudly wearing theirs – pick one up to support Lauren, the two women who’ve been diagnosed with breast cancer since you clicked on this site and the hundreds of thousands of women fighting around the UK. Lauren aims to raise awareness of young women knowing their breasts to ensure that any changes are detected early so lives can be saved. The tit-tee is just £28 with 25% of profits  from the GIRLvsCANCER tee being donated equally between the charities CoppaFeel, Future Dreams, Trekstock and Look Good Feel Better.

 We all love a designer doppelganger and Primark always comes up trumps when it comes to new trends and could-be-catwalk pieces. Take this dotty dress from their new winter’17 range for example. Thanks to its black mesh tulle fabric and silver spotty print this frock is a dead ringer for that seen on the Dior AW’17 catwalk.  The only difference? The £11k price tag of course.    If like us, your bank balance is a little more all-cashed-out rather than splash-all-out then Primark’s version is a lot more purse-friendly. At just £13 you could afford to buy this dress 846 times over for the cost of Dior’s mesh maxi alone! *gasp!* Now we know what you’re thinking, designer-double or not why would I need a mesh see-through dress in the middle of autumn? But don’t fret; this fancy frock is a lot more versatile than you think! Layer it over roll-necks and a pair of jeans to amp up your usual dressed-down weekend look. Still not convinced? Why not take a tip from Dior fan girl, Bella Hadid, and wear yours over a pair of high-waisted hotpants and a branded bralet for a Christmas party get-up that’s guaranteed to turn heads. Picture: REX   Now before you hit the highstreet in a fashionable frenzy we have to warn you… this designer double dress doesn’t hit Primark stores until a couple of weeks yet, giving you plenty of time to find the perfect Primark party shoes to pair it with! We say yes… The latest item causing a stir on our Insta feed? You’ve got Kylie Jenner to thank for this one. It’s essentially a crop top with a twist. Yes, the style savvy 20-year-old shared an Insta post to her impressive 98.5 million followers of her latest wardrobe hero piece and it’s quite literally got us all talking. The best way to describe Kylie’s new staple is a cropped, crop top. Kylie slipped into a micro version of the already revealing separate, and much like any other daring Insta trend picked up by one of the Jenner sisters, ASOS has whipped up a striking alternative so we can all get in on the action. Said item is a cheery £20, comes in a black, fine knit finish with super-long sleeves and it’s the perfect piece for adding an unexpected edge to your incoming autumnal wardrobe.   Jumper, £20, ASOS It’s fair to say this one is not for the faint hearted.  There’s really only one way to wear it, and that’s over a tee or body. Jeans, wide-leg trousers, vinyl skirts – you can pretty much style it up with whatever you like on the bottom half, once you’ve got the top part right. SEE: What To Buy From ASOS Right Now   Kylie wore her standout piece over a basic nude jersey body, to preserve her modesty and finished the statement look with a high rise, distressed jean and pair of equally chic perspex sunnies. So far, so Kylie. Should you brave the divisive trend – and we really think you should – we’d suggest mirroring Kylie’s casual layered look and slinging yours on over a basic tee, Breton or fine roll neck knit to let your super-cropped, crop top take centre stage. Or why not throw yours over a silky slip dress for a night out? Just add sky-high sock boots, super-sized earrings and a box clutch to finish. The styling options are endless. Bravo, Kylie for introducing us to yet another winning trend. Seriously... If you’re anything like us, you won’t need much persuasion to visit Zara.com and also won’t need a lot of help filling up your baskets in approximately 3.5 seconds. However, although you may know what you want and be able to enter you credit cards quicker than you can check the limit, there’s always the not knowing if whatever you buy will actually fit or not. And of course you’ll want to wear it as soon as you rip open the delivery bag, so Zara has created a solution to this problem and given us another excuse to online shop, immediately…    So, first of all if you scroll down to the bottom of the product you NEED, okay WANT and select the ‘Find my size’ option. This is where you can now enter your height, weight and your preferred fit i.e tight, perfect, or loose and it will calculate a suggested size you should buy, yep really.   But wait, there’s more… See: The Best Zara Coats You’ll Want Now  It will suggest the percentage of people that opted for the two likely sizes based on the data you entered, and if you want an even more specific way of finding ‘the one’ then you can select the ‘Add information’ option to add in even more details.  This is where you’ll come to three additional questions, they are all optional but the more you answer the more likely you are to be able to wear your Zara purchase as soon as it lands on your doorstep. AMAZING. So, the first option is to select your figure type from the below choices of flatter, average, curvier. Once you’ve done this you can then move on to step 2… See: The Zara Jacket Everyone Wants Is Back  This is where you select your body shape, from straighter, average and wider and move on to the final step towards your perfect outfit…  This is where you have the option of choosing your age to add to the questionnaire in search of the best fit. Remember, all steps are optional and you can choose to ‘Skip’ any sections you don’t wish to answer.  Once all these are added it’s nearly time to buy your new Zara picks, eeek. The best part if you ask us! So, now this is where Zara tells you which percentage of a certain size was purchased and not returned based on the information you have entered. Clever, eh?  This breakthrough will literally change the way you shop, FOREVER, and subsequently mean you won’t have to deal with any more annoying returns or have to worry about trying before you buy. And yes, in case you were wondering, we will be buying the checked blazer because it’s the cover-up of the season and if you haven’t got one already it’s time to invest. Happy shopping!
