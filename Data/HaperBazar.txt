 Looking for more sustainable shopping habits? These are the sites to know, shop, and sell on.  In our quest to become more sustainable, we‚Äôre constantly looking for new ways to develop smarter, more eco-conscious shopping habits. Despite there being a growing number of eco-friendly fashion  brands to shop, there‚Äôs nothing more sustainable than buying vintage. Whether you‚Äôre looking for some unique fashion finds or trying to earn some extra money by cleaning out your closet, there are plenty of online consignment sites to both buy and sell on (please don‚Äôt just throw out your clothes when you‚Äôre done with them!).  Aside from being good for the environment, these luxury consignment sites are also the best ways to score those one-of-a-kind designer pieces that everybody else on Instagram won‚Äôt already have. Shop (and sell) all the best below.  If you‚Äôre looking to sell items from your own closet, The Real Real makes life easier by offering free in-home pickups so you don‚Äôt have to mail your items in to sell. Alternatively, you can ship your items directly to them for free or visit a Luxury Consignment Office for a valuation and drop-off. Then, the site does all the work for you: authenticating, photographing, pricing, and listing your items to sell online. Sellers earn up to 85% commission for the selling price of your items (one of the highest rates in comparison to other sites). If you‚Äôre looking to buy, The Real Real boasts an insanely large selection of designer items from vintage bags to shoes, apparel, accessories, and even furniture that any fashion lover could have fun perusing through.

 The 21-year-old face of Dior opens up in a candid interview with her fellow-supermodel sister.  GIGI HADID:  Fans assume they know you because you‚Äôre in the public eye. But what is one thing people would be surprised to learn about you?  BELLA HADID:  That I never go a day without smiling. People always say I have the same facial expressions. But what they don‚Äôt realize is that for a long time I looked that way because photographers on set would direct me to look ‚Äúbored‚Äù or ‚Äúvery nonchalant.‚Äù But it isn‚Äôt necessarily the way I really am. You‚Äôve known me, of course, my whole life. And ever since I was a baby, I was always smiling. GH: It‚Äôs funny how people think you‚Äôre not a smiler; I‚Äôve seen the comments. But I don‚Äôt see you that way at all. I have my own vision of you as someone who is kind, friendly, and very gentle. Does the negativity on social media ever get to you? BH:  For a while I fought a lot of battles‚Äîwith myself, with people online‚Äîand it brought me down. When people would say, ‚ÄúOh, she‚Äôs so mean,‚Äù I wanted to say, ‚ÄúMaybe I‚Äôve just had a bad day! Or maybe I‚Äôve just been crying.‚Äù You never know what people are going through. "For a while I fought a lot of battles‚Äîwith myself, with people online‚Äîand it brought me down."   GH:  People see a photo on Instagram and assume you are this one-sided person.   BH:  They see such a small piece of our lives, like paparazzi photos of us leaving the house. You know how awkward that is? To walk out of your own home and have 40 people waiting outside. And then you need to smile at random strangers.   GH:  And if you don‚Äôt, they‚Äôre like, ‚ÄúOh, she looks like a bitch today.‚Äù In fact, though, you have more patience and compassion than anyone I know. I always see you stop for fans. And after a long day of work, you always remember everyone‚Äôs name, and you always give people hugs. BH: That goes back to how we were raised. As you know, our mom always taught us that you should treat everyone the same, whether it‚Äôs the president or the person working under you. Everyone‚Äôs time is important. That‚Äôs why I always stop for fans. They could be at home with their families, but they‚Äôre not: They‚Äôre standing outside our hotel in the cold just to give us a hug. That means something! GH: Another thing people don‚Äôt realize about you is that you‚Äôre a homebody. "Sometimes I just want to be me for 30 minutes, not 'Bella.'"   BH:  Totally! People think I‚Äôm such a party girl, but that‚Äôs a thing of the past. I can‚Äôt wait to just sit on the couch this weekend! Now that our careers have gotten to the heights that they have and our job is to be around people all day and go to parties, the last thing I want to do on a Saturday night is go out. I just want to be around people who love me. Like you and I play video games, watch movies, paint pottery‚Äîall the stupid shit we used to do back in our childhood before we became Gigi and Bella.     GH: What else do you do to stay centered? BH:  Before bed I love listening to meditation music. It helps me zone out and fall asleep. And in the morning I make it a point to keep my phone away from me for 30 minutes so my brain can start functioning before I get completely overwhelmed by the media. Sometimes I just want to be me for 30 minutes, not ‚ÄúBella.‚Äù Lead image: Dior Haute Couture dress and mask; Dior Fine Jewelry ring; Hair: Sam McKnight for Hair by Sam McKnight; Makeup: Peter Philips for Dior; Manicure: Chisato Yamamoto; Production: Sally Dawson and Paula Ekenger; Set Design: Andrew Tomlinson; Retouching: Digital Light Ltd.; Photo Assistants: Simon McGuigan, Jamie Rowan, and Kai Cem Narin; Digital Operator: Lucie Byatt.

 The pop princess shows off MCM styles the Billie Eilish way. If you haven't noticed, Billie Eilish is having a great July and we're only halfway through the month. After teaming up with her idol Justin Bieber for the "Bad Guy (Remix)," the pop princess is now the face of MCM's fall/winter 2019 campaign, the first campaign from Dirk Sch√∂nberger, MCM's new global creative director.  "For me she‚Äôs a bit of a role model for younger generations, even though she would probably hate the word,‚Äù Sch√∂nberger told WWD. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen her play concerts and she tells her fans to be themselves without holding back.‚Äù Photographed by Lea Colombo, Eilish stays true to her signature style by layering an oversized cream and red MCM tracksuit over a white shirt with the MCM logo written around the neck, and MCM's classic brown monogram bucket hat and fanny pack draped over one shoulder.  Elsewhere in the campaign, Eilish wears an oversized black sweatsuit with red strap on the wrist of the hoodie and on ankle of the pants, paired with a bubblegum pink MCM beanie hat.  "I like to glorify the things that make people uncomfortable," Eilish says in the promo clip posted to MCM's official socials. It's Billie's approach to everything‚Äîfashion, music, etc.‚Äîthat has made her the voice of Gen Z and a perfect match for MCM's aesthetic.    ‚ÄúThis is such a strong message at a time where uniformity is somehow on the rise,‚Äù Sch√∂nberger added. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a game-changer: Not only is she disruptive, but it also feels like she can‚Äôt be corrupted. It‚Äôs not a marketing trick: She is that person. She really stands out in the current music scene.‚Äù  COMING SOON #MCMAW19 A post shared by  MCM (@mcmworldwide) on Jul 17, 2019 at 4:21am PDT

 Cute dresses, tops, and skirts await.  Reformation's style categories have expanded over the past years, going from a sustainable clothing brand that offers just cute dresses and tops to one that also offers jeans, swimsuits, petite-size clothing, and children's clothes. Last year in March, the company even, finally, released a plus size collection with model Ali Tate Cutler in sizes 0 to 22 and XS to 3X. However, the dresses, tops, and two-piece sets were only part of a capsule collection and once sold out, disappeared from the website.  For those who were utterly bummed by this, not to worry, Reformation came back with even better news. Today, the beloved brand announced a permanent size-inclusive collection (!!!). What you can expect from this line: 18 of Reformation‚Äôs best-selling styles, including tops, bodysuits, skirts, and dresses (with new things added monthly) starting at $48. The size range is 1X to 3X and 14 to 24. The pieces are currently available to shop on Reformation and will also be on Nordstrom March 29.  Since Ref's extended sizing collection isn't going anywhere, take comfort in the fact you'll have access to crisp white dresses and daisy printed skirts until the end of summer. Below, our favorite pieces to wear for tropical vacations, brunches, and beyond.

 Are your socks even designer?  If you've ever scoffed at the idea of getting socks for Christmas, allow Rihanna to introduce you to the Gucci pair you never knew you needed.    Putting all of our sad, mismatched socks to shame, Bad Gal Riri showed off her new white crystal Gucci socks, which retail for a casual $1,340, on Instagram. The Gucci logo socks first made their debut at the fashion house's Resort 2018 show in Milan. And thanks to the incredible superpowers of Rihanna, now even the most frugal of shoppers could probably justify shelling out a thousand dollars for a single pair of socks.  I mean, do you SEE these socks? Iconic . Completing the look, the singer wore a black tank dress with a red, white, and blue puffer jacket. Rihanna let the crystal Gucci socks shine by styling them with a pair of white heeled mules. Of course, this isn't the first time the singer has made a pair of socks cool. Previously, she collaborated with Stance on a sock collection inspired by her iconic red carpet style as well as a holiday collection featuring socks that read "Thottie or Nice?" (another wishlist must-have for us all). If anyone could single-handedly make socks exciting, it's Bad Gal Riri herself. And while she may already have her hands full with her Fenty Beauty collection and the Fenty Puma x Rihanna line, a Fenty sock collection may be something to consider for the future.  Now please excuse me while I go update my Christmas list to include yet another pair of Rihanna-approved socks.
 How to Not Look Basic at a Music Festival 101.  Festival season is in full swing‚Äîbut for the first time, festival street style is diminishing in interest.

 The duo is joining forces again for the fourth consecutive season.  Gigi Hadid and Tommy Hilfiger have taken their ongoing design collaboration to New York, Los Angeles, and London so far. Next stop on the duo's globe-trotting runway show? Milan. The designer that announced his fourth consecutive collection with the supermodel will hit the runway at Milan Fashion Week on February 25th. The Spring 2018 see-now, buy-now collection will follow the duo's most recent TommyNow show, which debuted at London Fashion Week back in September. Like last season's presentation, the Milan show will include both menswear and womenswear, which will be available to shop straight from the runway.  ‚ÄúMy vision for TOMMYNOW was to create a global platform that we could take on tour to bring our show experience to new audiences around the world," Hilfiger said in a statement from the brand. "It‚Äôs about the fusion of fashion, entertainment and pop culture with experiences, performances and inspiring interactions that are designed around our consumers. As one of the fashion capitals of the world, Milan is the perfect place to celebrate our next TOMMYNOW show.‚Äù A theme for next season's collection has yet to be announced, but past collaborations have been over-the-top productions including the "Rock Circus" show in London, "TommyLand" in Los Angeles, and "Tommy Pier" in New York. No matter what the vibe for Spring 2018 is, you can expect another TommyxGigi extravaganza sure to take over your social media feeds.  What started out as a temporary design collaboration between Hadid and Hilfiger has flourished into an ongoing project that's already spanned four back-to-back seasons due to its commercial success. It's unclear whether the Spring 2018 show in Milan will be the final collaborative show between the designer and the model.
 Serena Williams, LeBron James, Odell Beckham Jr., and others also star in the campaign. Two summers ago, former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick took a knee during the singing of The National Anthem in protest against racism and oppression plaguing the black community in the United States. "I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color," Kaepernick told NFL Media. Since then, the athlete has been both lauded and criticized for his powerful statement‚Äîand without a job in the league for over a year.  While many companies would run from a polarizing figure like Kaepernick, Nike's doubled down on its relationship offering the activist a new, multiyear deal and making him the face of the brand's "Just Do It" 30th-anniversary campaign.   Believe in something, even if it means sacrificing everything. #JustDoIt A post shared by  colin kaepernick (@kaepernick7) on Sep 3, 2018 at 12:20pm PDT "Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything," reads the text over a black-and-white portrait of Kaepernick. According to the New York Times, Nike will design Kaepernick merchandise, including a sneaker and t-shirt as part of the deal. Nike will also donate money to Kaepernick's Know Your Rights camp, which he launched in 2017 to "raise awareness on higher education, self empowerment, and instruction to properly interact with law enforcement in various scenarios." The "Just Do It" anniversary campaign also stars other athletes like Serena Williams, LeBron James, Odell Beckham Jr., Lacey Baker, and Shaquem Griffin. You can take the superhero out of her costume, but you can never take away her superpowers. #justdoit pic.twitter.com/dDB6D9nzaD As expected  Kaepernick's new endorsement deal isn't sitting too well with some people. Miffed former-costumers haven taken to burning merchandise (they presumably paid for with their own money) in "protest."  "Our Soundman just cut the Nike swoosh off his socks. Former marine. Get ready @Nike multiply that by the millions," one man tweeted.  Our Soundman just cut the Nike swoosh off his socks. Former marine. Get ready @Nike multiply that by the millions. pic.twitter.com/h8kj6RXe7j Another took a video of himself burning his Nike sneakers and posed the question: "Since when did the American Flag and the National Anthem become offensive?" Others followed suit, which launched the hashtag #burnyournikes. First the @NFL forces me to choose between my favorite sport and my country. I chose country. Then @Nike forces me to choose between my favorite shoes and my country. Since when did the American Flag and the National Anthem become offensive? pic.twitter.com/4CVQdTHUH4 The NFL has yet to issue a statement in reaction to the news nor has President Trump who has been quite vocal on Kaepernick in the past.

 The brand's collections will be created by its in-house design team until a successor is announced.  Oliver Lapidus is leaving Lanvin after less than a year in the role. The label's in-house team will be responsible for forthcoming collections until a successor is named. In an official statement, the designer was thanked for having "steered the Maison through a transitional period between ownerships." Lapidus will return to work on his own label, Creation Olivier Lapidus. He joined the luxury label‚Äîknown as oldest surviving couture house‚Äîin July last year and has created two collections, neither of which have been received positively.  His latest show, which was presented in Paris last month, was branded "abysmal" by veteran fashion critic Cathy Horyn, while the Guardian said that his eveningwear "failed to capture the insouciant magic" of former Lanvin creative director Alber Elbaz. Having worked at Balmain Homme, as well as his own label, Lapidus had big plans for the business aiming to rebrand it as a "French Michael Kors." However, not long after the designer's first collection was panned, Lanvin was acquired by Fosun, the Chinese conglomerate that also owns Club Med. The conglomerate reportedly invested ‚Ç¨100 million ($123 million) to help restore the label's fortunes which have been suffering since before Elbaz was ousted in 2015. Elbaz‚Äîa much-loved industry figure who helmed Lanvin for 14 years‚Äîwas known for his feminine, glamorous eveningwear that was hit on the red carpet and among fashion circles. Regardless, sales dropped (some say because its accessories weren't strong enough), and Elbaz was fired. He was replaced by Bouchra Jarrar, who tried a more fuss-free, androgynous look which failed to resonate with Lanvin customers. She left after 16 months at the helm and Lapidus was hired four days later.

 The legendary designer has been a long-time collaborator with Cher. Throughout her career, Cher's iconic sense of style has been shaped by her many Bob Mackie-designed looks.  From sparkling sheer dresses to a feathered Met Gala look to that famous 1986 Oscars headdress, Mackie and Cher have collaborated on a number of legendary ensembles over the decades. So it's only fitting that the designer has signed on to create costumes for the upcoming Broadway musical, The Cher Show.   In a first look at the upcoming show's costumes, three of Mackie's sketches have been released. Each of the designs represents a different era of Cher's life‚Äîfrom a 1960s-inspired Cher sporting striped flare pants, a fur vest and bangs to a bedazzled two-piece set resembling Cher's 1988 Oscars look.    Set to debut on Broadway this fall, the musical is based on the life of Cherilyn Sarkisian LaPiere Bono Allman (also simply known as Cher)‚Äîfrom her childhood in Los Angeles to her glamorous days on television to selling millions of records and becoming an Oscar-winning actress. Its name pays nod to the icon's former CBS variety show, The Cher Show, which followed her series with Sonny Bono in the 1970s.  The Broadway adaptation has already gained the seal of approval from Cher herself‚Äîwho broke the news last year on Twitter, writing: "I sobbed and laughed, and I was prepared not to like it. Audience clapped after songs, and gave it standing ovation." Just walked Of the musical‚ú®üíñ‚ú®I SOBBED & LAUGHED,& I WAS PREPARED NOT 2LIKE IT. AUDIENCE CLAPPED AFTER SONGS,& GAVE IT STANDING OVATIONüéÇ And now, complete with a Bob Mackie-designed wardrobe, The Cher Show just reached a new level of legendary.    The Cher Show will have a pre-Broadway premiere at Chicago‚Äôs Oriental Theatre from June 12 - July 15, 2018 before hitting Broadway this fall.

 Every runway show needs Leslie Jones in the front row.  For members of the fashion set, attending runway show after runway show during Fashion Week can sometimes become a little tiresome, mundane, and stuffy. But today, Leslie Jones dished out a master lesson in how to have the greatest time ever at New York Fashion Week.  While attendees at fashion shows are traditionally silent (aside from a light applause after the finale), Jones lightened up the mood and had some fun in the front row at Christian Siriano's Spring 2018 show today. The SNL writer cheered, hollered, and clapped throughout the entire runway show, shouting "You work, girl!!!" and "YASSS" at the models. And it was glorious.  This sums up our #spring2018 show! @cocorocha and @Lesdoggg being so fabulous. Sound up!!!

 Your guide to being the best-dressed guest of the season. The warm weather, the flowers in bloom‚Äîit's no wonder so many brides decide to get married in the spring. As you enter the coming season, weekends booked up with wedding after wedding, the need for a chic springtime ensemble (or twelve) is paramount. Whether it's an elegant garden party, a destination event or a black-tie affair, here's all the outfit inspiration you'll need for every ceremony and reception on your calendar. When shopping, keep your various weddings in mind to maximize the looks you'll get out of each piece‚Äìand splurge on things like shoes, which will transition easily to next season's equally jam-packed wedding circuit. Here, our favorite ensembles to land you the title of best dressed guest at spring's wedding fetes. To subscribe to BAZAAR Bride's ultimate guide to weddings, click here. Spring is here and buds are in bloom‚Äìand we suggest you take the themes of the season literally when dressing for warm weather weddings. You cannot go wrong with pastels at celebrations that will most likely take place outdoors, and softer hues feel right for parties that are pre-summer. Come July, you'll likely want to sport brights. Embrace changing seasons with a feminine power suit by accessorizing the look with bold colors; then, add some edge to avoid looking too girly.

Channel the '70s or a more free spirited vibe if petite bloom prints and overly feminine florals aren't your thing. Draw out the bolder tones of your print with accessories to avoid sticking to pastel hues that, to you, may seem too saccharine. If you're aiming for a look with this strong a point of view, don't stray from your theme when it comes to the extras‚Äìabstract prints, feathers, and tassels all drive home a playful vibe that's more sultry than sweet.

Dazzle on the dance floor in flirty silhouettes that feel celebratory year round‚Äìnot just on New Year's Eve. To avoid the look going too Gatsby, stick to a monochromatic palette, and anchor a midi with a sexy sandal, rather than a '20s style dance shoe.

Pair graphic prints with romantic and luxe extras; they soften the feeling of a repeat dot, stripe or floral. For an upscale take, complement the classic color pairing with a jewel tone; a rich emerald feels more on point for spring than a deep oxblood, sapphire or amethyst.

There is no way to go wrong with a LBD‚Äìespecially when you give it a new look with unexpected, yet playful, extras. For a bit of fun, keep your shoes, bag and jewels thematic without being too matchy-matchy (stay away from jewelry sets and shoes and bags from the same collection). Adding a bit of color and sparkle will take a little black dress from siren to celebratory.

Choose vibrant jewel tones and pops of color for daytime dressing in spring for a look that's bound to stand out from the pack. Rather than jump into summer too quickly, mix in the rich fabrications most associated with the cooler months‚Äìlike velvet and exotic skins‚Äìto take a day dress from too-casual to warm weather cocktails.

 The Lizzie Fortunato brand manager takes BAZAAR inside her closet to demonstrate how she brings Texas fashion to Brooklyn.   ‚ÄãJuliana Ramirez. ‚ÄãI‚Äôm the brand manager at Lizzie Fortunato, a soon-to-be cowboy boot maker, and a photographer.     I live near Prospect Park in Brooklyn. I grew up in Texas.  Absolutely! I actually thought it didn‚Äôt because I was so against anything honky-tonk growing up. I‚Äôm definitely more into Western wear and have such an appreciation for seeing Western silhouettes on the runway. I feel like I have a really terrible, I don't know if this is the right word, ownership... I feel like it almost belongs to me being from Texas, and that's totally not fair! And of course, my love of cowboy boots comes from being a Texan.  I always liked cowboy boots, but it was more in the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to the rodeo.‚Äù Rodeo is a really big deal. In Texas, if you were ‚Äústylish,‚Äù in my hometown at least, you would never wear cowboy boots casually in the way I do now. It has a totally different meaning in Texas, which is so silly.     Ever-changing! I truly don‚Äôt think I could put my ‚Äústyle‚Äù in a box and present it to you with a silk ribbon on top. I thrive off of change and my style is a direct reflection of that.   I always wear my grandmother's necklace and her ring. I feel like I carry her with me. She always had a witchy vibe, I feel like I‚Äôm holding some of her powers, if you will. She was very much a Puerto Rican grandma‚Äîinto all the superstition stuff. I feel like I carry a part of her with me and she protects me through her powers. It sounds so silly but that‚Äôs totally how I feel about it.  This [dress] is something my grandmother made for my aunt. It‚Äôs a cloak/shawl thing. I wore it as a dress for my 25th birthday. It was disco-themed. I wore high waisted black underwear and a cute bra, and this pair of Celine heels that I have that are destroyed. I really love this thing. I was in Puerto Rico with my grandmother, my aunt, and my mom, going through all of these old clothes and I really wanted this, but my aunt didn‚Äôt want to part with it. Two weeks later it showed up in the mail! About a month before my birthday, when I first saw it back in Puerto Rico, I said ‚ÄúThat's what I‚Äôm wearing!‚Äù    This Celine sport dress was probably the best score I've ever found. I think I got it for around $50, if not less. I was like, 'I just robbed you guys, are you kidding?!' It‚Äôs the hardest thing to wear. The fabric is heavy. There are probably three days out of the year that I can wear this properly.    Sweaters! I buy way too many sweaters! I‚Äôm never satisfied with my sweaters for some reason. I think I have a hard time finding them.    
  Yes, I have this grey sweater that I absolutely love because it's never pilled! I‚Äôve had it for over a year. But yeah, I have way too many sweaters, which isn‚Äôt a bad thing here.    Something that I haven‚Äôt already seen on Instagram. I‚Äôm doing this crazy purge. My best friend and I had this conversation about influencers and personal style. I have this fear of losing my sense of style because I‚Äôm constantly being bombarded with images of people who wear certain things. Do I actually like this, or have I talked myself into liking something?  I have the hardest time trying to figure out if I like this thing I‚Äôm holding in the store because I‚Äôve seen it so many times, or if I actually just like the thing. It‚Äôs been very recent, within the past eight months, that I've been thinking about personal style and redefining what that means to me.       Receiving my first piece from Nikki was something I didn‚Äôt realize would end up meaning so much to me. Life has a funny way of working in circles and meeting/working with her was one of them. In Texas, I admired her from afar and funny enough (this is the life working in circles part), when I moved to the city, Nikki ended up being the first person to hire me to do anything. My gratitude towards our friendship grows in tandem with my love for her designs.  The '60s. They have the best tights. I‚Äôve been hardcore shopping online for vintage tights that have really cool patterns‚Äîwhich you‚Äôd think would be an easy thing to find but it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs easy to find costume tights that are cheesy, but real tights that are really well made and that have a really interesting pattern are so hard to find.     Uptown Girls, more specifically Molly Gunn. I remember that character having such an early, lasting effect on me. Molly‚Äôs approach to style was relentlessly frivolous. Individually, her looks had this ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not asking for your permission‚Äù attitude about them.     
 The athleisure pieces make their debut in motion.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. Earlier this year, Jonathan Simkhai and Carbon38 joined forces for an athleisure collection that was the ultimate mashup of runway meets yoga studio. Following the success of the inaugural collaboration, the brands are back with a second installment for Fall/Winter 2017. Featuring 22 pieces, the latest Jonathan Simkhai x Carbon38 collection combines the sporty-meets-sexy aesthetic of Simkhai's namesake brand with Carbon38's signature luxe take on activewear. The end result? A collection spanning beyond your standard sports bras and leggings, instead delving into plush cropped flares, belted t-shirts, and lace-up detailing. Most impressively, however, the collaboration managed to transform a corset into an activewear staple reimagined in the form of sports bras and tank tops.  "My goal is to empower women to lead their active lives in style with pieces that make them feel feminine and unstoppable. Partnering with Carbon38 was a natural step as they understood and embraced my aesthetic. I‚Äôm thrilled to have created a collection with them that marries sensual silhouettes with pragmatic fabrics," Simkhai said in a statement from the brand.   The full Jonathan Simkhai x Carbon38 collection is available to shop now at jonathansimkhai.com and carbon38.com. See and shop the full range of pieces below.

 In honor of a decade in the biz, shop a limited edition capsule collection entitled ‚ÄòThe One That Got Away.‚Äô Altuzarra is turning ten, and it‚Äôs a mark of a great designer that we still want to wear pieces from each of his collections.

The results are 12 ready-to-wear pieces and 3 accessories, available exclusively at Barney‚Äôs in New York and mytheresa.com and altuzarra.com from January 2019. If we‚Äôve learned anything from this, it‚Äôs to not let an Altuzarra piece you love go un-purchased‚Äîthese are some highly collectible pieces. See the capsule on the ladies who chose them below.

 The Crawford jean is finally here.  If you've ever been on a quest for the perfect pair of '90s-style jeans, chances are you did a million Google searches for throwback Cindy Crawford photos to get inspired. From those classic Levi's to the denim cutoffs she wore in her 1992 Pepsi commercial, the supermodel became an instant denim icon during her breakout decade. And now, she's finally designing a pair of her own.  The supermodel joined forces with denim brand Re/Done for a capsule collection aptly called "The Crawford." The collection‚Äîa collaboration between both Re/Done and Levi's‚Äîincludes T-shirts, sweatshirts, and jeans (some of which are available exclusively through Re/Done's Instagram Stories for the next 24 hours).  Cindy announced the collaboration with a cheeky Instagram video:   Along with The Crawford jean (pictured above), the collection also includes a Cindy Crawford hoodie (available for $260):   A crewneck sweatshirt (available for $235): And short and long-sleeved vintages tees (which are available for $125 and $160 respectively).  A limited amount of pieces from the collection are available to shop now through the Instagram Stories of both @ShopRedone and @CindyCrawford. After today, The Crawford collection will be available to shop mid-September at Barneys New York, Colette, Ron Herman Japan and shopredone.com. 
 The athlete donned a statement-making Off-White look.  Last year, Serena Williams made her post-pregnancy return to tennis in a Nike catsuit that was controversially "banned" from the French Open. This weekend, she returned to the tournament in another statement-making outfit‚Äîthis one, perhaps, a subtle clapback at critics of her previous look.  The tennis champion hit the courts in Paris in a Virgil Abloh-designed Nike x Off-White ensemble. Sending a powerful message, the two-piece black and white set was emblazoned with the words "Mother," "Goddess," "Queen," and "Champion" in both French and English.   Let the Roland Garros begin. Here is my French Open look designed by @virgilabloh and @nike. A post shared by  Serena Williams (@serenawilliams) on May 26, 2019 at 6:00am PDT Serena debuted the look for her first round match against Russian tennis player Vitalia Diatchenko, which she won. This is the second time Abloh designed a performance look for the athlete to wear to a match‚Äîshe previously wore an Off-White x Nike tutu dress to the U.S. Open last year. The statement-making jacket comes a year after Williams was criticized for wearing a full-length bodysuit which she dedicated to ‚Äúall the moms out there who had a tough recovery from pregnancy.‚Äù The full body compression garment was designed to help prevent blood clots‚Äîan issue Williams suffered from in the past that led to a near-death experience during the birth of her daughter.  But despite the outfit's potential life-saving functionality, the French Open implemented a stricter dress code right after Williams wore it. Bernard Giudicelli, president of the French Tennis Federation, told Tennis magazine that Serena's catsuit was specifically a problem. ‚ÄúIt will no longer be accepted. One must respect the game and the place,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI think that sometimes we‚Äôve gone too far.‚Äù At the time, the tennis champion didn't seem phased by the French Open's decision to implement a new dress code, and her latest look is just another reminder she's still the G.O.A.T.‚Äîdespite what any of her outfit critics have to say. 
 "Maybe this is something that is needed in a way." Selma Blair's honesty regarding her multiple sclerosis diagnosis has been nothing but enlightening.  In her candid interview with Vanity Fair, Blair lamented the lack of accessible, comfortable and fashionable clothing for individuals with chronic illnesses and disabilities. The actress name-dropped her friend, designer Christian Siriano, as her dream collaborator on an accessible fashion. And now, Siriano has responded in a new interview with People. In many ways, Siriano sounds like the perfect fit for Blair's project, as his line has always been dedicated to making inclusive fashion for everyone. And according to Siriano, the collaboration isn't completely out of the question, as he tells People, "Selma and I talked about it at dinner. What‚Äôs happening with her is so unreal, so I was like, 'Well maybe this is something that is needed in a way,' so we'll see. I don't know yet but maybe."  As Blair told Vanity Fair, "I would like to partner with someone like Christian Siriano on a line for everyone‚Äînot just people who necessarily need adaptive clothing, but for those who want comfort, too. It can still be chic. You shouldn‚Äôt have to sacrifice style. Like, let‚Äôs get elastic waistbands to look a little bit better." The Hellboy actress added, "I really feel like people with disabilities are invisible to a lot of people. Because they‚Äôre uncomfortable, or don‚Äôt have the energy to dress up, don‚Äôt want to be seen." If Siriano and Blair do decide to work together, people living with chronic illnesses and disabilities could finally have access to fashion that works for them.

   With many warm-weather vacations on the docket to help us get through the winter‚Äîwe're always on the lookout for well-traveled pieces. That search led us to We Are Leone, a 2-year old brand created by Ruby and Tallulah Rufus Isaacs.  The stylish sisters were born in Los Angeles, grew up in Rome and have since lived in London, Paris, and now Switzerland and Modena. Through their travels around the world, the girls were inspired to create a line of duster jackets that can take you from city to beach. The bold silk jackets, with often eye-catching prints are the perfect piece to up your vacation Instagram game. Below, we chatted with the jet-setting Rufus Isaacs about their vision and what it's like to start a brand with your sister.  Tallulah: The brand originally started while I was living in Paris. I had a store called The Space which was Elizabeth Taylor's old store‚ÄîI sold everything from emerging brands to art work and art deco furniture. I had a store in Paris and Ruby was designing for a boutique in London called Austiques. The two of us wanted to re-create pieces from our mother's wardrobe that we shared between the two of us for years and sourced fabrics from our many travels‚Äîmainly silks from Como. After posting pictures on Instagram of us wearing our creations friends and stores started reaching out, asking us to make pieces for them as well. I later moved to Switzerland for love and closed my shop, Ruby also moved to Modena, and we decided to create We Are Leone and work full time on it.

We design everything together but each of us bring our own inspiration from things we have spotted in our day and work on incorporating it together. We both use our skill sets from our past experiences to the best of our ability but essentially we handle everything side by side.

We always give one another room for what the other believes in and we think that helps us target more women and different tastes. We both pay attention to very different details and point things out the other may not notice. For example a walk to get coffee in the morning Ruby may notice a beautiful tile pattern on a door step of someone's home or Tallulah looking through a pack or tarot cards and spotting a design she loves. The hardest part - neither of us can think of one! She is easy going, loves to feel comfortable but also be bold. She is ageless. She travels for the love of seeing the world and also for work. She can wear heels or flats and be dressed up or down and still make heads turn in a room. She loves simplicity and quality. She is bright. She is educated and most of all she is strong.

Our Spring 2018 collection which will be our first season wholesaling ( we have been picked up by the likes of Barneys, Net a Porter, Selfridges, Elyse Walker)  is inspired by our move to Los Angeles and our summer spent in Italy. Finding the unison between American simplicity but being able to wear something to dinner in Milan with slicked back hair and no make up and having the Italian girl who never dares to ask what you are wearing ask.

 See one of fall‚Äôs biggest trend pieces, styled in three completely different ways. Ask any woman if they have a go-to outfit for a job interview or a first date, and hands down, they do. There's no denying that certain articles of clothing can make you feel instantly more powerful, give you a major confidence boost, or transform you into the sexiest version of yourself.  The menswear blazer, one of this season's biggest trends, is one of them. Watch these three very different women‚Äîa BAZAAR editor, an e-commerce director, and an entrepreneur-slash-influencer‚Äîstyle it their own unique way.

 The Twitter Queen has a new collection of blue light glasses necessary for shading trolls.  It's easy to forget we're not actually best friends with Chrissy Teigen. Whether she's cracking jokes or clapping back at trolls, the model/unofficial Queen of Twitter remains the most relatable celebrity on the Internet‚Äîwhich is why her latest project, a collaboration with Quay Australia, makes perfect sense.  Yes, sunglasses are an on-brand venture for someone who excels at throwing shade, but what's more fitting is that Teigen's Quay collection also includes a range of blue light glasses, to be worn while endlessly scrolling Twitter and Instagram, of course. If you haven't yet tried the technology, which blocks potentially harmful blue HEV light from phone, TV, and computer screens, Teigen will convince you it's time. She credits them with helping alleviate dry, sore eyes and headaches. And if that's not enticing enough, she says she and John wear them "in bed at night while watching TV and scrolling the ‚Äògram." Consider me influenced.  Along with the blue light glasses, the Chrissy x Quay collection includes a range of the brand's best-selling sunglasses in new retro-inspired shapes and muted tones for fall. True to the brand's affordable price point, all eyewear in the collection ranges from $50 to $60.   Below, Teigen chats with BAZAAR.com about her go-to spec styles (bigger is better), how to avoid Internet burnout, and how she's limiting her kids' screen time.  I've been coming across Quay for years through friends who‚Äôve done partnerships and collaborations with them, and seeing them on Instagram all the time. They sent me a bunch [of sunglasses] and every time I've worn them, I get all these compliments. I have so many pairs of sunglasses in every price range, but it's always the Quay ones that I get compliments on. I was super excited to be part of something with them. I knew the styles that were best for my face, but obviously we wanted a collection that was accommodating of everyone's different styles and face shapes. I tend to lean towards oversized sunglasses because I don't love putting on a full face of makeup every day. We took the brand's shapes that people already know and love and changed the colors to enhance them and make them more my style. We went a little bit darker for fall and there are some mirror sunglasses, too.   They're stylish but also serve a purpose. We're all addicted to our phones, our screen time, TV‚Äîwe're constantly scrolling something. We want to get people to open their eyes to the fact that these glasses could be beneficial. [After wearing them], I noticed I was getting less headaches, better sleep, and no more sore, dry eyes. I wear them at night when I'm in bed and John wears his so much. He needs a thick prescription, so we‚Äôll both be in bed at night wearing our glasses while watching TV and scrolling the ‚Äògram.  In 10 years we're going to look back and be like, oh my God, I can't believe we weren't all wearing these things. Everybody notices a huge difference in their sleep when they put their phones away before bed or wear these types of glasses. They‚Äôre comfortable, so you‚Äôre able to live your life while wearing them, which is good since I do watch TV like 24 hours a day, basically. I wear them while I‚Äôm cooking and looking at my computer for recipes too.  It's important to find that balance. My kids now take away a lot of my time, so I'm able to give myself that break. But there are times where I cannot put my phone down. We don't get a break from news these days, but putting my phone down, going out and playing with my kids, and just trying to forget about things for a moment is really important.  These mental breaks are really important. Using the mute feature on Twitter is incredibly important. It‚Äôs important to curate your own feed because what we're seeing is all up to us, right? It's who we follow and not something that you can get away from, really. For me, the second I hear certain [trigger] words, I just turn my brain off and I'm like, nope, I'm not finishing this video. I can‚Äòt hear what he has to say anymore. There are certain things that I‚Äôve trained myself not to listen to anymore and it helps a lot. Stress is huge for people these days and it really is going to be such an illness‚Äîanother thing we‚Äôre going to look back on. You have to take care of your own personal mental health. There's some days that you can take it and that's great, but on the days you can't, it's fine to just be offline. You don't have to always be on the grid. You really have to take care of your own personal mental health. You don't always have to be on the grid.  You have to keep them involved in things they love and be a master at distraction. Luna will beg to use my phone, like beg, in bed because there‚Äôs an app she loves. But there are certain situations, like when you‚Äôre on a plane or in a restaurant, where goddammit, it's going to help those surrounding us. We are not those people that are like no screen time! So, you try to download all the coolest learning activities so at least they're learning something.  It affects kids‚Äô sleep schedules too. Even if they just watch TV during the day, when they go to sleep they think back on it. Luna loves scary stuff and watching Hocus Pocus, and now she's really into the old Mary Kate and Ashley movies. There's a scary Halloween one, and even if she watches it during the day, she'll be scared at night. And the thing is, kids are only crazy about something for a minute. So if you can get through a minute of that screaming and begging while you think of something else like an art project, a book or stickers, they forget they even wanted it in the first place. You have to get super amped about something else and they will match that excitement, and that's how you deal with it.  That was the biggest part of why I wanted to be in this campaign. Not only is the company full of incredible people, but being able to give away a total of $100,000 to ten different people is going to be really incredible. We live in times where it's so hard to get any kind of grant or loan or scholarships for school and people need that. People are excited to be the change in the world, to be able to learn and gain knowledge, but also to be able to have a life where they're able to travel and see the world. This money is going to help them do all of those things. When you're financially set in one part of your life, you're able to enjoy the other parts more too. To be able to pick strong candidates that really embody the entire campaign and want to be the change the world needs right now is going to be fun. It's going to be really hard to choose people because there are going to be so many amazing people that are going to apply to be a part of it‚Äîthat's what I'm most nervous about, only having ten. Hopefully this is a campaign and scholarship program that continues on with whoever comes after me. But I'm excited to see young people so excited to be the change that we need.
 The "fourth trimester" holistic wellness movement prescribes some TLC. The future duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle, started practicing with her yoga-teacher mother when she was seven. These days Baby Archie could get his om on at an even earlier age, thanks to the proliferation of baby-and-me studios like Love Child in New York. Designed for the under-12-months set and their parents, classes teach everything from infant massage and bonding exercises to restorative poses to help parents cope with sleep deprivation. Baby-and-me yoga is just one of the ‚Äúfourth-trimester‚Äù holistic wellness practices adopted by new mothers like the Tot‚Äôs Nasiba Adilova.      Another must-have for the first 90 days‚Äô postpartum? A soft cotton tummy wrap from the London-based celebrity obstetrician Gowri Motha. Derived from traditional belly-binding practices in India and Malaysia, these gentle girdles help support internal organs. Devotees of the fourth trimester lifestyle also swear by an Ayurvedic diet, a sequence of nourishing, warm foods intended to help the body heal. Key dishes include kitchari, a basmati-rice porridge made with split mung beans and turmeric; bone-broth ramen; and red curry with sweet potato noodles. Bon app√©tit.  Natural Wonders From a retractable pacifier to supermom Karolina Kurkova‚Äôs botanical washes, the latest baby products are as innovative as they are stylish. 
 Mini-Me Will the ‚ÄúMeghan Markle effect‚Äù translate to baby fashion? Perhaps, as a number of her favorite brands now come in pint sizes, including a ballet-flat version of the duchess‚Äôs go-to Aquazzura Deneuve bow pumps and a ‚ÄúMini Givenchy‚Äù romper.

 20 daily newspapers, 10 cans of diet coke, 7 hours of sleep ‚Ä¶ The designer shares his schedule. This piece was originally published on March 16, 2012. We‚Äôre republishing it now following the news that iconic Chanel creative director Karl Lagerfeld died on Tuesday, February 19, 2019 at the age of 85. The house of Chanel confirmed the news on Instagram, with Chanel CEO Alain Wertheimer writing, ‚ÄúThanks to his creative genius, generosity and exceptional intuition, Karl Lagerfeld was ahead of his time, which widely contributed to the House of Chanel success throughout the world.‚Äù Harper‚Äôs BAZAAR editor in chief Glenda Bailey remembered the designer in a touching essay, writing, ‚ÄúThe world is a less beautiful place today. Karl Lagerfeld was a visionary right until the end. His mastery‚Äîof fabric, design, silhouette, and the very process of creative reinvention‚Äîwas a breathtaking thing to behold ‚Ä¶ There will never be another Karl. He will live on in our hearts‚Äîand the pages of Bazaar‚Äîforever.‚Äù Revisit Lagerfeld‚Äôs 100 greatest Chanel runway moments here. 8:00 A.M. I sleep seven hours. If I go to bed at two, I wake up at nine. If I go to bed at midnight, I wake up at seven. I don't wake up before‚Äîthe house can fall apart, but I sleep for seven hours. I wear a long, full-length white shirt, in a material called poplin imperial, made for me by Hilditch & Key in Paris after a design of a 17th-century men's nightshirt I saw at the Victoria and Albert Museum. The first thing I do when I get up, I have breakfast. I have two protein shakes made for me by my doctor‚Äîthey have a chocolate taste and no sugar, of course‚Äîand steamed apples. That's all. I don't like anything else in the morning. I never drink anything hot; I don't like hot drinks, very strange. I drink Diet Coke from the minute I get up to the minute I go to bed. I can even drink it in the middle of the night, and I can sleep. I don't drink coffee, I don't drink tea, I drink nothing else. I do most of my reading in the morning. I have a special canopy for that, near the window, where I can see the Louvre and the Seine. I only read, look at books, and sketch. And daydream‚Äîdaydreaming's important too. At night there are the dreams too, but I don't have too many. I read the French, English, and some American papers, some German papers, Women's Wear‚Äîquite a lot. I read on paper; I prefer that. "I drink Diet Coke from the minute I get up to the minute I go to bed." 11:00 A.M. I have my hair done because I hate to have hair in my face when I sketch. My hair is not really white; it's kind of grayish, and I don't like the color. So I make it totally white with Klorane dry shampoo. That is the best thing to do because my hair is always clean.  12:00 P.M. I don't get dressed and take a bath until lunchtime because I am doing a dirty job, painting with colors. So I wear my long nightshirt; it becomes kind of like a painter's smock, then it goes to the laundry. I have everything‚Äîsheets and nightshirt and robes‚Äîchanged every day. I like everything to be washable, myself included. I like antique lace, antique sheets, beautiful quilted covers, but everything is white. In white you can hide nothing. Most people don't use this kind of sheets and things because it's very difficult and very expensive for the upkeep. But it's such a pleasure to go to bed in the evening in a beautiful bed with beautiful sheets and beautiful pillows, everything flawless, in a freshly pressed, long white smock. It's perfect. When I'm ready, I soak in the bathtub, if you really want to know. I used to have a product I loved, by Shu Uemura, but they don't make it anymore, so I found a French product that softens the water; it's a hundred years old. I put half a bottle in the bathtub. I exercise very little because my doctor said it's not necessary. I did a lot when I was very young, and all you do when you're young stays. So it's not the problem as with people who started later. I'm very flexible; I have no problems. "I exercise very little because my doctor said it's not necessary. I did a lot when I was very young, and all you do when you're young stays." My latest uniform is actually two looks‚Äîa special jacket with tails made by Dior, but not what you wear for weddings. I have them made in tweed and things like this. Then I have another jacket I love from the new Dior men's collection that I bought five of, so people think I wear the same thing every day, but in fact it's never the same thing. And then I wear jeans; at the moment they are from my new collection. They are dark gray with my face, my profile, printed in black on them, but you really have to look at it to see it. My dressing room is so full that I can only wear what I see on top of all the racks. I still have all my clothes from 10 years ago from Dior, but I think I will give them back to Dior for the museum. I have pieces that are unique pieces that I will never wear again, because life is different now, you know. I used to fax a lot, but people don't have faxes anymore. I never have lunch, but when I do, I ask them to bring it to me in the house. I actually have two houses. This house here, it's only for sleeping and sketching, and I have another house two-and-a-half meters away for lunch and dinner and to see people, and where the cook is and all that. I don't want that here. Even if the place is huge, I want to be alone. If I want something, I call them, and they're next door, they come. The studio is next door, the office is next door. If I have guests and butlers, I don't want them in my house. Everything is next door. 4:00 P.M. I have two drivers and several cars. I have a driver who in the morning does the shopping for me and brings the newspapers, and another one, S√©bastien, who is also my secretary, who is free in the morning and works in the afternoon and late in the evening. On my way to the Chanel studio, I like to look around, I like to look at Paris. I never get tired of Paris. A lot of people are on the phone all the time; they don't see anything anymore. It's true. I like to watch. I go from here to Galignani, my favorite bookshop, and then to Chanel, and then to Colette, and sometimes to the Dior men's shop. I don't go to too many shops. 5:00 P.M. I arrive at the studio very late in the afternoon because I want the premi√®re to stay in the workroom with the workers during the day. If they are in the studio with me, they don't supervise the work. I go there from five to eight, half-past eight. I'm very quick and organized. The way I sketch, the way I work, I prefer to do all my work in the evening or in the morning and during the weekend, and I send everything on the iPhone. I'm not there in the studio draping‚ÄîI don't do those things. My work is very conceptual. "I actually have two houses. This house here, it's only for sleeping and sketching, and I have another house two-and-a-half meters away for lunch and dinner and to see people, and where the cook is and all that. I don't want that here." 9:00 P.M. Dinner depends on the day. I don't go out that much because I'm always late, and I'm so busy and so pleased with what I'm doing that I'm not really ready for a social evening. That's over‚Äîthe people I was going out with are dead or don't exist anymore. Sometimes I go to La Maison du Caviar, but most of the time I have dinner in the Rue des Saints-P√®res house and come home after that. I hate the word routine. What I hate most is when you have to look at your watch and get in a hurry to change for dinner, if you have an important dinner. Every dinner is important; you should never be without a dinner, but this I'm a little tired of. I did a lot of it in my life. To unwind, it depends on how tired I am. Sometimes I read a little bit. Lately, I play with my cat, Choupette. The cat always stays home, and when I leave, the maid takes care of her. The cat is like a very refined object; she doesn't go into the street, and she doesn't go to other places. She is a spoiled princess. Related Video: The Comedown with Karl Lagerfeld

 We're taking notes for the winter months ahead.  Whether they're rocking puffer coats or lots of layers, the Russian style set know a thing or two about how to stay warm. 
 "Cash inside."  Many of us guard our handbags with our lives, but when you reach a certain level of rich, you buy a $1,300 designer bag, fill it with cash, and dare the plebeians to come open it. A new goal to work toward, kids!  Off-White's latest collection of bags takes its tongue-in-cheek "logo" designs to another level. Its new range is emblazoned with the words "cash inside," along with literal directions to open the bag‚Äîmaking it a thief's dream come true.    Do people even carry cash anymore? All that's in my purse are old receipts, gum wrappers, and 10 different lipstick shade options. Maybe that's part of the joke that rich people are playing on us all. Or is Virgil Abloh simply trolling us? Who's to know for sure, but either way, you can expect these bags to fully dominate the street style scene come Fashion Month this September.  The bags come in five sizes and styles‚Äîfrom a classic shoulder bag that's available for $1,035 to a mini cross-body version that retails for $609. But can you really put a price on daring people to rob you in this economy? I think not.  Cash, it seems, is trying to stage a comeback in the fashun world this season. Along with Abloh's new crop of Off-White bags, earlier this week, Alexander Wang debuted his latest campaign featuring Anna Ewers sitting on a couch full of cash. You heard it here first: The vintage form of money is now chic again. Your credit cards and Apple Pay are shaking.   She's not a paper chaser. She's a money maker. - Presenting #TheWangHustle, starring @annaewers in Collection 2 2019. - Shop the collection online and in-store worldwide. - Photo by @hugocomte Styled by @haleywollens A post shared by  alexanderwang (@alexanderwangny) on Jul 23, 2019 at 8:48am PDT
 Add these pieces to your closet ASAP. Now that we're past the doldrums of winter, it's finally time to start thinking about spring. While wearing sundresses and tank tops may still be a little ways away, accessories are one area where you can start warming things up.  Here, five of the biggest spring accessories trends that you can start wearing immediately. There's a little something for all tastes, from raffia details for the boho babe to minimalist sandals for the city slicker. Materials like raffia and woven straw instantly bring a warm-weather vibe to any outfit. These earthy colors and natural textures really pop against bright white, but also look great with pastels and darker neutrals. The big throwback of the season are minimalist sandals reminiscent of the 1990s and early 2000s. Think thin straps and simple, neutral colors. Inject a futuristic feel into your spring look with crystal clear PVC details. Maximize the otherworldly look with metallic accents and an eyeliner in an unexpected pop color, like teal or hot pink. The fanny pack of yore gets a new life in the form of a belt bag. There‚Äôs only one way to style it, though‚Äîwear like a crossbody for a cool street-style look. One of the most prevalent trends this season has been brewing for a while. Handcrafted and artisanal touches are considered the new luxury, and their arty effects have been popping up everywhere from bags to earrings.
 Plus links to buy now, of course... A little black dress or Le Smoking suit is always on par for the party scene, but who says holiday dressing has to be so cut and dry? From pink jackets to leather dresses, here are some not-so-basic ideas for giving festive a whole new name this holiday season. Come out of your comfort zone and put on something bold, or sparkly. We love the mix of bare skin and easy hair with a super bold pink Versace look. If a whole suit feels like a lot, ease in with a vibrant jacket paired with jeans or basic trousers.  This jacket will get you looks and compliments. A little white dress and diamonds or crystal jewelry is such a classic holiday mix, but it never feels tired. Just look at Rihanna. This fetching dress works for occasion dressing, but is also great for any weekend affair.¬† Put a little bling on it... While certainly a staple, red velvet never had it so cool as in this mini Khaite dress on Anna Baryshinkov.  This is our childhood dream dress, all grown up. While wearing black to a holiday party may not seem revolutionary, this mix of proportions on Kaia Gerber is what makes the look. It's all about a flare pant and unbuttoned-from-the-top blouse. Unbutton as many buttons as you wish... While not every woman is down for some sequins, it can't hurt to let yourself shine every now and then... Officially not for the wall flower. Is there anything cooler than a slinky skirt and your boyfriend's button down? Elsa Hosk proves probably not in Balenciaga. This unisex shirt will give you that bf vibe without going too oversized.¬† Turn the holiday blues around once and for all. ¬† Bring that ladies-who-lunch posh to any party. Paired with jeans, a great boucle jacket, like this one by Chanel on Katie Holmes, is always a good idea. White pumps complete the fresh look. A true staple, in long or short. Wear for holidays and beyond... We love that this Bella Hadid look is menswear-inspired by way of pinstripes, but couldn't be less boyish in shape. This subtle flare and fitted silhouette make these trousers so much more than workwear. Try them¬†with a fitted waistcoat. Make a seasonal statement in leather a la JLo in this Zimmermann look. Top off this or any other look. A true statement piece that will never look dated.¬†
 Moncler Genius unveiled another stunning collaboration with Valentino's Pierpaolo Piccioli. The Internet has been collectively losing it over the now-viral "Amazon Coat." But for those looking for something a little less basic from their outerwear, allow Moncler to introduce you to puffer coat couture gowns.  Bringing their "Moncler Genius" design series to Milan Fashion Week for a second time, the brand unveiled a series of avant garde puffer coats in collaboration with designers including Richard Quinn, Simone Rocha, and Valentino's Pierpaolo Piccioli. Standing out as the most grandiose of them all was the capsule with Piccioli, which brought forth a series of dramatic puffer couture gowns. Done in collaboration with model Liya Kebede, the Moncler x Piccioli gowns tapped eight Ethiopian artists from Kebede's ethical fashion brand, Lemlem, to bring the designs to life. The end result? A breathtaking collection of colorful puffer coat gowns that would make any of us happy to bundle up. Scroll down to see the stunning lookbook from the latest Moncler Genius presentation. 
 Do I need medical attention or are these Croc-inspired heels actually cute?  In its latest quest to make fetch Crocs happen, it seems Balenciaga may have actually succeeded. I know, I know, these are the same shoes that kids wear to Disneyland and your grandma wears due to doctor's orders, but Balenciaga's latest take on the rubber footwear is surprisingly chic.   The brand introduced a Croc-inspired, hot pink stiletto pump that looks straight out of Barbie's Dream House. The ultra-pointy rubber heel somehow even manages to look cool with its kitschy, Croc-inspired pins and embellishments typically reserved for those who still partake in recess.  Despite the fact that these shoes look half Croc, half real-life Barbie shoe, I still think I want a pair (yes, I still have 911 on standby, just in case). First of all, they're great for gardening my dying apartment plants in:  A post shared by Balenciaga (@balenciaga) on Jul 17, 2018 at 6:12am PDT And you can also hear the sound of the apocalypse coming when you put them up to your ear: A post shared by Balenciaga (@balenciaga) on Jul 4, 2018 at 6:43am PDT Of course, the price of the Croc-inspired heels has yet to be announced, but you can expect them to go for slightly higher than a pair of $40 Crocs (think upwards of $1,000). It's unclear whether this is a collaboration with Crocs, or if Balenciaga just took inspiration from the shoe, but this isn't the first time the fashion house has introduced it's luxury take on the rubber footwear The brand previously sent sky-high platform Crocs down its Spring 2018 runway, but those shoes were slightly less wearable than the new Barbie pink stilettos.  If the Year of Our Lord 2018 has taught us anything, it's that the most insane of things is possible, even a pair of Crocs looking decidedly cool.

 The group stars in an unretouched campaign as the new #AerieREAL Role Model family.  Back in 2014, Aerie committed to Photoshop-free ads‚Äîbecoming a major player in fashion's body positivity movement. The lingerie brand has since tapped model Iskra Lawrence to front many of its campaigns, appointing her as a positive #AerieREAL Role Model.  Today, the brand announced the expansion of its #AerieREAL Role Model family with three new faces: actress/activist Yara Shahidi, Olympic gold medal gymnast Aly Raisman, and singer Rachel Platten. Joining forces with Iskra, the three young women appear together in Aerie's latest unretouched campaign for Spring 2018.     ‚ÄúYara, Aly, Rachel, and Iskra truly embody AerieREAL and what it means to be strong, confident, and happy in your own skin. At Aerie, we believe in authentic, real beauty and never airbrush our models. Now, more than ever, we want to encourage women everywhere to feel empowered to embrace their own unique qualities and beautiful REAL selves," Jennifer Foyle, Aerie Global Brand President, said in a statement from the brand.  In addition to the spring ads, all four Aerie Role Models will further the brand's mission of female empowerment by speaking on "Real Talk" panels at Aerie stores across the country and designing a range of products with 100% of sales benefiting a charity of their choice. The exclusive designs by Yara, Aly, Rachel, and Iskra will be available to shop at Aerie starting this March.  SHOP THE ROLE MODELS' FAVORITE AERIE PIECES SHOP THE ROLE MODELS' FAVORITE AERIE PIECES With Yara's activism, Aly's brave account of her sexual assault, and Rachel's empowering songs, the three women make for the perfect additions to Aerie's feel-good, inspiring family of young role models.  
 
 The designer's star power is unstoppable.  Burberry's Spring 2019 show was undoubtedly one of the most anticipated shows of this year. With Christopher Bailey's departure after 17-years at the heritage brand, the reigns were passed on to Givenchy's former Creative Director Riccardo Tisci.  At Givenchy, the Italian designer was known for his romantic goth-inspired designs and celebrity-studded front rows. His power in Hollywood was also felt on the red carpet with countless iconic sartorial moments with some of the most stylish women in the world: Beyonce at the Met Gala, Cate Blanchett at the Academy Awards and Adele at the Grammys.  Tisci is bringing that same star power to the house of Burberry. Many of his former Givenchy muses like Rihanna and Madonna were quick to hit the streets in his new trench coats. The designer showed many iterations of the brand's most iconic item for his debut in September.  Tisci's debut show ran the gamut from classic suiting, whether with pants or skirts, to gowns and the coolest streetwear looks in between. The designer's most ardent supporters like supermodel Mariacarla Boscono was the first to wear one of the brand's new cocktail dresses to the amfAR Milano gala a week after she walked the Burberry runway. It Brit Carey Mulligan was sported around town showing us how best to wear the Burberry leather trousers‚Äîand M.I.A. so expertly hit the red carpet in one of the brand's newest streetwear looks.  Bureberry also created several custom looks for Beyonce for her On The Run II tour. An all-over Burberry check ensemble, as well as this corseted bodysuit with pearl embellishments and a matching studded trench for a classic nod to the brand. With award season quickly approaching we imagine we'll be seeing a lot more Hollywood's biggest Tisci-supporters in custom looks.

 The sci-fi superstar paints the town red. Plus, see a day in the life of the actress here.  At the Spotted Pig, the New York gastropub as celebrated for its famous patrons as for its char-grilled burger, the arrival of an actress best known for her work on the CW series The Vampire Diaries normally wouldn‚Äôt cause much of a stir. But when Nina Dobrev makes her entrance on a lovely evening in June, heads do turn‚Äîand not just because she is channeling Jackie Kennedy in an oversize pink coat by L.K. Bennett and Dior sunglasses. Dobrev‚Äôs canine companion, Maverick, an adorable and impeccably well-behaved border collie‚ÄìAustralian shepherd mix, is garnering her own fair share of attention. ‚ÄúI call her the world‚Äôs chillest dog,‚Äù Dobrev says as she settles into a corner booth with the puppy, who‚Äôs named, of course, after Tom Cruise‚Äôs character in Top Gun. She adopted Maverick from a shelter a few months back while still grieving the death of her beloved cat, Lynx (immortalized in many an Instagram post). ‚ÄúShe rescued me as much as I rescued her,‚Äù adds Dobrev. ‚ÄúI was so lost after Lynx passed, but Maverick brought me back to life.‚Äù "The things I want to do now aren't necessarily the things that are expected of me. I don't want to play a teenager anymore." The actress, 28, who plays a medical student who embarks on a group near-death experience in this month‚Äôs supernatural thriller Flatliners, is feeling under the weather. ‚ÄúI thought it was food poisoning, but today my throat just hurts and my head hurts,‚Äù she says, ordering a hot toddy. ‚ÄúI also had an IV this morning,‚Äù she offers, showing off the tiny hole in her arm and heartily endorsing the treatment, a nonprescription pick-me-up. ‚ÄúI got an anti-inflammatory, antinausea megadose of vitamin C and electrolytes, and I added B12 and something else.‚Äù When I reassure her that she‚Äôs the picture of health‚Äîangelic, in fact‚Äîshe shakes her head. ‚ÄúWomen are lucky because we get to cover it with makeup. You should have seen me 20 minutes ago!‚Äù Despite years in the limelight‚Äîsix seasons on The Vampire Diaries and four before that on Degrassi: The Next Generation‚ÄîDobrev is intent on maintaining her regular-girl humility. Her family emigrated from Bulgaria to Toronto when she was two, and they struggled financially for years. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt come from money,‚Äù she explains. ‚ÄúIn the beginning, we lived with another family in a one-bedroom apartment. My parents had to work really hard.‚Äù While her friends all had ‚Äúelaborate wardrobes,‚Äù she says, her family shopped at a local thrift store, Value Village. To take the sting out, her mom nicknamed the store ‚ÄúVersace.‚Äù Meanwhile, the adolescent Nina pored over self-help books‚Äî‚ÄúThe Secret or something like that‚Äù‚Äîand willed good fortune to come her way. It seems to have worked. ‚ÄúEventually I got to go to an actual Versace fashion show and sit in the front row,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúAnd now I go to vintage stores on purpose. It‚Äôs funny how your perspective changes.‚Äù That modest background helped shape her political views as well. ‚ÄúI come from an immigrant family, and I think it‚Äôs unacceptable to treat anyone like that,‚Äù Dobrev, who now lives in Los Angeles, says of Donald Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúbuild the wall‚Äù rhetoric. ‚ÄúHopefully he‚Äôll get impeached. Or indicted. Or both. He just doesn‚Äôt act like a president. He acts like a reality star on a terrible, horrible show that should never be aired. And he‚Äôs responsible for incredibly important decisions for the country that I live in, so my opinion does matter whether or not I had a chance to vote.‚Äù Still, Dobrev knows that her vocal support for Hillary Clinton may have cost her a few fans. ‚ÄúWhenever I did one of those posts, I was inundated with negative comments, some of the most horrific things I‚Äôve ever seen written,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm entitled to my opinion, and if you don‚Äôt want to see the things I‚Äôm saying, don‚Äôt follow me.‚Äù  Besides, there‚Äôs plenty of other material on Dobrev‚Äôs feed‚Äîmost notably the videos of her engaging in various daredevil adventures: skydiving, rock climbing, bungee jumping, swimming with sharks, wakeboarding, and even riding a water-powered hoverboard. During one Vampire Diaries hiatus, she even backpacked alone in Europe and East Asia without having booked a single hotel room or planned an itinerary. ‚ÄúMy rule of thumb is, I‚Äôll try anything once,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI have a healthy‚Äîor possibly unhealthy‚Äîobsession with trying things for the first time.‚Äù Despite the show‚Äôs rabid fan base around the world, Dobrev went totally unrecognized. ‚ÄúNobody imagines me to be by myself backpacking, so they just think, ‚ÄòIt can‚Äôt be her.‚Äô‚Äù It‚Äôs a pretty bold list of hobbies, especially for someone who says she gets anxious when she‚Äôs away from her puppy. But that seeming contradiction‚Äîthe tension between Dobrev‚Äôs grit and her vulnerability‚Äîis what makes her so appealing onscreen. Which isn‚Äôt to say she‚Äôs fearless in real life: She almost bailed on that bungee jump at the last second. ‚ÄúEvery cell in your body is like, ‚ÄòWhy would you do this?‚Äô ‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúPlus, unlike skydiving, you can see the rocks clearly and imagine what would happen if you went splat.‚Äù Of course, Dobrev‚Äôs most infamous leap into the unknown was her decision in 2015 to leave The Vampire Diaries, sending fans, costars, and network executives into a tailspin. Though it seemed like a surprising choice, Dobrev insists that she never considered staying beyond her six-year contract. ‚ÄúThat was the plan from the get-go,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIf anything, the fact that [leaving] terrified me drove me even more. I needed to feel that fear of ‚ÄòOh, my God, what if I never get a job again?‚Äô That just made me want to work five times as hard to make sure that didn‚Äôt happen.‚Äù "I have a healthy‚Äîor possibly unhealthy‚Äîobsession with trying things for the first time." Her roles since have been sparse (xXx: Return of Xander Cage and the upcoming Crash Pad and Departures), but that‚Äôs only because ‚Äúthe things I want to do aren‚Äôt necessarily the things that are expected of me,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to play a teenager anymore. I want to play adult roles and be challenged and work with great filmmakers and tell incredible stories, and that has meant being really picky.‚Äù Dobrev has also been working behind the scenes. She‚Äôs set to produce one movie and co-write another, and she‚Äôs also directing a short film. Meanwhile, she‚Äôs in New York to hone her comedic chops, taking an Improv 101 class with the Upright Citizens Brigade. A few days after our dinner, she‚Äôll appear in the final showcase, scrambling with a classmate to invent a sketch on the fly based on a word suggested by an audience member. But even with her bona fides on TV and the big screen, Dobrev is nervous. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs scary. I might crash and burn, but that‚Äôs how I‚Äôm going to get better at it,‚Äù she says. The medical students in Flatliners take some pretty crazy risks too, inducing their own near deaths in order to investigate the afterlife. As for Dobrev, she thinks we‚Äôre simply not meant to know what happens when we die. She mentions a widely held theory of reincarnation. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like people say, if you do something really bad, you come back as an animal, but I think it‚Äôs the opposite,‚Äù she says, giving her puppy‚Äôs neck a good scratch. ‚ÄúRight, Maverick? When you fulfill your destiny and do everything you were meant to do, maybe that‚Äôs when you come back as a dog and get to eat and sleep and cuddle all day and have the best life ever!‚Äù Lead Image: DKNY jacket, $149, sport bra, $39, and pants, $89, dkny.com; Casato ring, $6,750, and choker, prince upon request, casatogioielli.com.; Hair: Peter Butler; Makeup: Matin; Manicure: Elle; Production: Allison Lange for Rosco Production.

 Jacquemus debuted an even tinier micro bag at Paris Fashion Week Honey I Shrunk the Kids, but make it fashion. Mini handbags have been reigning supreme for the past few seasons, but the trend continues to shrink smaller and smaller. Kicking off Paris Fashion Week, Jacquemus debuted the teeniest, tiniest handbags on its Fall 2019 runway.  The fashion brand has already become known for its ultra-mini bags and fanny packs. But it ventured into new territory with handbags so small they can barely fit a single pair of AirPods. Leave all your baggage behind in last season, hunny!  Before its latest micro bags hit the runway, the show's invites appropriately came in mini lavender Jacquemus bags and envelopes.  ¬´¬†LA COLLECTIONNEUSE¬†¬ª JACQUEMUS WINTER 2019/20 SHOW INVITATION  SEE YOU TOMOROW ( WITH MORE MINI CHIQUITO...) LOVE A post shared by  JACQUEMUS (@jacquemus) on Feb 24, 2019 at 9:10am PST In the collection, the bags accompanied bold monochromatic looks in striking pinks and reds. Aptly called the "Mini Le Chiquito" bag, the accessory debuted in white, pink, and red colorways. The perfect size for fitting two Advils, a single piece of gum, and perhaps a pair of AirPods (if you're lucky), this is the definition of leaving your baggage at the door.  And a zoomed-in shot just in case you don't have your glasses on:    While the latest mini Jacquemus bags won't be available to shop until next season, the brand's current in-season collection of micro bags range in price from $345 to $795. Ah, fash-un!  

 Bet you never thought you'd want to wear these trends again... From scrunchies to tube tops, logomania, and even visors, some of the most embarrassing trends of the past three decades are making unexpected fashion comebacks.

Unclear, but the hat alternative is having a chic revival, thanks in part to Dior.

 The brand releases another uplifting commercial.  From its diverse, star-studded "Bridging the Gap" video to the "Meet Me in The Gap" campaign starring Cher and Future, Gap has been using music and fashion to unify and inspire people all year long‚Äîand its holiday commercial is no different.  The brand tapped actress and singer Janelle Monae to lead a group sing-a-long for a holiday video that is impossible to watch without smiling. Featuring choirs of both adults and kids, the happy group celebrates togetherness while singing an acoustic rendition of Freddie Scott's "You Got What I Need."  "I love the unity of the ‚ÄòMeet Me in the Gap‚Äô concept. It really reflects the idea that although we may be from different parts of the world, when we come together, we can create something magical," Monae said in a statement from the brand.  Along with the feel-good vibe of that video, what's also note-worthy is the fact that the brand is bringing back its iconic rainbow-striped sweaters (you know, the ones you loved to wear growing up). Between the colorful stripes and the plush white and black faux fur coat Monae wears, there's plenty of Gap pieces to put on your shopping list ASAP.  Gap sweater, $70, SHOP

 It's a pioneering move. French advertisements will now carry a disclaimer if an image has been photoshopped. It's no secret that women's bodies are retouched to look slimmer, smoother and firmer in campaigns, but the French government is addressing this as a public health issue. Any commercial image that has used Photoshop will feature the message "Photographie retouch√©e", which translates to "edited photograph". The BBC reports that anyone who violates the rule will be fined ‚Ç¨37,500 ($44,042) or 30 percent of the cost of creating the ad. "Exposing young people to normative and unrealistic images of bodies leads to a sense of self-depreciation and poor self-esteem that can impact health-related behavior," Health Minister Marisol Touraine said. While it is "simplistic" to assume that retouched adverts cause eating disorders, a spokesperson for Beat‚Äîwhich supports victims of anorexia, bulimia and binge-eating - praised the move. "We support any measures that contribute to a society having a healthier view of body types and everyone being more aware of which pictures have been touched up," said Beat's Tom Quinn. "Moving towards a society where there isn't the same pressure on models and the general public to be as thin as possible will be very welcome."

 It's her first time addressing the VSFS since she dropped out. Even though Gigi Hadid couldn't walk the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show in Shanghai this year, that didn't stop her from cheering on her little sister Bella from the sidelines. The model gave a shoutout to her younger sibling on her Instagram Story tonight, before the show was broadcast.  "Excited to watch my gorg lil sis (so proud @bellahadid) and all my angelic friends tonight #vsfs," she captioned a photo of Bella on the runway. "HUGE LOVE to all the girls and the whole VS team!!" she added. "A year of prep and hard work deserves celebration!!!!!!!" This marks the first time Hadid has mentioned the VS fashion show since she unexpectedly announced she would not be walking in Shanghai. Though she didn't give a reason for her absence, it was reported that she was denied a Chinese visa for posting a video where she appeared to mock Asian people. However, Hadid already looks ready for the 2018 fashion show. "Already can't wait for next year!" she tweeted. I‚Äôm so bummed I won‚Äôt be able to make it to China this year. Love my VS family, and will be with all my girls in spirit!! Can't wait to tune in with everyone to see the beautiful show I know it will be, and already can't wait for next year! :) x
 My ankles are shaking.  The '90s were a great time in fashion. So great, in fact, that we can't stop‚Äìwon't stop reviving trends from the decade over and over again. From mom jeans to tiny sunglasses and bucket hats, we've seen the return of many of the era's key pieces over the last few years. The latest (and perhaps most polarizing yet) comes from Steve Madden, who's bringing back two of its iconic '90s platform sandals for Summer 2019.  They're the shoes you spent a large chunk of the '90s teetering through the mall or school hallways in (worn with a pair of capri pants, obviously). They're also the shoes that made aggressively loud flopping noises as you stomped around in all your teenage angst glory. And now, they're back for Summer 2019 in a new collaboration with Steve Madden and Urban Outfitters (though they may not have the same effect when worn to Hudson Yards).     Flip flops are a polarizing enough shoe trend on their own. But platform flip flops? Our country can't possibly take any more division. My ankles and soul feel triggered. And yet, you can bet a batch of influencers and street style stars will somehow make me nostalgic enough to want a pair this summer.  But if you're really team anti-flip flop, Steve Madden also revived its iconic Slinky platform sandals for the collaboration. Offered up in neon pink, lime green, and black, the retro sandal is back once again‚Äîthough this time you sadly can't wear them to Delia's. 
 Mara Martin explains her decision to bring her daughter onto the catwalk. During the final rounds of a Sports Illustrated open casting call in Miami, Mara Martin hit the runway in a sparkly gold bikini and one very unexpected accessory. While she strutted down the catwalk, she breastfed her five-month-old daughter, Aria. Martin says that her epic walk happened organically‚Äîand somewhat out of necessity. "During the entire casting process for the Sports Illustrated contest, my daughter Aria was with me,‚Äù the Monroe, Michigan-based mom told BAZAAR.com. ‚ÄúThe team and crew got to know her throughout the process and when I found out I made the final 16, the editor of the magazine, MJ Day, asked if I wanted to walk the runway with her for one of my looks."  Show day arrived and Aria was dressed and ready for her debut, but as Martin explained, "nothing goes as planned. The show time kept getting pushed back." Aria started to get hungry backstage. "I began to feed her, like I do every daily, multiple times a day, and did through out the entire casting process. Then casually, MJ came over to me and said that if I wanted to continue feeding when it was my turn, that she would support it." Aria was still feeding when Martin's turn approached. "So I decided to keep feeding her," Martin says. "Breastfeeding is a natural thing and has become such a normal part of my daily life the past five months that I didn‚Äôt really think of anything of it when I decided to walk out."   In a video of Martin walking down the runway, the audience can be heard cheering her on. The model mom even put a pair of little blue headphones on her daughter to protect her ears from the loud music.

She shares her daughter with her fianc√©, Ryan Vandenburg, who is also excited about positive reaction to Martin's catwalk‚Äîalbeit a little surprised. "When my fianc√© and I went home the next day... the phone kept ringing and notifications kept coming in,‚Äù she adds. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so grateful and humbled that so many people around the world have shown support to me and what I did on the runway with Aria. I hope that women in general can keep lifting each other up and become each other‚Äôs biggest fans."  According to her previous posts, Martin is a champion of women's empowerment. The day after walking in the Sports Illustrated contest, she wrote on Instagram: "I‚Äôm so grateful to be able to share this message and hopefully normalize breastfeeding and also show others that women CAN DO IT ALL! But to be honest, the real reason I can‚Äôt believe it is a headline is because it shouldn‚Äôt be a headline!!! My story of being a mother and feeding her while walking is just that." She also captioned a photo of her newborn daughter: "Here‚Äôs to STRONG women. May we KNOW them  May we BE them  May we RAISE them."

 30% of proceeds go towards Physicians for Reproductive Health.  From 'Nasty Woman' t-shirts to accessories supporting Planned Parenthood, the last two years have been filled with a surplus of fashion supporting women's rights.  The latest philanthropic accessory isn't overtly plastered with the word 'Nasty,' nor is it an empty brand gimmick trying to sell you a dose of feminism. Instead, it's a necklace by jewelry designer Sophie Ratner that subtly pays nod to one of the most important Supreme Court decisions of all time: Roe v. Wade.  A collaboration with Physicians for Reproductive Health, Sophie Ratner's '1973' necklace celebrates the 45th anniversary of the 1973 Supreme Court case that granted women the right to an abortion. It's continuing to support the protection of women's reproductive rights today by donating 30% of proceeds from the sale of each necklace to the Physicians for Reproductive Health organization.  Sophie Ratner necklace, $115, sophieratner.com. SHOP NOW The Roe v. Wade-inspired necklace is offered in three variations: silver ($115), gold ($350), and a diamond-encrusted style ($850). "In this time of attacks on evidence-based medicine and a woman‚Äôs right to choose, we cannot remain silent. Please join your allies across the country and proudly wear this necklace to remind people everywhere that we must continue to fight for equality and access for reproductive health here in the United States, and throughout the world," the brand designers wrote on Instagram.  Sophie Ratner necklace, $380, sophieratner.com. SHOP NOW After President Trump announced a gag rule that prohibits medical providers from referring patients to safe, legal abortions, the protection of Roe v. Wade's legacy is more important than ever. Trump's newly-announced Reagan-era policy not only makes it more difficult for women to access contraception and abortion, it also blatantly attacks Planned Parenthood.  While we can't count on a necklace to save the world, Sophie Ratner's charitable 1973 design makes for an empowering way to preserve your sanity and accessorize in solidarity during a period of seemingly endless attacks on women's rights in the United States‚Äîall while supporting the mission of Physicians for Reproductive Health.

 The speaker of the house is a beacon in fuchsia in a sea of blue‚Äîand we're here for it... Nancy Pelosi is our Speaker of the House. She is an accomplished politician. She is a democrat. She is third in line to take power of the free world should the President and Vice President be unable to fulfill their duties for any reason. She can rock a red-orange MaxMara coat and sunglasses with as much swagger as Beyonce on stage or Gigi Hadid on the runway. She may or may not be making hot pink her signature color. None of these statements lessen anything about the others.  A photo with the all new Democratic committee chairmen was released today and in it, our Speaker of the House is bringing her fashion A-game in a hot pink suit, worn not with muted, neutral flats, but coordinating pink pumps. The suit is paired with a simple white tank underneath. Her smile radiates from the image taken in the Capitol's Rayburn Room. The other women in the photo, including liberal favorite and generally awesome human Maxine Waters, looks lovely in the photo as well. There are some very standard navy suits on the male congressmen. But there isn't an article here about their outfits because they are not wearing a hot pink suit. Nancy Pelosi is using fashion to stand out, it's one of the tools in her kit as a (more than) capable, professional female politician.  Pelosi's fashion choices have officially become a "thing." Vanessa Friedman wrote an op-ed in the Times defending her prerogative to cover the style choices of Pelosi after some readers were up in arms about an article on that standout MaxMara coat she wore while leaving the White House to discuss the Mexico border wall. The Washington Post similarly declared that it isn't "sexist" to reference Pelosi's pink suit which she donned when the new 116th Congress was sworn in (including 127 women). If discussing Pelosi-in-pink is wrong we don't want to be right.

As the DJ plays ‚ÄúWalk It Talk It‚Äù by Migos featuring Drake, the 23-year-old model and Harper's BAZAAR cover star recreates her walk from Stuart Weitzman's freshly released campaign video‚Äîcalled #SWWALK‚Äîas dozens of cameras flash in an attempt to capture the perfect Insta-worthy moment.  With the four-part Gordon von Steiner-helmed visual co-starring Willow Smith, Yang Mi, and Jean Campbell on a loop in the background, guests such as Marianna Hewitt, Olivia Culpo, and Chriselle Lim sipped on champagne and were encouraged to recreate or offer up their own interpretation of that strut. Ahead of the campaign's in-person immersive experience, Jenner sat down with BAZAAR.com to discuss the recently launched Stuart Weitzman nude collection, her first big shoe memory, and who is the shoe queen of her family. Harper's BAZAAR: What made you want to be part of the new Stuart Weitzman campaign? Kendall Jenner: I was really excited about it. I always wanted to work with them. And I knew it was a good group of girls, between, Yang [Mi], me, Jean [Campbell], Willow [Smith.]  HB: The Spring-Summer 2019 campaign highlights Stuart Weitzman‚Äôs inclusive shade range of ‚Äúnude shoes.‚Äù Why do you think it‚Äôs important for brands to incorporate diversity into their products and campaigns? KJ: The whole nude thing and keeping simple colors, it's really nice and super elegant and it's perfect because I would say if I was looking at my whole closet of shoes, the most shoes that I have are the pretty simple ones because you can wear them over and over and over again. They never get old, the trend never goes. The nudes collection is really cool.    HB: Which is your favorite shoe from the new collection and why? KJ: The pump [she is wearing the Anny 70 pump in cappuccino brown patent leather] just because it's so simple, like I was saying before it's so simple I could wear it maybe 700 times over and not get judged for it. I love this one and I like this color. HB: Who is the "Shoe Queen" in your family? KJ: Khloe has a lot, and I always looked up to her collection. I don't know if it's a selfish reason because she's my shoe size so maybe that's why, all my other sisters have small feet. Kylie has a really good collection. I'd say Kylie and Khloe.  
 HB: Tell us about your first big shoe memory? KJ: Kylie and I used to wear my mom's shoes all the time, and even Kourtney's shoes, 'cause Kourtney is like a [size] 4.5, her foot is really small. When I was maybe ten-years-old, I would fit [in] her shoes, so, Kylie and I would steal Kourtney's shoes all the time and do little runway competitions  and we would steal my moms, but they were a bit bigger.  HB: If you could only wear one shoe for the rest of your life, which pair would you select?  KJ: I'd probably pick a good boot. Maybe a mid-rise heel, nothing too high or too low. Something you can walk really nice in and that's really comfortable. Just sleek and simple.   HB: You haven‚Äôt walked in a NYFW show for the past couple of seasons. Do you have any plans to walk any shows while you‚Äôre here?  KJ: Uhh, nope, not here in New York. KB: What about the other fashion capitals?  KJ: For Europe? I think so. HB: Valentine‚Äôs Day is only two days away! What songs would be on your Valentine‚Äôs Day playlist?  KJ: Ooh, thats a good question. So I have an Apple Music radio show, with one of my friends, we call it ZaZa World, and you'll have to listen to it because we have a whole playlist for Valentine's day, so check it out.  HB: Do you have any plans for V-Day?  KJ: Just here, hanging out in New York.   HB: Outside of modeling, you and Kylie launched your namesake ready-to-wear line. What other creative mediums are you drawn to and would like to experience next?  KJ: That's a good question. I'm really into a lot of things, and I have fun with the whole creative process, whether it be beauty or fashion or whatever, so I'm sure there are things in the future. HB: Beyond major editorials and covers, you‚Äôve scored some bluechip fashion and beauty campaigns. Who is a creative in the fashion or beauty industry that you haven‚Äôt worked with yet, but love the chance to collaborate with?  KJ: I've always really loved Steven Meisel as a photographer. There's so many, but yeah, thats my one for now. HB: Your career comes with a lot of traveling, so if the TSA confiscated your cosmetic bag, which three beauty products would you miss the most? KJ: My bronzer, cause you always gotta have a glow, gotta look nice. Chapstick, because I hate being dry on a plane, and mascara, or a good concealer. I'll go concealer.  HB: Which kind of bronzer do you use? KJ: A  little Chanel palette it's the creamy one, on top of that I use an Estee Lauder bronze goddess powder.  HB: What's the best beauty tip you've learned on-set? KJ: On-set if you can get away with a little bit of contour like I was just saying, that helps with making you look healthier, and brighter. Just drink a lot of water. HB: I like your [snake hoop] earrings. Do you know what brand they are? KJ: No, my stylist brought out a big tray of jewelry, and I was like I like these and these.  HB: Your stylist is Marni [Senofonte], right? HB: Yeah, Marni. HB: How do you guys like to collaborate together?  KJ: It's super collaborative; she pulls a bunch of stuff, and we get together, and I pick all of the stuff I really like, and we'll throw things together, and it's really. If I could say 50-50 it's pretty, it's very collaborative.  
 Deauville gave Coco Chanel her first limelight, readying her to catapult fashion into another century.  Deauville, a lavish seaside resort in the south of France, was the place to be in 1913. The  epicenter of fashion, trends, and high society at the turn of the 20th century, enters 29-year-old Gabrielle (Coco) Chanel.  From the window of the finest suite at the Hotel Normandy Deauville, the budding creative visionary was moved by the spirit of the idyllic beach countryside. She drew inspiration from everything around her: the practicality of mens' boating jackets, the ease of nautical sailor stripes, the color of Normandy's impressionist skies, and the dreamy way fabric whipped to life under a gust of the ocean breeze. The city spurred Chanel's sartorial dream, one unrestrained by uncomfortable, narrow, corset dresses with heavy trains, which typified women's style of the era. Many of those influences recently resurfaced at the brand's Resort collection, complete with a life sized Chanel cruise ship. Both rebellious and unconventional, the French fashion trend-setter anticipated the coming of a new era for women. Cutting her hair, romping through the caf√© terraces, Coco Chanel wanted all women to adopt a new stance on style. She envisioned the ease of women's clothing stitched with jersey, inspired by the polo players at the french racetracks. She yearned for swimsuits that allowed the sun to kiss the skin, fluid fabrics, and wide-legged trousers, both simple and stylish. It was beside the French seaside that the style icon established her sartorial signature, which lives on in the label today.  Below, the new episode of Inside Chanel. In chapter 22, the homage to the famed designer highlights the beautiful love story between Chanel and Deauville, pivotal in catapulting fashion into another century. 
 Old-World Meets Avant Garde‚Äìat the Hotel de Crillon. In today‚Äôs style vernacular, words like heritage, heirloom, tradition and history are rarely considered. After all, fashion is about consistently thinking forward‚Äînever backward‚Äîonly referring to seasons and collections past as a way of acknowledging a current it-item or trend's place in the industry‚Äôs ever-changing dialogue.  This is where Couture, the intersection of the old guard and fashion‚Äôs future, finds itself at a crossroads. With ready-to-wear brands slowly finding their place on the Couture fashion calendar (we see you Rodarte and Proenza Schouler), and in a time where true craftsmanship is few and far between, we are consistently at a loss for what to revere in fashion‚Äôs ever-changing, over-saturated landscape. Haute Couture, at its purest, bridges the gap; here, fresh ideas and modernity, translated by traditional handwork and age-old techniques‚Äìrise to the surface. Historic hotels find themselves at a similar junction. Their strong-hold on tradition, commitment to finery and elite service seems out of place in a world packed with the up-and-coming. Hotels with history, pomp and circumstance seem to struggle to find their place in the laid-back luxury sphere while also managing to find a way to remain relevant. Enter the Hotel de Crillon, A Rosewood Hotel, which, after a four-year, multi-hundred-million dollar renovation, is looking better than ever with suites re-designed Haute Couturier Karl Lagerfeld. Attempting to offer guests an informal-meets-formal hotel experience, where convenience and elegance‚Äîrather than over-the-top grandeur‚Äîwin the day, the hotel, which re-opened on the heels of Fall 2017 Haute Couture this past July, is an interesting foil for the state of current couture‚Äîand an apropos location in which to highlight the season's best looks.  The Hotel de Crillon, it seems, is Paris's new Garden of Eden, and BAZAAR.com was in Paris for its re-opening to select the Couture collections's best looks and position them in the hotel's most exclusive enclaves. The Eve to our Eden? Georgia Fowler, whose high-fashion meets Victoria's Secret resume personifies that marriage of inspiration and accessibility that the current state of Couture‚Äîand the newly revived Crillon‚Äîseem to capture so seamlessly.

 After analyzing customer returns, a size 15 jean has been born.  Good American, the denim brand launched in 2016 by Khloe Kardashian and Emma Grede, was built on size inclusivity. And although it's carried a size 00 to 24 jeans since its inception, the brand has discovered a customer it was overlooking inbetween.  After analyzing customer data, Good American found it received 50 percent more returns of size 14 and 16 jeans than any other size in its range. "My design team and I believe that the reason for this is that between size 14 and 16 we switch from using a 'straight' pattern to a 'plus' pattern. In the plus pattern, allowances are made for a totally different body type, which you might not necessarily need if you‚Äôre at the higher end of the straight sizes or the lower end of plus," Emma Grede, co-founder of Good American, told BAZAAR.com over email.  So to combat the issue, they invented a new size jean: 15. Launching today, the size 15 jeans will be available as part of Good American's new 'Good Curve' collection in a variety of styles including straight and flare cuts. The price points range from $159 - $169.    During a time when many brands are trying to profit off the body positive movement without putting in the work (or even offering plus sizes), Good American's hands-on approach to customer feedback shows it's serious about putting its money where its mouth is.  "A large part of our success comes from listening to our customers and directly applying their feedback. Our new fit and size have been in the works for nearly a year after reviewing our customer data and size patterns. From there, we used social media to find a focus group of women who fell between sizes 14 and 16 and brought them into our office. We measured their bodies, listened to their concerns and needs, and understood what they were looking for when it comes to denim in order to perfect the new size," Grede said.  The fashion industry still has a lot of work to do when it comes to size inclusivity and it could stand to learn a thing or two from Good American's strategy.

 The actress launched her first fashion parternship surrounded by women who inspire her.  Mandy Moore has gone seamlessly from teenage pop star to rom-com queen to This Is Us actress and now, she's dipping her toes in the fashion world. As Fossil's newest ambassador, Moore stars in the brand's Fall campaign, which features her watch designs and marks her first partnership in the fashion space.  To launch the collaboration, the This Is Us star hosted a dinner celebrating women and the power of female friendship on Saturday night. Nestled in the hills of Malibu, the evening unfolded at One Gun Ranch‚Äîa sustainable women-led farm co-owned by Alice Bamford and Anne Eysenring‚Äîcomplete with horses, roaming dogs and pigs, and incredible sunset views of Malibu.   Moore translated the campaign's concept of authenticity and inspiring women into a dinner of the ladies who inspire her most‚Äîincluding This Is Us co-star Chrissy Metz and influencers like Emily Schuman, Marianna Hewitt, Jacey Duprie, and Katherine Schwarzenegger.  At the dinner, Moore (dressed in a stunning red Rosie Assoulin cape dress) explained to BAZAAR.com how important these relationships have been throughout her career, ‚ÄúA lot of the women who inspire me are at the dinner here tonight. I feel really lucky that I have a lot of powerful, self-assured, and confident ladies in my life that I get to lean on‚Äîpeople that I work with and friends. I feel like I have this constant force of inspiration in that sense and people to look up to and feel comfortable to be myself in front of. Those are the women that have the biggest impact on me on a daily basis."   Along with the women in her life, Moore also looked to her home renovations and Pinterest for inspiration for her first design collab. ‚ÄúThe partnership came about when I was at the tail-end of the design process of my home, so I was immersed in fixtures and materials and stuff that I was inspired by while redoing my house. I sent a lot of Pinterest-y tear sheets that I sent to the designer working on my house [to Fossil] and they took it and made it into watch form." The end result was her watch face design for Fossil's new Q Venture HR smartwatch, "I took my obsession and my affinity for terrazzo, geometric patterns, and brass inlay and put it towards the dial designs of the watch. There‚Äôs not enough terrazzo in our lives these days!"  Despite this being her first design partnership, it's hardly Moore's foray into the fashion world. Working with stylist Cristina Ehrlich, the actress has become a force on the red carpet in show-stopping looks by brands like Rodarte and Johanna Ortiz, and notes she's come a long way from her early-aughts style choices. "I think every day is another opportunity to use fashion as self-expression and not pigeonhole yourself, having fun and the freedom to try new things and just feel empowered in that way," she explained. "Every day is another opportunity to use fashion as self-expression and not pigeonhole yourself." While some teenage pop stars may have had trouble navigating their careers as they got older, Moore has impressively managed a diverse lineup of projects over the years‚Äîall of which feel authentic to her persona. The secret? It's all about sticking to her gut. ‚ÄúI think it always falls back on the gut check‚Äîif there‚Äôs any doubt, don‚Äôt do it. Something has to feel good across the board, it has to be representative of me, to make me empowered. Anything that feels disingenuous is going to come across as such, I‚Äôm a terrible liar. In a work sense, it‚Äôs about finding projects that challenge me and shift my perspective, but something I feel I could add value to." 
 The model opens up about her experience with the illness. Gigi Hadid responded to critics of her weight in a series of tweets on Sunday night. The model, who is suffering from a thyroid condition called Hashimoto's Disease, explained that her changing body type was a result of the illness.  "For those of you so determined to come up w why my body has changed over the years, you may not know that when I started @ 17 I was not yet diagnosed w/Hashimoto‚Äôs disease; those of u who called me 'too big for the industry' were seeing inflammation & water retention due to that," she said in her first tweet.  Hashimoto's disease is a disorder where your immune system attacks your thyroid, leading to chronic inflammation, according to the American Thyroid Association. Over time, it results in the thyroid's inability to produce ample hormones and, eventually, leads to an underactive thyroid. There are no specific symptoms unique to the illness, according to the ATA, but some signs include swelling at the front of the throat, a puffy face, and unexpected weight gain, according to Mayo Clinic.  "Over the last few years I‚Äôve been properly medicated to help symptoms including those, as well as extreme fatigue, metabolism issues, body‚Äôs ability to retain heat, etc," Hadid continued. "I was also part of a holistic medical trial that helped my thyroid levels balance out." The 22-year-old added, "Although stress & excessive travel can also affect the body, I have always eaten the same, my body just handles it differently now that my health is better. I may be ‚Äútoo skinny‚Äù for u, honestly this skinny isn‚Äôt what I want to be, but I feel healthier internally and am still learning and growing with my body everyday, as everyone is." Gigi ended on a powerful note, stating she would no longer "explain the way my body looks" to her critics and clarified that "drugs are not my thing." I will not further explain the way my body looks, just as anyone, with a  body type that doesnt suit ur ‚Äúbeauty‚Äù expectation, shouldnt have to. Not to judge others, but drugs are not my thing, stop putting me in that box just because u dont understand the way my body has matured. And she urged her fellow social media users to "learn to have more empathy for others." Please, as social media users & human beings in general, learn to have more empathy for others and know that you never really know the whole story. Use your energy to lift those that you admire rather than be cruel to those u don‚Äôt. Hadid previously opened up about her diagnosis in December 2016. "My metabolism actually changed like crazy this year. I have Hashimoto's disease. It's a thyroid disease, and it's now been two years since taking the medication for it," she said at the time.  Because of her changing body, Hadid actually aimed to build muscle rather than shed weight while training for the 2016 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show. "I just want to have muscles in the right place," she said, "And if my butt can get a little perkier, then that's good."

 This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. No matter where you are in the world, a wave hello (or goodbye) is something that's universally recognized in every culture. Whether you‚Äôre waving excitedly to a friend in your hometown or greeting a barista in Milan, it‚Äôs a small gesture that conveys a ton of meaning.  Above, Marianna Hewitt, one of BAZAAR‚Äôs most stylish friends and the founder behind the beauty brands Summer Fridays, demonstrates six different ways to wave. 
 As if the VS runway couldn't get any sexier... Balmain is designing custom looks for this year's Victoria's Secret Fashion Show in Shanghai, and the models won't be the only ones wearing the collab. A #VSxBalmain collection will also be available to shop in-store and online on November 29, the day after the show's broadcast.   The lingerie brand announced the major collaboration today on Instagram and posted a graphic on its website. This is apparently the first time VS has ever teamed up with a high fashion brand for a range to sell through retail. Balmain's creative director Olivier Rousteing doesn't stray far from VS. He's previously attended the brand's over-the-top presentations, and is apt to cast its models for his own runway shows. Just last week, VS Angels like Alessandra Ambrosio, Josephine Skriver, and Elsa Hosk walked in his Spring 2018 presentation during Paris Fashion Week.  We can't wait to see what he has in store for Shanghai. Considering Rousteing's signature steamy designs for Balmain‚Äî√† la bodycon silhouettes, cage cut-outs, shimmery fabrics, and luxe embellishments‚Äîexpect the VS runway to get a few degrees hotter this year.

 Today we lost a legend of literary and sartorial greatness... He gave us a new style of writing called "New Journalism," he gave us "The Electric Kool-aid Acid Test," "Bonfire of the Vanities," and "The Right Stuff." Women of my generation saw themselves or their peers too clearly in "I Am Charlotte Simmons." He wore many different hats when he delved deeply into his varied subject matter‚Äîbut in every day life he almost always wore the very same thing‚Äîa crisp white suit. Fashion and literary lovers alike have to tip their hats to Tom Wolfe, a man who gave the world many literary gifts and always looked great doing so.

 Fendi paid tribute to its late creative director with a touching video.  After 54 years as creative director, Karl Lagerfeld's final collection for Fendi hit the runway today at Milan Fashion Week, just two days after his death. An emotional occasion, the Italian fashion house paid tribute to its late creative director in a series of touching ways throughout the show.  Upon arrival, every seat was topped with a moving tribute card commemorating the designer's death and show notes came with sketches of Lagerfeld's final collection.  Closing out the Fendi runway for the first time was Gigi Hadid, who frequently worked with Lagerfeld over the last few years. The model, who appeared to be in tears, wore a sheer, bright yellow dress down the runway.  Making for an emotional finale walk, many models held back tears as David Bowie's "Heroes" played.  ‚ÄúThe bond between Karl Lagerfeld and Fendi is fashion‚Äôs longest love story ‚ù§Ô∏è....He shall be so missed.‚Äù- Silvia Venturini Fendi, Karl‚Äôs collaborator since 1965. Here his final collection for @fendi #karllagerfeld  #Regram Fashion Director @nicolefritton A post shared by  Harper's BAZAAR (@harpersbazaarus) on Feb 21, 2019 at 4:36am PST For his last Fendi collection, Lagerfeld sent a range of tailored suiting, feminine dresses, and laser-cut leather pieces down the Fall 2019 runway. Unexpected pops of color came in the form of buttery leather pieces, sheer dresses, and a new range of the brand's nostalgic baguette bags.    Following an emotional standing ovation, the fashion house played a tribute video to its creative director of 54 years. The video features Lagerfeld being asked to sketch what he looked like on his first day at Fendi in 1965, five decades earlier. The designer, wearing his signature leather gloves, sketches himself while looking back fondly on the time.    A heartfelt tribute to Karl Lagerfeld, Fendi's Woman‚Äôs Ready to wear and Couture designer for over five decades. Karl, you will be dearly missed. A post shared by  Fendi (@fendi) on Feb 21, 2019 at 4:14am PST  "A heartfelt tribute to Karl Lagerfeld, Fendi's Ready to wear and Couture designer for over five decades.

 The insider‚Äôs guide to choosing the right pair of frames. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. Eyewear has always been the fashion accessory par excellence, conveying the strong and decisively stylish personality of their wearer. They allow you to observe without being observed, so it‚Äôs no coincidence that they‚Äôre a signature of fashion show front rows. Magazine editors, reporters, influencers, socialites, celebrities, buyers‚Äîthe front-row attendees who style the rest of the world, intentionally or not‚Äîall agree that shades are essential for every show. Max Mara Eyewear and its latest sunglasses and eyeglasses for the autumn/winter 2019-2020 season are inspired by these faces lining the sides of the runways. The collection includes cat-eye and oversized silhouettes with luxe touches like all-over crocodile texture and precious-metal detailing, with color palettes that makes a strong visual impact against the flash of a camera. You‚Äôre about to see these glamorous shades in the front row, on Instagram, and everywhere else. But which fashion-show personality is most like your own? Take inspiration from this eyewear guide to find the style that‚Äôs right for you. The editor-in-chief wields influence not just over the pages of her magazine, but across the landscape of capital-F Fashion as a whole‚Äîand she never leaves her shades behind. From the front row, a pair of big black sunglasses shields her expressions from the flashes of photographers who are more often trying to capture a glimpse of her reaction to the latest collection, rather than the runway itself.  The most fashionable Max Mara sunglasses to own to recreate the look are oversized and made of Optyl plastic; they turn yellow to highlight a personality that is as strong as it is (fashionably) unusual. Strike high-style dissonance by combining them with mustard and turquoise coats from the Max Mara 2019 fall-winter collection. The pen is mightier than the sword, but is the power of her style even greater? A fashion journalist slices through the cacophony of each hectic season with both her judgment on the latest collections‚Äîwhich designers look forward to with equal parts anticipation and dread‚Äîand her personal interpretations on how to wear fashion‚Äôs latest signature pieces.  From the front row, the runway reporter can take a cue from her boss in a pair of hyper-feminine shades like these from the Max Mara Eyewear 2019 collection, made for the well-dressed working woman who‚Äôs in all black from morning to night. The metal Prism detail on the side rod (covered here in a luxe faux crocodile) is an iconic symbol of the Max Mara eyewear brand that blends seamlessly into this cat-eye style. Influencers in one form or another have sat front row for years at even the most coveted haute couture runways. But the rise of social media means that the whole world, not just the fashion world, pays attention when they post one perfectly styled photo after another, like from the front row in a statement pair of fashionable shades.  The sunglasses of a real influencer provide a pop of color, often have gradient lenses, and are either maxi or mini‚Äîthere is no in-between. This eyewear especially exudes confidence when paired with a patchwork outfit from Max Mara 2019: a swirl of tweed, check, crocodile, and zebra that mix and match print and texture with outstanding results. These fashion icons who attend the coolest and most exclusive events in every major city are the real soul of the front row. They have breakfast in New York and dinner in Milan, and not just during Fashion Week. And whether they‚Äôre in sunglasses or eyeglasses, they know that eyewear is not just a simple style accessory, but  rather an integral way to communicate their personality.  Socialites are most likely to combine Max Mara Eyewear 2019 fall-winter glasses with very long coats and even longer dresses, which Max Mara handily has on deck for next season. ‚ÄúLess is more‚Äù? The top of the social crop certainly don‚Äôt think so. Celebrities live their lives with sunglasses on to protect them from the prying eyes of fans and the reckless lenses of paparazzi cameras. But their eyewear functions as both a necessity and a symbol of style, no more so than when worn to an important designer‚Äôs show. The look? Simply black and oversized, period. It‚Äôs the camouflage that will get you noticed. Real fashion insiders know that the doors of a show do not close until all of the buyers on the list are in. They‚Äôve earned their front-row membership because they‚Äôre the ones who understand what everyone else in the room will want to wear next season, and they pluck those looks straight from the runway.  The businesswoman on the job chooses an outfit of practical elegance to quickly move her from one event to the next, like Max Mara‚Äôs latest camel coat: a passe-partout, totally versatile, and never out of style. The buyer pairs it with Max Mara‚Äôs glamorous crocodile-textured Optyl sunglasses with either gray or brown lenses. Think the business of style is your thing? It could be with the right eyewear. Behind the glamorous frames and dark lenses of sunglasses are the people we love and the people we‚Äôd love to be, which is why the stylish accessory will never cease to fascinate both the fashion crowd and those enamored with it. So have you found your front-row ringer yet? Make the investment in the right eyewear, because good shades aren‚Äôt going anywhere ‚Äî unlike you on the runway of life.
 Which models gained the most followers from the runway? Now that the Spring 2018 collections have officially come to an end, it's time to look back at the shows and models that ruled Fashion Month. Instagram unveiled its seasonal report to recap the most buzzed-about highlights from the runways in New York, London, Milan, and Paris. Tripling the engagement from last season's Fall 2017 shows, this season racked up a total of 709 million likes, comments, stories, and posts from a whopping 143 million Instagram users.    Taking a look at the models who ruled the catwalk, Instagram rounded up the 10 who gained the highest percentage of followers during the month from New York to Paris. Topping the list was transgender model Teddy Quinlivan, who walked countless runways including Marc Jacobs, Versace, Dior, Louis Vuitton, and more. Also rounding out the top five were Carla Bruni and Helena Christensen, two of the '90s supers who walked the Versace show, and Kaia Gerber‚Äîthe 16-year-old runway breakout of the season (and daughter of Cindy Crawford).   The Top 10 Models Who Gained The Most Followers: As for the most popular runways of each city, there were some surprises (Topshop took the number one spot for London) and some that were not so surprising (Saint Laurent's Eiffel Tower show reigned as most popular Insta moment in Paris). See which shows garnered the most Instagram this season below: The Top 5 New York Fashion Week Shows: The Top 5 London Fashion Week Shows: The Top 5 Milan Fashion Week Shows: The Top 5 Paris Fashion Week Shows:   
 Here's the story behind the extremely rare originals.  Versace‚Äôs head sneaker designer Salehe Bembury posted a photo on Instagram Wednesday of a chunky white sneaker with a rainbow logo. Next to the ‚ÄúVersace‚Äù inscription, the graphic looks reminiscent of the original, iconic Apple emblem. The shot was simply captioned: ‚ÄúA wise man once said nothing at all.‚Äù  Sneaker blogs immediately noted the shoe‚Äôs similarity to the extremely rare Apple sneakers, believed to have been made for the computer company's employees in the late 1980s or early 1990s.  It‚Äôs unclear whether Versace will be creating the shoes for purchase, or if the photo was of a single prototype. Bembury declined to elaborate on his post, while Versace didn‚Äôt respond to Esquire‚Äôs requests for comment. Apple had no comment. But the mere idea of an Apple sneaker comeback had fashion followers and sneakerheads buzzing, with the photo racking up thousands of likes and comments.  The original Apple sneakers are shrouded in mystery. Two years ago, a size 9.5 pair were found at a garage sale in Palo Alto, California, just outside Apple‚Äôs Silicon Valley home. The shoes were brought to Heritage Auction, which listed them at a starting bid of $30,000.    ‚ÄúWe believe they were a pair of prototype sneakers made for Apple in the late 1980s or early ‚Äô90s,‚Äù says Hertiage Auction‚Äôs Director of Modern and Contemporary Art Leon Benrimon. ‚ÄúWe believe there were only two pairs made, and the other pair was from the Apple archives. The pair we have are what we believe is the only known private pair.‚Äù  Though the company‚Äôs co-founder Steve Jobs was a loyal New Balance wearer for most of his life, the Apple sneakers resemble Reeboks, with an embroidered Apple logo on the tongue and the side. The bottom is made with non-skid rubber. They look like the mother of all dad sneakers.  When Heritage Auctions first announced they had the originals, the news was covered around the world. Benrimon said the auction house had a number of respectable offers but that the client is holding out for their asking price or higher. They shoes are still listed as available on the auction house‚Äôs site.  Shoes weren‚Äôt Apple‚Äôs only foray into fashion in the '90s. An archived PDF of the 1986 Apple Collection catalogue shows belts, T-shirts, vests, hats, sweaters, and even paperclips and sailboard. "Last year, 22,000 people bought Apple shirts from The Apple Collection‚Äîpeople who like the way we make Apple computers," it reads. "We put our logo on these products because we appreciate their quality, and think you will, too. They come from such outstanding companies as Tiffany, Braun, Bree, ixi:z, Lamy, Mistral, Honda, and others you might not be familiar with." There are no shoes in that catalogue, perhaps indicating they were never widely available, as Benrimon believes. Today, eBay is full of vintage Apple merch, like a sweatshirt listed for $255.  If Versace does produce Apple-inspired shoes, it won‚Äôt be Bembury‚Äôs first time creating a pop culture moment. The New York City-born designer worked with Kanye West at Yeezy before joining the Italian fashion house last year. His first Versace creation was the avant-garde Chain Reaction, a collaboration with rapper 2 Chainz.  Earlier this year Bembury told Hypebeast: ‚ÄúDonatella has given me the green light to create, so that is what I plan to do.‚Äù

 BAZAAR's Editor-in-Chief remembers the late designer.  The world is a less beautiful place today. Karl Lagerfeld was a visionary right until the end. His mastery‚Äîof fabric, design, silhouette, and the very process of creative reinvention‚Äîwas a breathtaking thing to behold. His creations were so exquisite, I have been known to shed a tear. "His mastery‚Äîof fabric, design, silhouette, and the very process of creative reinvention‚Äîwas a breathtaking thing to behold." I first met Karl in 1988, when I became editor in chief of Marie Claire in the U.K. Over the years, he has given me some of my greatest fashion memories. Each season I would visit him in Paris at his atelier for a preview of the Chanel collection before the show. When I arrived at my hotel room, there would be a small rain forest waiting for me with a handwritten note from Karl saying how much he was looking forward to our meetings. The arrangements were different each time, but one thing was consistent: their size. They were so big, it would often take six people to get them through the door.  Karl was extremely kind and generous. I will always treasure the many drawings he did of me and the thoughtful notes he sent, explaining in detail what he particularly liked about Bazaar. He would do the same with other designers. He would write to them and send flowers before their shows.    I always looked forward to seeing Karl in Paris. I remember one time, we broke into a spontaneous cha-cha during one of the fittings, and the whole atelier stopped and started to applaud. Another one of my favorite memories was when Karl threw a ball for Stephen Gan and me at his private home in Paris. We danced until the early hours of the morning!  In those early days, I would have dinner in Paris with Karl, just the two of us. I would turn up in a dress‚Äîit didn‚Äôt matter whose dress it was‚Äîand he would tell me the origin of the design. He would say, ‚ÄúI know where that inspiration came from.‚Äù And then he would explain that it was based on an original design from Madame Gr√®s or Vionnet or Schiaparelli. He had an encyclopedic knowledge of fashion and a deeper well of aesthetic references than anyone I‚Äôve ever met.    Over the years, Karl participated in dozens of stories for Harper‚Äôs Bazaar. I once got Karl to do an imaginary conversation with Chanel. He loved it so much, he asked French actress Jeanne Moreau to do the voice over as Coco Chanel. And the tape was sold at Le Bon March√©! We featured Karl with Choupette‚Äôs ears; he also dressed up as a rapper and then later as a vampire. When we convinced Takashi Murakami, who had never done portraiture before, to create a portfolio of designers, Karl gamely posed, ultimately purchasing the image from the artist and hanging it in the Chanel offices. Later, when Murakami did his exhibit ‚ÄúThe Octopus Eats Its Own Leg,‚Äù Karl not only posed alongside the creature, but took the picture himself. At the time, he said he identified with the octopus. If I ever asked designers to do some outlandish idea, they would all agree to do it if Karl participated in the piece. From star signs to aesthetic opposites, no conceit was too out there if Karl was on board.     Karl also had a wicked sense of humor. In 2008, when I received my Order of the British Empire from Queen Elizabeth, Karl told me he wanted to design a couture Chanel suit for me and asked what color the medal was. I told him it was pink. I arrived in Britain and opened up the garment bag, expecting to see pink and instead there was a navy blue suit. So I wrote him a note and said, ‚ÄúOh, well, navy blue is the pink of England.‚Äù And we cried laughing!    As fastidious as Karl was about many things, punctuality was not one of them. He was notorious for being late. Whether I was visiting him at his home or meeting him for drinks at Caf√© Flore, I would always go with a big book and expect to wait two hours for his arrival. He also hated people remembering his birthday. The only gift I ever gave him which I think he liked was a pair of custom-made Chrome Hearts ‚ÄúKL‚Äù cuff links. Everyone from his atelier called me to say what a success they had been.   "From star signs to aesthetic opposites, no conceit was too out there if Karl was on board." I first knew Karl was ill when I visited him at his atelier and he didn‚Äôt walk me out to the elevator. That‚Äôs when I realized something was wrong. Because he always escorted me out. The last time I saw him, we were talking about our next collaboration! He was excited. ‚ÄúThat is the best idea I‚Äôve ever heard!‚Äù he said without hesitation. And I thought to myself, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs high praise indeed, coming from the master.‚Äù There will never be another Karl. He will live on in our hearts‚Äîand the pages of Bazaar‚Äîforever.
 "How dope would it have been to see some curves on the runway?" If, like Jim Carrey, you thought New York Fashion Week was "meaningless," you might want to rethink your opinion. From Nicki Minaj calling out designers for appropriating black culture and then not including black models in their shows, to Ashley Graham's lingerie show, which proved to be a true celebration of diversity, this season has prompted some important discussions. And now, Ashley has called out Rihanna for her her lack of curvy representation in her Fenty x Puma show.  Speaking to Yahoo Style, Ashley had a few comments to make after attending the Fenty show: "I was at Fenty last night, and that was an amazing show. But how dope would it have been to see some curves on the runway?"  FENTY FENTY FENTY A post shared by  A S H L E Y  G R A H A M (@ashleygraham) on Sep 12, 2017 at 3:27pm PDT Graham also said she's saddened that after last season's strong showing of plus-size models, the momentum has since cooled on the spring runways.

 Can you tell they're not real people? Balmain has introduced a new gang of supermodels‚Äîbut, they're not real. This season, creative director Olivier Rousteing has opted for a "virtual army" of digitally manufactured models to wear his newest collection. "Anyone and everyone is always welcome to join Balmain army's growing ranks ‚Äî they need only share our bold spirit of adventure as our new virtual icons, Margot, Shudu and Zhi who mirror the beauty, the rock style and the confident power," says  Balmain's official website. The lifelike models were created by photographer Cameron-James Wilson, who famously created Shudu in 2017.  The clothing is "styled" by CLO Virtual Fashion, which creates hyperrealistic, 3D garment simulations.  Shudu is known as the "world's first digital super model." Her Instagram page has almost 140,000 followers, and she's already been featured in campaigns for Fenty Beauty and editorial shoots for Women's Wear Daily and Cosmopolitan.  The popularity of virtual models is definitely on the rise. Lil Miquela, a character created by Trevor McFedries and Sara Decou as a digital art project, has over 1 million followers on Instagram and models high fashion looks, along with promoting multiple charitable organizations to help bring awareness to their causes.  Balmain's Rousteing is known for his edgy style and focus on bringing the French fashion house to the forefront of the digital age.  "We need to change. We need to push boundaries. We need to talk to the new generation. We need to make fashion relevant," he said in a video for the New York Times last year. Earlier this year, Rousteing created "My City of Lights," which is a virtual reality experience and headset to help people understand his creative process. In a promo video for Balmain, he says he wanted to help "bridge the gap between fashion and technology."

 The new exhibition is a reminder that fashion is best when it doesn't take itself too seriously. A lot of people are still confused about what "camp," the theme of this year's Met Gala, actually means. But as soon as you set foot in the Metropolitan Museum of Art's new costume exhibit, all becomes clear: Camp has nothing to do with tie-dying t-shirts at summer camp. It has everything to do with basking in the fabulousness, irony, and humor of being extra. From Balenciaga's towering platform Crocs to Bj√∂rk's infamous swan dress and the Mugler oyster shell gown Cardi B wore to the Grammys, the "Camp: Notes on Fashion" exhibit is an exploration of how over-the-top fashion (or more accurately, FASHUN) has been used as both a form of expression and escapism throughout history. The concept was inspired by Susan Sontag's 1964 essay that defines camp as "love of the unnatural: of artifice and exaggeration." Though Sontag took camp mainstream, the aesthetic originally stems from queer culture and dates back to the 17th century. Still, the art of camp remains hard to define to this day.  But in our current divisive political landscape filled with polarizing Internet opinions and a never-ending news cycle, camp is more timelier now than ever. "We're experiencing a resurgence of camp not only in fashion, but in culture in general, " Andrew Bolton, curator of The Costume Exhibit said at the exhibition's preview this morning. "Camp tends to come during times of cultural instability."  Why is that, exactly? Well, what better way to process times of chaos and instability than through extreme fashion that serves as a fun form of escapism? It can be theatrical, it can be ironic, it can even be humorous, but no matter what, camp is a crucial way of capturing and expressing the zeitgeist of any time period in culture.   Camp has arrived! üéâüéâ Tonight we host the 2019 Costume Institute Benefit celebrating ‚ÄúCamp: Notes on Fashion,‚Äù open to the public this Thursday, May 9. üëÜWatch our IG Story for a sneak peek inside the exhibition and join us here later for live coverage of The Met Gala red carpet, starting at 6pm EDT. #MetCamp #MetGala A post shared by  The Met (@metmuseum) on May 6, 2019 at 8:37am PDT In an age of toxic masculinity in Trump's America, it's now more important than ever to hold onto and highlight camp's original roots: the LGBTQ community.  The first part of the exhibit looks back to queer subcultures of Europe and America that largely defined and explored homosexuality through camp in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. There are portraits of nude male bodies by photographers like Robert Mapplethorpe and Thomas Eakins, as well as a statue of the Greek God Antinous, Hadrian‚Äôs lover, which Bolton refers to as the ‚Äúarchetypical camp pose.‚Äù Today's camp movement can be largely defined by drag culture.  ‚ÄúCamp: Notes on Fashion‚Äù explores the origins of camp‚Äôs exuberant aesthetic and how the sensibility evolved from a place of marginality to become an important influence on mainstream culture. #MetCamp pic.twitter.com/hoiLo9Djv4 While the first half of the exhibit highlights the early, less obvious stages of camp, the second half is an ode to "deliberate camp," which is the more in-your-face side of camp. Think Viktor & Rolf's meme-able couture gowns that read "Less Is More" and "Sorry I'm Late I Didn't Want to Come." Think Moschino sending Gigi Hadid and Kaia Gerber down the runway dressed as human-sized floral bouquets. Think wearing a giant feathered swan on your head instead of a baseball cap.    To put it most simply, it's basically just a room full of the most FASHUN pieces from the last few decades that none of your relatives on Facebook would ever understand‚Äîand that's the most fun part of it all.      Camp is just another word for FASHUN, HUNNY‚ÄºÔ∏è When I have kids, this is how I‚Äôm going to dress to pick them up from school. Enjoy these crooked/blurry sneak peaks at the Met‚Äôs new Costume Exhibit before tonight‚Äôs #metgala lewks... A post shared by  Lauren Alexis Fisher (@laurenalexisnyc) on May 6, 2019 at 8:57am PDT  Still confused about camp? Don't feel bad, Bolton himself says the term is "nearly impossible to define or summarize." Perhaps that's the point of it all. Either way, the exhibit is a reminder that fashion is at its most fun when it's not taking itself too seriously.   The Met's Camp: Notes on Fashion exhibition opens to the public on Thursday, May 9.    
 She wore the accessory straight off Brandon Maxwell's Spring 2019 runway.  From the runway to the street style scene, New York Fashion Week is gracing us with plenty of looks worth trying next season. But last night, Gigi Hadid one-upped them all with a real LEWK worn straight off the Brandon Maxwell runway. While attending the #BoF500 dinner, the model stepped out in a striking yellow dress from the designer's Spring 2019 collection, which showed on Saturday. And although the dress itself was stunning, it was her handbag that was the real stuff of legends. The clear t0p-handle box bag held nothing but a bottle of sparkling ros√©‚Äîbecause, really, what more does one need to carry?   How truly embarrassing for all the people who thought handbags were invented to carry around trivial necessities like your wallet, lipstick, and keys? This is so obviously the sole purpose of a woman's purse, people.  Throughout the night, the iconic ros√©-filled bag made it into Gigi's many group photo ops with the likes of her sister Bella, Tiffany Haddish, and other party attendees.  Though Gigi walked at the Brandon Maxwell show where the bag made its debut, she was not one of the lucky models who got to tote it down the designer's Texas-themed runway. The collection also included clear bags that held cowboy hats from the designer's chic new collaboration with Gigi Burris (though we're slightly partial to the ones carrying the ros√©, obviously). Next spring's bag trends are already shaping up to be fresh and fun, but this one truly takes the spot of our most-coveted so far.

 "Don‚Äôt change yourself .. Change the GAME!!" Model Halima Aden made Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue history by becoming the first Muslim woman to wear a hijab and burkini in the magazine. While the annual issue has been around since 1964 and has given us legends such as Tyra Banks, Christy Brinkley, and Kate Upton (who famously sported barely-there bathing suits), this year's installment marks the first time the magazine has incorporated these modest styles into its editorials.  Aden, who is Somali-American, was born in Kenya and lived at the Kakuma Refugee Camp until she was seven years old before moving to the U.S., according to SI Swim. Her editorial came full circle when the crew photographed the 21-year-old model in her picturesque homeland.   ‚ÄúI never really felt represented, because I never could flip through a magazine and see a girl who was wearing a hijab.‚Äù @halima #shatteringperceptions #SISwim ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ @hemingwayscollection @officialkenyaairways #HemingwaysWatamu #LetKQTakeYouThere A post shared by  Sports Illustrated Swimsuit (@si_swimsuit) on Apr 29, 2019 at 8:19am PDT "We brought her to both the turquoise water and white sand beaches of coastal Malindi and the mind-blowing Masai Mara at Hemingway‚Äôs Ol Seki Mara Camp," editor M.J. Day told People. "Everything she saw was a first for her, and when we touched down on the airstrip on the Mara, there were giraffes roaming around, just seemingly waiting for us right there and she just lost it." For Aden, the opportunity to take part in a momentous shoot without compromising her morals and values is both exciting and validating. She posted a stunning image from the shoot and behind-the-scenes video to her Instagram, along with an empowering caption:     Don‚Äôt change yourself .. Change the GAME!! Ladies anything is possible!!! Being in Sports Illustrated is so much bigger than me. It‚Äôs sending a message to my community and the world that women of all different backgrounds, looks, upbringings... can stand together and be celebrated. Thank you so much @si_swimsuit & the entire team for giving me this incredible opportunity. A post shared by  Halima (@halima) on Apr 29, 2019 at 11:21am PDT  Lensed by photographer Yu Tsai, Aden wore two custom-made burkinis, one of which was created by Cynthia Rowley, according to ELLE. "When we were approached to create a custom burkini for Halima, I was so honored," Rowley said in a press release. "Halima is making strides in the industry through her powerful voice and she is now the first model in history to wear a burkini in the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue. This moment in particular marks a huge win for women‚Äôs empowerment, shattering outdated standards of beauty and identity in the industry."  Like her peers Priyanka Chopra, Vanessa Williams, and Olivia Culpo, Aden previously competed in beauty pageants. When she was 19 years old in 2016, Aden participated in the Miss Minnesota USA competition and wore her hijab throughout the event, according to the Today Show. She also wore a burkini during the swimwear portion of the event.  Although she only made it to the semi-finals of the pageant, Aden eventually signed with IMG Models. (Gisele Bundchen, Alek Wek, and a slew of Victoria's Secret Angels are all signed to the agency). Since then, she's landed various campaigns (Fenty Beauty!!), editorials, and walked down numerous runways (including Kanye West's Yeezy season five show).

 The super closed the show at Marc Jacobs.  We've been graced with supermodel runway appearances from Naomi, Kate, Cindy, Carla, and Claudia in the last couple years, but one super who's notably remained off the runway? Christy Turlington Burns.  All of that changed tonight when the legendary model came out of runway retirement to close the show at Marc Jacobs. The appearance marked her first on the catwalk in over 20 years, with her last walk taking place back in the 1990s. For her grand return, Christy hit the runway in a black feather cocktail dress with a matching fascinator and black leather boots.   Just one month after turning 50 years old, the supermodel looked as stunning as ever in the show. The last time she walked a runway for Marc Jacobs was back in 1993, when she modeled his famous grunge collection for Perry Ellis. Her look tonight, however, was anything but grunge.    On Instagram, the supermodel explained why she returned to the runway after all these years. "I turned 50 this year and have arrived at a place where 'Why the F not' is the answer that comes up when I ask myself questions," she wrote.  But her 15-year-old daughter, Grace Burns, also played a part in the decision. "I have a 15 year old daughter who I desperately want to see and hear me and this is a medium that 'speaks' to her," Turlington explained before crediting today's generation of models for inspiring her daughter. "So, thank you‚Äôs are in order, @karliekloss @gigihadid and @kaiagerber and all the lovely young women I have met briefly in the recent past or met tonight. You are ALL women I would want my daughter to emulate in your grace, confidence and elegance."   About tonight! OMG @themarcjacobs invited me to close his beautiful show tonight and I couldn‚Äôt resist. A. I have known and loved this man since I met him at age 16. B. I turned 50 this year and have arrived at a place where ‚ÄúWhy the F not‚Äù is the answer that comes up when I ask myself questions. C. I have a 15 year old daughter who I desperately want to see and hear me and this is a medium that ‚Äúspeaks‚Äùto her. So, thank you‚Äôs are in order, @karliekloss @gigihadid and @kaiagerber and all the lovely young women I have met briefly in the recent past or met tonight.  You are ALL women I would want my daughter to emulate in your grace, confidence and elegance. Always reassuring to have @guidopalau @diane.kendal @stephenjonesmillinery and @kegrand encouraging you on and making you look and feel your best. And while that muscle did not hurt as much as I would have thought to exercise again, after 20 plus years, I am not certain I could beat the experience of tonight or wish to try! Now I can say exactly when and for whom I last walked a runway and feel so proud and grateful to all the forces of nature who made it possible! üòò@1.800.newbold & Congratulations for all of the amazing people who put shows like this together. I am in awe of the efforts I was able to witness firsthand and truly appreciate from a new perspective over the last couple of days all the effort that goes in. Bravo! A post shared by  Christy Turlington Burns (@cturlington) on Feb 13, 2019 at 6:46pm PST As for whether her daughter will follow in her modeling footsteps? Christy  Turlington Burns wasn't the only notable name to walk Marc Jacobs' Fall 2019 show though. Karlie Kloss and Lindsey Wixson, both of whose runway cameos are rare these days, hit the catwalk along with Kaia Gerber and Gigi Hadid.  Leave it to Marc to close out New York Fashion Week with a truly epic casting.  Watch the full Marc Jacobs Fall 2019 runway show below:

 Never-before-seen shoes will be on display alongside iconic designs. In February of next year, a landmark exhibition of Christian Louboutin's designs will open at Paris's Palais de la Porte Dor√©e‚Äîand for fashion historians and red sole-devotees alike, the retrospective should be a must-see. The show will display a selection of designs from Louboutin's oeuvre, which by his own estimate comprises over 15,000 shoes and boots. Among them will be pieces from his personal collection, some of which have never been seen before. Other shoes set to make their public debut? The sartorial results of Louboutin's many collaborations. Expect stained-glass made with Maison du Vitrail, a silver Sevillian palanquin, and many more off-the-wall creations. The show will also include references that have inspired Louboutin's collections. Many of the designer's favorite creatives‚Äîlike director David Lynch, designer pair Whitaker Malem, choreographer Blanca Li, and artists Lisa Reihana and Imran Qureshi‚Äîhave developed relationships with Louboutin, and collaborated with him in turn. This exchange his key to Louboutin's success, as he continues to crank out hundreds of shoe designs year after year, with no creative plateau in sight. "Where ever I go, there is always a garden to see, or a museum, a church, a concert, some element of architectural design," Louboutin says, per Vogue Paris. "The main tool I use to stay inspired is open-mindedness, I try to go where others won‚Äôt." The as-now-untitled exhibition will be on view from February 25 to July 28, 2020 at the Palais de la Porte Dor√©e. Olivier Gabet, the director of Paris's Museum of Decorative Arts, is curating the show.

 The model joins Ashley Graham and more in the brand's new ads.  From a range of ages to body types, Swimsuits for All has become known for its swimsuit ads featuring diverse casts of women. In its latest campaign, titled 'Power Suit,' the brand tapped a group of women ages 30 to 67 years old to show off its newest swim styles for summer. And starring front and center in the new ads is none other than the legendary Brooke Shields.   Swimsuits for All red bikini, $50, SHOP At 52 years old, the model/actress sizzles in a red bikini in a series of photos‚Äîand she looks incredible. Appearing in both group photos and her own solo shots, Shields poses in her power suit of choice (a red bikini, of course), but admitted she hasn't always felt so confident in her body:  "Growing up under such scrutiny led me to feel insecure about my looks...And now, after 50 years in the spotlight, I can confidently say that my 'Power Suit' is being in my own skin, showing my body and not hiding it. I loved being able to share that with these women who have also come to that realization," Shields said in a statement from the brand.   Swimsuits for All red bikini, $50, SHOP Shields is one of five women featured in the campaign‚Äîall of whom come from different professions, are different ages, and have different body types. The rest of the cast includes 67-year-old professional swimmer Pat Gallant Charette, 30-year-old reality star Angela Simmons, 37-year-old nurse practitioner Katie Duke, and 30-year-old Ashley Graham‚ÄîSwimsuits for All's frequent collaborator.  The purpose of the "Power Suit" campaign is to empower women to feel just as confident in their bathing suits as they do in their professional attire. And if you're in need of some swimsuit confidence this summer (and really, who isn't?), look no further than the campaign images and video below.   Ditch your work attire. The swimsuit is the new #PowerSuit. Your only job is to wear one. See the campaign via link in bio.

 The designer is parting ways with the brand "effective immediately."  The announcement that Raf Simons is leaving Calvin Klein has come as somewhat of a surprise. The New York Times broke the news on Friday, revealing that Simons' departure comes "six months before his contract was due for renewal, and is effective immediately." No successor has been named, and it's unclear what the next steps will be for either the brand or the designer. The New York Times notes that the relationship between Simons and the brand was irreparably fractured last month when the chief executive of the corporation that owns Calvin Klein apparently appeared to blame the chief creative officer for declining sales.     The Calvin Klein Collection was renamed as Calvin Klein 205W39NYC under Raf Simons, and created the perfect opportunity for the brand to revisit some of its most iconic designs, while reimagining key looks through the creative director's own inimitable lens. A new HQ was opened in Paris back in March 2018, with a view to showing Simons' collections in the architecturally impressive space.   SUBSCRIBE
 Introducing Le 17 Septembre, BITE Studios, The Sant, and Naturae Sacra for the FW19 season of the Vanguard. To lead or not to lead? That is the question that Net-a-Porter set out to answer when it launched the Vanguard, a program for dawning designers who receive mentorship from and have their labels stocked by the e-commerce site. In the Vanguard's third season, Net-a-Porter has announced the four new brands it plans to catapult into the fashion limelight in the upcoming fall/winter season. For the first time since the program's genesis, the site scouted for new Vanguard representatives through Instagram, sifting through the endless cache of online brands by focusing on sustainability. The fruit of its foraging? We introduce to you Le 17 Septembre, BITE Studios, The Sant, and Naturae Sacra.  "Over the past two seasons, we have loved witnessing the positive effect the Vanguard mentorship program has on these emerging brands. It's so important for us to be able to share our insight in a meaningful way and aim towards a shared goal of long-lasting success," said Elizabeth von der Goltz, the site's global buying director, in a press release. "One year after launch, we are thrilled to announce the next wave of exciting new designers who all offer something completely unique to the market." This Seoul-based label features minimalist pieces that add structure to any wardrobe. Eunhye Shin, a self-taught designer, launched Le 17 Septembre in 2013.  This luxury womenswear label, founded in 2016, makes sustainability the heart of its design. Its slinky camisoles and braided sweaters are all made of top-notch organic and recycled materials. This Barcelona-based brand features one-of-a-kind leather handbags. From the handles to the hardware finishes, each detail has been meticulously crafted.  Bags from Naturae Sacra are the love child of vintage-wear and minimalism. Resin handles and soft palettes make up the bread and honey of this Milan-based label.
 The model's latest collection for Swimsuits for All is here.  Ashley Graham is no stranger to empowering women to feel their best in swimsuits. Along with designing her own collections for Swimsuits for All, the model has starred in several campaigns for the brand‚Äîincluding last season's Moroccan beach shoot alongside her mom.   For her latest swim campaign, however, Graham is taking her body positivity up a level by posing in raw, unretouched paparazzi photos for the swimsuit ads.  In the series of images, the model can be seen frolicking on the beach in her latest bikini and one-piece swimsuit designs.  "I hope these images instill a fearless belief in everyone to be happy in their own skin and enjoy living in the moment, no matter who is watching," Graham said of the new photos in a statement from the brand. On Instagram, she added, "Reminder: being authentic is beautiful."  In an age of obsessive Photoshop and Facetuning Instagrams beyond recognition, the unedited photos serve as a breath of fresh air, reminding us all we don't have to stress over having "the perfect beach body." And as a crusader of the body positivity movement, that's been Graham's mission all along.  The model's ongoing collaboration with Swimsuits for All is meant to empower women of all sizes to embrace their bodies and feel sexy. Offering a range of inclusive sizes, the suits go from size 4- 34 and are almost all available to shop for under $100.

 Lindbergh was behind the lens of some of fashion's most legendary imagery. Lindbergh was behind the lens of some of fashion's most iconic imagery. From capturing the '90s supermodels as angels, to his signature black and white portraits, his work made a statement on the pages of Harper's BAZAAR and beyond. Lindbergh's vision redefined fashion photography as a whole, highlighting natural beauty through his raw portraits and forgoing heavy airbrushing. His stunning photographs helped cement the status of the '90s supers we revere today, and his images will forever stand the test of time.

So let‚Äôs go back in time to a post-90s moment of exuberance. There were feathers and sequins on Kaia Gerber, Gigi and Bella Hadid, as well as bold suits, hats, flower embossed coats, tweedy jackets. In other words a hodgepodge of fashion as frivolity with a nod to icons past like Anita Pallenberg and Lee Radziwill. It sure is a good time, but does it align with our time? ‚ÄîKerry Pieri Moscone has been a bit of a fashion insider secret, but that‚Äôs not going to last for long. The designer brought an audience to a Gramercy Park mansion to a show a ‚Äò90s meets ‚Äò60s collection that was nothing short of a winner. Inspired by the book Ninth Street Women, about female post war artists that changed the world, from Lee Krasner to Elaine de Kooning‚Äîwomen who may have been partners to famous male artists but artists in their own right. With screenplays on each seat and oil paintings hung in the pre-war space, it was a magical set-up for sleek, minimal clothes that leverage artful layering, some interesting prints, florals, and a deft melding of masculine and feminine. In other words, thoroughly modern with an appreciation for the past.  During a season of bright colors and prints, Dion Lee found beauty in a clean slate. In a collection of neutrals, defined by crisp white shirting and classic wardrobe pieces, it was the details that really made a mark. Utility bralettes worn both over dresses and solo made for a cool way to get Katie Holme‚Äôs recent cashmere bra look that the Internet still hasn‚Äôt recovered from. Then there were leather garder belts and harnesses that managed to look elegant when paired with turtleneck dresses and tailored blazers. It was a reminder that even the most simple and classic of pieces can feel exciting with the right details, styling, and accessories. ‚ÄîLauren Alexis Fisher  There‚Äôs no mistaking a Brock Collection show‚ÄîVictorian-inspired, ultra-feminine, full of frills, with just the right amount of edge. But this season, the brand felt more‚Ä¶grown up. Scoring a slot on the final day of New York Fashion Week, a coveted day reserved for the likes of landmark brands like Michael Kors and Marc Jacobs, the show mixed and matched cocktail attire with denim and ball gowns with trousers and flats in a way that felt like New Brock Collection. It seems that Laura Vassar and Kristopher Brock have evolved their forest-nymph-meets-Miss-Havisham into a more adult version of herself, one that isn‚Äôt afraid to dress up and down at the same time; one that isn‚Äôt afraid to loosen her pussy bow and her corset, and then throw on a pair of jeans. This collection didn‚Äôt feel overly polished, prim, or sentimental, but Vassar and Brock still brought the drama in the form of oversized bows, voluminous ball skirting, and billowing trains, albeit worn with rumpled denim. ‚ÄîCarrie Goldberg Michael Kors is taking back America. The Young People‚Äôs Chorus of New York sang Americana songs like notables by Simon and Garfunkel and ‚ÄúAmerica the Beautiful‚Äù next to the water at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. The look was nautical meets ‚Äò40s, a time when women went to work to help keep the country afloat amidst the upheaval of WWII. There were also cashmere knits with the word ‚Äúhate‚Äù crossed out, some punchy lemon prints, and standout suiting. The word of the day was optimism, not an easy one to embrace, but nice to see nonetheless. ‚ÄîKerry Pieri Gabriela Hearst put on fashion‚Äôs first carbon neutral show‚Äîeven the models walked with wet hair to avoid the electricity from hair dryers. But the power came from referencing powerhouse ladies both real and mythic‚ÄîJosephine Baker, the goddess Athena, female Kurdish fighters, and Maria Sibylla Merian, the German-born naturalist and scientific illustrator. The artisan-crafted pieces on the runway take minimal, streamlined ideas to special places‚Äînetting falling off of a black gown, a white coat with fringe, suits with slit trousers, an agate belt‚Äîthat something cool and different that allows a woman stand out without allowing the clothes to wear her. ‚ÄîKerry Pieri

 Stiletto Ugg mules are also a thing now too.   Ugg boots may have garnered a reputation for being a bit...well, basic since their takeover in the early 2000s, but the latest styles are anything but. In collaboration with French fashion brand Y/Project, Ugg unveiled its latest shoe‚Äîand it's not the classic boot we've all grown accustomed to seeing. Hitting the runway at Paris Fashion Week, the newest Uggs are slouchy, thigh-high boots complete with stiletto heels.    The boots, which hit the runway in both black and the brand's signature chestnut hue, were modeled two ways: folded down and sky-high, with some of the boots looking more like Ugg pants in several looks. These are definitely not your Uggs reserved for coffee runs, walking the dog, or lazy days.    Also newly unveiled as part of the collaboration were a pair of high-heeled Ugg mules, worn with a pair of straight leg jeans.  "The UGG Classic boot is one of the most recognizable shoes in history. It's timeless and challenging design made it a worldwide statement. By reworking the Classic boot with a typical Y/Project twist such as the triple overlaps and the extra-long legs we want to celebrate the UGG brand's unique history," Glenn Martens, creative director of Y/Project, said in a statement from the brand.    Of course, this isn't the first time we've seen over-the-knee Ugg boots. Y/Project and Ugg previously collaborated last month during Men's Fashion Week in Paris on an array of thigh-high styles for both men and women.  Thigh-high Uggs, it seems, are really trying to happen this season. Are you on board? 
 Lily Kwong used to walk runways‚Äînow she designs landscapes. Here's how she stays stylish (and still green). You probably know Lily Kwong from her days gracing the glossy pages of magazines and working for fashion labels in New York and Paris. But lately, the California-born, New York-based model has been spending her time working on something slightly more down-to-earth: landscape design. But although her career has switched out of the fashion space, fashion isn‚Äôt removed from her life. Now, Kwong pays special attention to brands with sustainable practices and indeed, those that have more of a botanical and grounded feeling. Which is why a one-stop-shop like Saks, which carries ethical and sustainable brands like Stella McCartney, Maggie Marilyn and The Row, is an important destination. ‚ÄúI've always had an intuitive connection to plants,‚Äù says Kwong, who spent her childhood exploring the wild coast and moody forests of Northern California. It‚Äôs a connection that eventually lead her to pursue a degree in Urban Studies at Columbia University, and then a host of botanical-inspired projects with fashion brands like Maiyet‚Äîa natural progression, given all her fashion-world connections. Then, last year, things got more real: Kwong decided to go all-out and establish her own landscape design company, Studio Lily Kwong.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been the most fulfilling, challenging, and creative period of my life,‚Äù Kwong says. And indeed, her project calendar has been packed. She‚Äôs created a botanical sculpture at Miami‚Äôs Faena Hotel for Art Basel; constructed an immersive flower installation at the Houdini Mansion in L.A.; and transformed a quarter mile of New York‚Äôs High Line into a hanging garden of blooms as part of a collaboration with Saint Germain. ‚ÄúI often wondered if I wasted time interning at photo galleries or working in the fashion industry,‚Äù Kwong muses. ‚ÄúBut as my work has developed, I‚Äôm able to see that all my interests are inextricably linked and my wide-ranging experience is responsible for my unique point of view. There is a gift and a lesson in every ‚Äòfalse-start.‚Äô‚Äù   Fendi top, $1,100, saks.com; Fendi skirt, $990, saks.com; Fendi shoes, $750, saks.com That newfound sense of self and purpose has influenced other areas of her life, too‚Äîincluding her personal style. ‚ÄùWhen I was in my early twenties, I was more swayed by trends,‚Äù she explains. ‚ÄúNow my closet is really tightly edited and I rely on pieces that suit my body and feel intentional. I also try my best to support mindful brands that either make thoughtful clothes or are sustainable‚ÄîStella McCartney, the Row, Mara Hoffman. What you wear reflects your values, and I believe in female creatives, art, and good vibes." Khaite jacket, $1,420, saks.com; The Row jacket, $3,290, saks.com; The Row pants, $2,390, saks.com; Oscar de la Renta earrings, $195, saks.com But despite the success‚Äîand press‚Äîher fledgling landscaping career has garnered, Kwong remains focused on her original intent: to help others reconnect with nature and to inspire them to be more in touch with their environments‚Äîand themselves. It‚Äôs something she believes in whole-heartedly, because she‚Äôs seen for herself how much these acts matter. ‚ÄúReconnecting with nature completely transformed my career and, much more profoundly, my life," she says. "When I started working with plants again, my purpose became clear: my gift is alchemizing nature and culture, and bringing the natural world back into urban life.‚Äù Stella McCartney top, $875, saks.com; Stella McCartney pants, $895, saks.com; Manolo Blahnik shoes, $645, saks.com Kwong mentions a favorite quote by Clarissa Pinkol Estes, from her book Women Who Run With the Wolves: ‚Äú‚ÄòGo out in the woods, go out. If you don‚Äôt go out in the woods nothing will ever happen and your life will never begin.‚Äô Beyond spending more time in the physical woods, this advice also guided me out into my own mental and spiritual wilderness,‚Äù Kwong says. ‚ÄúI started unplugging from expectations, judgement, and timelines; I began building my own approach to life from the bottom up‚Äîand I relived myself of living for anyone else but me.‚Äù   3.1 Phillip Lim top, $650, saks.com; Carven skirt, $690, saks.com; Paul Andrew shoes, $695, saks.com This spring, Kwong will launch a floral pop-up at The Whitney Museum shop, followed by an installation on the High Line this summer. Then, this fall, she‚Äôll unveil a project particularly close to her heart: the gardens of Shou Sugi Ban House, a 3-acre destination spa in Southampton. ‚ÄúI have been developing the design for well over a year, and it‚Äôs my first permanent commercial site‚Äîit feels like my firstborn,‚Äù says Kwong. ‚ÄúIt's very aligned with my personal values and my passion in creating long-term green spaces that can evolve with a community: I am committed to working on more long-term development projects that are inclusive, inspiring, and sustainable.‚Äù Stella McCartney jumpsuit, $1,625, saks.com To that end, Kwong is quick to offer easy advice for anyone who wants to infuse their own day-to-day with more nature. ‚ÄúGo on hikes, plant a tree in your garden, cook vegetables for dinner, make your own herbal apothecary, give someone you love a plant,‚Äù she advises. ‚ÄúIt starts with small gestures‚Äîit really is that simple. When you reconnect with plants, you recognize their healing properties. I believe human beings have an innate connection to nature‚Äîour bare feet are supposed to know the touch of soil, our lungs the feeling of fresh air. You will remember; your nervous system will calm down. You will start to care. Then you‚Äôll start cultivating more life on all levels: in your little herb garden, in your community, in yourself.‚Äù Proenza Schouler top, $950, saks.com; Proenza Schouler skirt, $1,395, saks.com; Theory trench, $595, saks.com Styling by Gabrielle Marceca, Makeup by Mark Edio, Hair by Charles McNair
 As informed by Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, obviously. Of course, it goes without saying that a girl can get by with just the right puffer or cozy wool coat all winter long. But if we're talking about building an outwear wardrobe, look no further than Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and her well-curated toppers for inspiration. From a peacoat to a teddy to something camel, shop these 10 coats that are RHW approved.  Something animal print can help dress up those long days of denim and boots after denim and boots. A great camel coat is quite truly a forever piece. Find one that you'll love forever and ever.  The not-so-humble peacoat is the undercover secret of so many good late-fall and early-winter looks. We don't use the word smart in reference to clothing often, but it applies here. The secret to a great puffer is that you can basically climb Everest in it and still manage to look cute. Just take Huntington-Whiteley  for instance.  A shearling-and-leather jacket has cool factor and will keep you warm enough to saunter through the tundra that is NYC in the winter. It can be a long, gray winter‚Äîbring a little spark back with a vibrant-hued coat. A true must of those subject to the Northeast between the months of November and March, the teddy coat, especially this one by Max Mara, is as cozy  and outrageously warm as it is chic.  Take a cool plaid jacket as an opportunity to layer your best cashmere sweaters and tees. Though sometimes a giant puffer is called for, there are plenty of occasions for something less duvetlike.  A great ‚Äúwear to the office or with jeans to brunch‚Äù black coat will take you miles all winter long.  We love the idea of a shiny statement jacket for winter; it proves we won't let this chill get us down or damper our killer sense of style.
 Another high fashion sneaker may be on its way.  Could Pharrell, Chanel, and Adidas all be teaming up for the next must-have sneaker? According to rumors and newly-surfaced images, it just might happen.  Footwear News reports that Pharrell's highly-coveted Adidas Human Race NMD sneakers may be getting the Chanel treatment after a mock-up photo of the rumored collaboration surfaced on Twitter.  adidas Originals x Pharrell x CHANEL NMD HUMAN RACE Coming soon #MafiaSZN pic.twitter.com/xPkms3gpNC Shared by streetwear account Yeezy Mafia, the images reveal two-tone black and white sneakers with ‚ÄúPHARRELL‚Äù embroidered down the left shoe and ‚ÄúCHANEL‚Äù down the right. Though it's unclear if and when the sneaker collaboration is happening, the account wrote that it was "coming soon." Though the collab hasn't been confirmed by Chanel or Adidas as of yet, this wouldn't be Pharrell's first time collaborating with either one of the fashion brands. Along with frequently wearing Chanel and attending the fashion house's runway shows, Pharrell also recently starred in the brand's handbag campaign. As for Adidas, the singer has several sneaker collaborations with the brand under his belt already.  If true, there's no doubt these sneakers will instantly sell out between the fashion and sneakerhead set. 
 AKA: Justification for splurging on those Gucci loafers.  Playing the stock market can be lucrative, but for those with sartorial tendencies, it can also be boring. In an age when investing in speculative indexes is all the rage and confidence in cryptocurrency is catapulting, buying rare, limited edition, vintage and designer wares can pay off just as well‚Äîif not more than traditional investment opportunities. But first, it‚Äôs important to understand how to increase your return on investment. ‚ÄúIf you hope for your purchase to not only accrue value, but to do so in a short period of time, then it‚Äôs wise to pay attention to limited edition releases from timeless luxury brands,‚Äù says Lindsay Sakraida, director of content marketing with comparison shopping site DealNews.  Pay attention to limited edition releases from timeless luxury brands This is especially true of items that aren‚Äôt available online, but beyond limited editions, Sakraida says it‚Äôs usually safer to stick to brands that have a timeless appeal when considering investment pieces. ‚ÄúThe name should connote quality both now and in the future, and that‚Äôs difficult to predict from newer brands. Herm√®s, Chanel, Tiffany & Co. and Rolex are all brands that have persistent value,‚Äù says Sakraida. Nicole Lapin, New York Times bestselling author of Rich Bitch: A Simple 12-Step Plan for Getting Your Financial Life Together‚Ä¶Finally agrees, but she has some advice for those questioning whether or not they should pull the trigger on a five or six-figure handbag. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve come up with a financial justification for splurging‚Äîbasically you have to look at the cost of the item, and then you divide it by the times you use the item, factor in some maintenance and see whether that amount is greater than 65 percent of the original price,‚Äù says Lapin.   Regardless of how much something costs and how well-known its label may be, investment pieces need to be kept in exceptional condition in the event they end up being resold. ‚ÄúThe more wear and tear an item appears to have, the less you‚Äôre going to get for it,‚Äù says Sakraida. But just because you wear it, doesn‚Äôt mean it will lose all of its value. Lapin says, ‚ÄúIf you buy wisely, you can enjoy the item while you have it and have the peace of mind that it will retain value if you ever need to sell it.‚Äù For this reason, bags can be a better bet than shoes because they‚Äôre easier to maintain, even with regular use, whereas, in order for shoes to amass an impressive amount of return, soles should be gently worn at most. Inflation also plays a role in value‚Äîthe current rate of inflation is 2.1 percent, meaning a $10,000 purchase in 2007 is the equivalent of $12,000 today. NerdWallet‚Äôs consumer savings expert, Courtney Jespersen, says there can be risks involved when making these purchases and that putting money into a retirement fund or high-yield savings account is a better option for some. ‚ÄúPurchasing luxury bags as a side hustle may require a hefty initial investment, possibly thousands of dollars, without a guarantee of the payoff. There‚Äôs a risk that your purchase could lose value and be worth less than when you originally bought it,‚Äù says Jespersen.   The more wear and tear an item appears to have, the less you‚Äôre going to get for it So what are the gems in your closet that are likely worth more than you paid for them? Alison Stiefel, VP of marketing at ShopStyle says, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre seeing luxury iconic handbags trending because shoppers see them as forever classics worth the investment because the value consistently increases year after year.‚Äù And surprisingly, there are quite a few sneakers that not only hold their value, but actually command even more than their original price the older they get. ‚ÄúThe Golden Goose Deluxe Brand was our number one searched sneaker in 2017 and the Balenciaga Speed Knit Sneaker was a close second,‚Äù she says.   For someone like former stylist JoJo Cohen Fleiss, who admittedly has a knack for acquiring investment pieces, holding on to her designer wares allows them to become family heirlooms. ‚ÄúI have a closet full of treasures‚Äîincluding Gucci and Hermes scarves from my late grandmother. I have the first Prada bag I received when I was 13 and even though I haven‚Äôt worn it in decades, I‚Äôll never get rid of it,‚Äù says Fleiss. ‚ÄúI hate to say it, but some of these things are like my version of a pet!‚Äù    Here are some of the smartest investment pieces:   The highly coveted, ultra-luxurious Birkin and Kelly bags have always been in demand due to their extremely limited availability. Vestiaire Collective‚Äôs United States VIP manager Greta Kuper says the Birkin will never go out of style‚Äîhence its hefty price point that begins at roughly $10,000 for the smallest style.  ‚ÄúWhen purchasing a second-hand Birkin, be sure to closely examine the photos and description of the item," says Kuper. "Vestiaire Collective checks every item to ensure they‚Äôre authentic pieces and exactly as described and pictured, checking for significant call outs like measurements or markings." Previously owned Birkin bags easily sell for $10,000 with many styles and sizes selling between $20,000 and $40,000.   This classic 2.55 handbag debuted in February 1955 for $220 and currently resells for upwards of $4,900 for both vintage and current styles. Emily Perlstein, stylist and co-founder of luxury denim line La Detresse says, ‚ÄúAs a personal shopper, I almost always find a Chanel double flap bag in a woman‚Äôs closet. I encourage my clients to resell things to keep their closets organized and full of pieces they actually love and want to wear‚Äîbut this bag almost always stays.‚Äù   These famed timepieces have maintained their position at the top according to The Jewellery Editor because Rolex was the first brand to develop a water-resistant case and they‚Äôre second to none in terms of quality. ‚ÄúOne of my most coveted items is a Bamford & Sons Rolex," says collector Cohen Fleiss. "I treat purchases like this as a true investment and most of them are insured.‚Äù  A basic Rolex Submariner costs about $7,500 and pricing increases from there based on the model and materials used. In 2017, Paul Newman‚Äôs Rolex Daytona sold for $17.8 million, making it the most expensive watch sold at auction.   These watches have been known to set auction house records, partly because it‚Äôs rumored that fewer than one million Patek Philippe pieces have been made since 1839, according to auction house Christies.  Selling for more than double their retail price, a Patek Philippe watch that cost less than $20,000 in the 1980s can presently garner more than $400,000. Today, an entry level timepiece runs about $20,000 and is almost certain to appreciate over time.   With each style of Kanye West‚Äôs eight-year-old shoe company being produced in runs of 40,000, and only 5,000 of his Nike Air Yeezys potentially in existence, it‚Äôs no surprise that sneaker blog Sole Collector values many of his sneakers at more than five times their original retail value. The Nike Air Yeezy Red October kicks that were released in February of 2014 for just $250 have an average resell value of $5,631.    ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre a classic buy, but on trend in both new and vintage styles,‚Äù says Kuper. Initially designed in 1953, the horsebit loafer is reinvented every season, yet the original black leather variety remains the most popular style. Currently, the Gucci Jordaan leather loafer retails for $730, though the vintage variety and discontinued styles can sell for around $1,100.   With an entry level price of more than $4,000 for a solid yellow gold Love Bracelet and a white gold and diamond-paved one currently available on Cartier‚Äôs website for $56,000, these classic adornments hold their value based on the fact that they‚Äôre made by an elite, world renowned jewelry company.  Whereas handbags and shoes can sustain damage easily, jewelry carries value regardless of the brand. ‚ÄúEven if there was no longer a desire for Cartier, a diamond bracelet will always be valuable,‚Äù Sakraida notes. Designer resale site The RealReal lists worn bangles starting at $4,195 for an 18k white gold version which sells for $4,350 new.   Though their most popular function of late may be an artistic touch to another accessory, such as wrapped around the handle of an Herm√®s handbag, these silk scarves have always been associated with luxury. Presently selling for $395 a pop, the 36‚Äù x 36‚Äù silk squares have sold second hand for as much as a few thousand dollars, depending on the style, season and story behind each sash.  With each one produced in France and silkscreened by hand featuring artwork from various artists such as Hugo Grygkar, Kermit Oliver and Eugene Brunelle, the company‚Äôs limited vintage pieces are worth the most. Multiple previously owned cashmere silk shawls are available on The RealReal for $995 and though they‚Äôre listed as being in ‚Äúvery good‚Äù condition, they may show light wear throughout and can be missing fabric tags.   With its iconic plaid accents and classic double-breasted silhouette, this wardrobe staple currently retails between $795 and $7,000 depending on length, material and style. What if it rains? Lapin says, ‚ÄúA Burberry trench can hold its value or increase value over time even with use.‚Äù In the last few years, the British fashion house has reported an increase in sales, largely due to their UK-made line of premium coats. Used trenches can fetch $1,000, depending on the style.   In 2017, this cult streetwear brand was valued at a whopping $1 billion. Known for their super limited releases and artist capsule collections, fans and collectors line up in droves to ensure they‚Äôll get their hands on T-shirts, hoodies and shoes before they sell out.   What‚Äôs even more impressive is the brand‚Äôs secondary market value‚Äîpieces from the 2017 fall/winter Supreme x Louis Vuitton collection have already sold for double their retail value. A new T-shirt from the collaboration cost $485 and later sold on eBay for $2,500 while a hoodie that retailed for $935 hit the resale market for $5,000.
 See every studded, shimmery look here. This year's Victoria's Secret Fashion Show featured a one-of-a-kind collaboration with Balmain, marking the first time the lingerie giant teamed up with a high-end designer for runway looks and a retail collection. In addition to crafting custom ensembles for the models, Balmain's creative director Olivier Rousteing also helped the VS team create a shoppable range for consumers. Victoria's Secret x Balmain is available in-store and online starting November 29 (the day after the fashion show airs on CBS).  The theme of the collaboration was simple: punk. The edgy-meets-sexy aesthetic was right up Balmain's and VS's alley. "We believe in the same kind of woman, a powerful lady, a strong and confident, sexy girl that knows what she wants," Rousteing said of their collab. The result on the runway included ultra-studded leather jackets, laced-up over-the-knee boots, and all of the plaid, safety pins, spikes, and chains you thought possible. The capsule was sported by veteran Angels and Victoria's Secret rookies alike for today's taping. Before you see the looks on TV next week, or scour for their shoppable counterparts online, take a look at how the collaboration came to life on the runway.

 Pick which supermodel sister has the better street style‚Äîthen shop it. Bella and Gigi Hadid are just about as chic as sisters come. In addition to sharing amazing genes, the supermodels siblings share a fondness of high fashion and athleisure. Yet although they'll often borrow each other's clothes (Bella raids her big sis' closet) or coordinate outfits, but they manage to never look too matchy-matchy. Gigi keeps it classic, while younger sister Bella flaunts a subtle sexy edge. From monochromatic all-white ensembles to the model off-duty favorite, the Canadian tuxedo, the Hadid gals have tried all the street style fashion trends‚Äîbut in drastically different ways.

 Meet the brother-sister duo behind HAVVA.  When you hear the words "family-run business," flame-adorned stilettos and leather moto cowboy boots aren't typically the first things that come to mind. Proving HAVVA, a family-run shoe brand based in London, is anything but typical.  Helmed by sister-and-brother design duo Havva and Ali Mustafa, HAVVA is quickly becoming the go-to shoe brand for cool girls across the globe. The brand's collection of footwear ranges from striking neon boots to houndstooth stilettos to streetwear-inspired designs‚Äîmixing skate culture with luxury and merch adorned with their "Cool girls don't sleep" mantra. It's an unexpected formula that shouldn't work for footwear, and yet it completely does.  Havva and Ali each considered careers in other industries (law and architecture, respectively), but they couldn't resist their family calling to shoes. Both their father (who teaches shoemaking at Central Saint Martins) and grandfather worked in the industry. Making it a complete family affair, the waste-conscious collection is made in a family-owned factory in Turkey. A rising name to know, Havva also teaches at both Central Saint Martins and the London College of Fashion‚Äîwhere she's taught and mentored several other footwear designers including Neil J. Rodgers, Julia Nodaleto, and Jennifer Chamandi. Is HAVVA the next big shoe empire to know? BAZAAR.com speaks to both Havva and Ali Mustafa about running a luxury shoe brand as siblings.  Havva Mustafa: Our father and grandfather were in the shoe industry so it was something we grew up exposed to from an early age. My mother really wanted me to study law instead so that I could make a great living, but I knew I was never cut out for it. At the last minute, I rejected my law university acceptance and managed to secure myself a place at Cordwainers London College of Fashion. After graduating, I worked as a designer for companies who would produce for trend-focused brands, but after some time, I realized it was not the right fit and I wanted to design my own small-batch collection that spoke truly to me. Ali Mustafa: I went to university to study architecture, so I never really thought I would be designing shoes. However, once the HAVVA brand started coming together, I couldn't keep myself away from it. I just felt a natural draw to designing and it woke an underlying passion inside me that I guess was always there. It felt like a natural move from architecture to footwear, as you can apply a lot of the same design principles.  I also think I was able to bring a different perspective to the brand, and that really meant we would start to develop our unique brand voice. Havva: I feel like you have to really focus on who you are and what your aesthetic is. You must be true to yourself, and I think if you stick to that, it will naturally be conveyed in your product. There is enough room for all of us designers (especially the emerging ones!) to have a creative voice and vision.  @lizaowen Celebrate the weekend early and get an additional 30% off AW18 with code EARLY30 #HAVVA #sale A post shared by  HAVVA (@havva_mustafa) on Apr 11, 2019 at 1:02am PDT Ali: It's not just the design of the product, but also the presentation. You have to speak to the customer in your own voice. You must develop your brand's personality through your social media channels, lookbooks, website, ads, and events. The key is that when someone sees a shoe, they will associate it with your brand. No matter what you try to do will have been done in some way before‚Äîthe difference is how do you interpret those ideas through your brand's creative filter. Havva: Every student is so different, and they all have their own style and personalities that is reflected in their work from very early on. I help them build the skills to create and develop as a designer, but based on their own personal influences‚Äîtheir brand DNA is often evident in their designs without them even knowing it at first. It is very rewarding to see my students flourish, I often feel like their shoe mum! They all keep in touch and send me updates regularly.  Warehouse mood @havvanm #HAVVA A post shared by  HAVVA (@havva_mustafa) on Jul 15, 2019 at 12:18am PDT Havva: The real trick to keeping the balance is to ensure I plan my timetable correctly, which often means a lot of late nights. So once my day teaching is over, I come back to the office and work on the brand with Ali until late at night.  I love teaching though, so I don't see myself giving it up anytime soon!   Havva: While I was designing at various other companies, our older brother came to me with the idea of me having my own brand, which led to him putting down the initial funding for it. Then I thought, if I'm dragging one brother into this, I might as well drag the other in as well (Ali)! Ali and I are both very much on the same wavelength on what we envision for the brand, which means that when we come to design, there is hardly any disagreement in the approach.  Our father still helps us with any technical questions we might have about the construction of a shoe as well.   Ali: I knew that with it being a young company, I had to learn as many things as possible myself in order to save on costs. So I would spend as much time as I could reading and learning anything I could get my hands on. I picked up photography, videography, web design, graphic design, and pretty much anything that I could lend a hand on. There's nothing quite like learning on the job with immense pressure. By taking on all of this, it meant that the workload balance between the two of us was easier to split as we have different roles and don't often overlap, except when we are designing the collections together.

 Just wait until you see the back...  The ancient Mayans may have ended their calendars on December 21, 2012 but let the history records reflect that the world actually ended in the year of our Lord 2017 when, amongst other things, the jeans apocalypse officially hit.  This year we've seen a growing list of unconventional denim trends but today at Amazon Fashion Week Tokyo, the most naked pair of jeans to ever exist made their official debut. Hitting the runway at new designer Thibaut's show, the barely-there style took cut-out jeans to an entirely new level with the front and back panels of the legs cut out, leaving nothing but the seams.  And if you thought that was a look, please brace yourself for the rearview (pun intended) of the jeans... Yes, thong jeans now exist and if you'll excuse me, I'm off to start my official Make Jeans Whole Again campaign. 
 The long-term partner of Saint Laurent helped create the iconic brand. Yves Saint Laurent co-founder Pierre Berg√© has died after a long illness, at age 86. The businessman and philanthropist passed away in his sleep this morning at his Paris home. "It is with immense sadness that the Fondation Pierre Berg√© - Yves Saint Laurent, Paris and the Fondation Jardin Majorelle, Marrakech, announce the death of their founding president Pierre Berg√©, which occurred on September 8, 2017, at 5:39 am, at home in Saint-R√©my-de-Provence. He died in his sleep at the age of 86 following a long illness," read a statement today. Berg√© met Saint Laurent in 1958 and they began a relationship. In 1961, they launched the iconic fashion house together. Although their romantic involvement ended in 1976, Berg√© remained by the designer's side until he died of a brain tumor in 2008.  In addition to his work in fashion, he also became known as philanthropist, becoming a vocal and active campaigner for gay rights and AIDS research. In 2015, he was awarded one of France's highest accolades‚Äîthe Grand Officier of the Ordre national de la L√©gion d'honneur. "He was a magician who made his life and those who he loved a symphony of happiness," former French culture minister Jack Lang said today. "Pierre Berg√© was above all a marvelous and loyal friend, who was there to take on all the good fights, the noble causes, in particular to provide the means for research to defeat AIDS." Francois-Henri Pinault, chairman and CEO of Kering‚Äîthe parent company of Saint Laurent‚Äîalso paid his respects, saying:

 Gisele has held the number one spot since 2002.  For nearly fifteen consecutive years, Gisele B√ºndchen held the number one spot as the highest paid model in the world. Now, for the first time since 2002, the supermodel has been dethroned from her top ranking by Kendall Jenner. According to Forbes' annual list, Jenner was this year's top earning model, bringing in a whopping $22 million. Along with campaigns for Fendi, Adidas, La Perla, Estee Lauder and more, Jenner's high-earning year was also contributed to by her several social media endorsements, Kendall + Kylie line, and of course, money earned from Keeping Up With The Kardashians.    Despite having a much quieter year with fewer campaigns and fashion projects, B√ºndchen still took the number 2 spot on the list with $17.5 million. This year, the supermodel faced Carolina Herrera's fragrance, Arezzo shoes, and Vivara jewelry‚Äîtwo accessory brands from her native Brazil.   Notably rounding out the top three is Chrissy Teigen, who made her first ever debut on the Forbes list bringing home $13.5 million this past year. Going beyond the fashion world, Teigen's earnings also stem from her multiple food and beverage deals (plus her own cookbook).  Also making a debut on this year's list is Ashley Graham, who after a whirlwind year in fashion, becomes the first curve model to make the list. Bella and Gigi Hadid, meanwhile, set their own record for becoming the first sisters to ever make the top ten list together.  See this year's full Forbes model ranking below:

 This is so emotional.  The 2018 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show will be Adriana Lima's last. The VS Angel, who has repped the lingerie brand for 20 years, announced her retirement on Instagram this evening during the taping of this year's runway extravaganza.  The model earned a standing ovation for her final walk down the VS catwalk, which was just as emotional as we expected. Instead of classic wings, Lima wore a white feathered fan-like piece on her back with a sheer sequin top, pale blue underwear, and matching feathered Brian Atwood heels.  She placed her hands on her heart and bowed her head in gratitude when she reached the end of the catwalk, and appeared to be fighting back tears as the crowd cheered her on.  In an earlier look from the show, Lima donned a black low-cut leotard and booties with a set of glittery moon and stars on her back.  Lima announced her retirement this afternoon with a heartfelt highlight reel of her past VS fashion show appearances. Today' show marks her 18th for the brand. Her first was in 1999.  "Dear Victoria, Thank you for showing me the world, sharing your secrets, and most importantly not just giving me wings but teaching me to fly. And all the ‚ù§Ô∏è to the best fans in the üåé! Love, Adriana üíñ," she captioned the video.   You can watch Lima's final walk in full when the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show airs on ABC on Sunday, December 2. Find out where to watch here.

 Pierpaolo Piccioli, the great thinker behind the Roman fashion house, looks to sculpture to inform his beautifully poetic vision.  Against an uncharacteristically gray June Parisian sky, veined with fine clouds like marble, Pierpaolo Piccioli, the 52-year-old creative director of Valentino, crouches contemplatively, brow furrowed, chin resting on fist. He‚Äôs mimicking‚Äîintentionally‚Äîthat famous Auguste Rodin sculpture The Thinker. A bronze cast is poised over his right shoulder, in the gardens of Rodin‚Äôs former home on the outskirts of the city. It‚Äôs the day after Piccioli‚Äôs Spring 2020 menswear show and less than two weeks until his Fall 2019 haute couture show. Piccioli has plenty to think about. That said, the pose is somewhat paradoxical. Not that Piccioli isn‚Äôt a thinker: His work is embedded with intellect, often referencing works of art and literature. The latter reflects his studies at Sapienza University of Rome in the 1980s, before he switched to fashion design at Istituto Europeo di Design. Nevertheless, Piccioli works not from the head but from the heart. Or maybe the soul. ‚ÄúI follow my instinct now,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI think with this job you can change people‚Äôs perception.‚Äù Incidentally, Rodin initially called that crouched-up, contemplative bronze ‚ÄúThe Poet,‚Äù which is definitely Piccioli. There is a poetic bent to his vision, one that involves chiffon and bows and cascades of taffeta and ostrich feathers in the brilliant, vivid colors of romanesque frescoes. Even his ready-to-wear is poetic: his Fall 2019 collection literally so, inspired in part by the Movement for the Emancipation of Poetry, the Italian organization that anonymously plasters the streets of Rome, where the Valentino studio is based, with its works. That was mirrored in the cut-and-paste motifs of amorously embracing neoclassical statues, flowers, and snippets of text that decorated the clothes. The prints were a collaboration, or to borrow Piccioli‚Äôs turn of phrase, a ‚Äúconversation‚Äù with Jun Takahashi of the cult Japanese label Undercover, which crossed over from his January menswear show and heightened the idea of the Valentino man and woman as star-cross‚Äôd (and well-dressed) lovers; the words were culled from spoken-word prodigy Mustafa the Poet‚Äôs performances.  Poetry and couture are things that can belong to the past. I wanted to do it in a new way so poetry could be a common language, more modern and contemporary. On every seat Piccioli placed a book of poetry, titled Valentino on Love, featuring Mustafa‚Äôs work along with that of three other contemporary poets: Yrsa Daley-Ward, Robert Montgomery, and Greta Bellamacina (incidentally, the latter two are a couple). Behind the runway, an illuminated, text-based installation created by Montgomery bore the refrain the people you love become ghosts inside of you and like this you keep them alive. ‚ÄúPoetry and couture are things that can belong to the past,‚Äù says Piccioli, lighting a cigarette. ‚ÄúDoing this at Valentino could be very predictable. I wanted to do it in a new way so poetry could be a common language, more modern and contemporary. I like to work on something very known sometimes and give it a different conception.‚Äù He pauses, wreathed with smoke. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to get pretty. I wanted to get passionate.‚Äù  I‚Äôm painting a slightly incorrect image of Piccioli, as someone brooding and serious, intense. He‚Äôs nothing of the sort. He is, of course, serious about his work‚Äîand he does a serious, intense amount of work, showing eight collections a year for Valentino, one of fashion‚Äôs most influential and successful fashion houses. For almost a decade, he led the brand alongside Maria Grazia Chiuri; she left in 2016 to become creative director of Dior womenswear, and since then Piccioli has helmed it alone. His talent is immense, his work internationally lauded and much beloved. Specifically over the past few years, Piccioli has let rip with a series of staggering collections that showcase the breadth of his imagination, the ingenuity of the Valentino workrooms, and a passionate love both for women and for fashion as a whole. Heady are the evenings spent at the close of each Paris Couture Week in the salons of the H√¥tel Salomon de Rothschild watching Piccioli‚Äôs vision unfold.  And when you ask Piccioli about certain subjects‚Äîcouture for one, Rome being another‚Äîwhat pours forth is pure poetry. ‚ÄúRoma is very different from all other cities,‚Äù he says of the Eternal City. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a lot of layers of eras, of different experiences that changed the city. You can see Pasolini, and Catholic and Baroque angels, and you can see the paganism, which is still there. And Rossellini and Cinecitt√†, and the Fellini feeling. You can feel the loneliness of Antonioni, the kind of melancholy. But still the grandness of the empire.‚Äù But for all that lyricism and for the undeniable, blow-me-away beauty of the clothes he makes, Piccioli is also a normal guy: He‚Äôs funny, unassuming, gracious, kind. He has three tattoos‚Äîthe initials of his three children on one arm, and that of his wife, Simona, above his heart. The most recent addition is a tiger on his thigh. And he doesn‚Äôt live in Italy‚Äôs fashion capital, Milan, or even in Rome itself. He lives in Nettuno, about 40 miles south of Valentino‚Äôs creative headquarters on Piazza di Spagna. It‚Äôs the town where he was born in 1967, seven years after the founding of Maison Valentino by its fastidiously elegant namesake, Valentino Garavani, and his business partner, Giancarlo Giammetti. It was Mr. Valentino (as Garavani is known) who recruited Piccioli and Chiuri from Fendi to head the Valentino accessories team in 1999. Garavani‚Äôs dedication to fashion and particularly couture was evident from an early age: He has recalled throwing a tantrum at age six when his mother forced him to wear a bow tie he considered coarse. There are no such anecdotes, apocryphal or otherwise, about Piccioli. ‚ÄúValentino is known as a very exclusive brand of haute couture, where lifestyle is part of the dream,‚Äù says Piccioli. That‚Äôs certainly the case of the idealized lifestyle of Mr. Valentino, with multiple palazzos, ch√¢teaus, and yachts. ‚ÄúMy luxurious way of living is living outside, by the sea,‚Äù Piccioli says, smiling. ‚ÄúMy big aim is to change the perception of luxury from a certain lifestyle to a community of people who share values.‚Äù   My big aim is to change the perception of luxury from a certain lifestyle to a community of people who share values.  That‚Äôs an idea that really fascinates Piccioli, the exceptional thing being that he can work, with apparent ease, both in micro and on macro scale at Valentino. His shows make grand statements but are still embedded in the craft of fashion, a sense of the human hand, and firmly rooted in reality. ‚ÄúDaywear for me means streetwear,‚Äù he explains. ‚ÄúI think every single piece has to have its own dignity.‚Äù He‚Äôs speaking specifically of his fall ready-to-wear collection again, where the poetry‚Äîand poetic imagery‚Äîis embedded in pragmatic sports-influenced pieces like sharply cut overcoats and sweatshirts, with the same kind of elegance afforded the dreamy, drifty chiffon evening gowns in the Valentino tradition. ‚ÄúMy idea of beauty is about diversity; the idea of beauty of Mr. Valentino was a certain kind of beauty,‚Äù says Piccioli. ‚ÄúI feel that I‚Äôm not imposing a look, but I propose pieces. The difference is not to deliver an ideal woman but the idea that individuality is beauty.‚Äù  Still, Piccioli‚Äôs vision manages to cross worlds: Mr. Valentino and Giammetti are generally the first to leap to their feet to applaud his collections, often moist-eyed with paternal expressions of pride for both their children: Piccioli and the business. It‚Äôs rare that founders are so emotionally entangled with their business after they step away‚Äîand especially rare that they give it such a resounding seal of approval. It also, interestingly, evokes the words of that Montgomery piece on the Valentino runway, keeping alive the spirit of the ones you love.  Given the inevitable evolution during his decade and counting helming the post-Valentino Valentino‚Äîby Piccioli personally, both as part of a dynamic creative duo, and latterly solo, and of the world at large‚ÄîI wonder what Piccioli wants Valentino to represent today. He thinks Rodin-like. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs more about life today,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúAnd for sure that‚Äôs what I want to do, face reality. Not to escape from reality.‚Äù After our meeting I read up a bit on what Rodin‚Äôs Thinker was really thinking, what the sculpture really means. It‚Äôs a great man, lost in thought, with a powerful physique suggesting an immense capacity for action. Maybe Piccioli is more like him than I realized.

 In honor of the late fashion designer's legendary career, a look back at some of his best moments for Chanel.  Appointed to Creative Director in 1983, Karl Lagerfeld transformed Chanel into the timeless, yet boundary-pushing fashion house we know and love today. He took some of Coco Chanel's inherent styles, like the little black dress and a tweed tailored suit, and completely re-imagined them under his own brilliant vision. "A prolific creative mind with endless imagination," Chanel said in praise of the designer as news broke of his passing in Paris.

 You‚Äôll want a pair from every one.  There's no denying it, we're falling hard for jewelry designers right now. At a time when the fashion industry is in a weird state of flux (we're still waiting to see what Hedi Slimane does with C√©line), there's never been a more apt moment to turn to accessories. Jewelry in particular, is that ultimate chameleon piece. Buy a pair of statement earrings and you can wear them to work or to dinner. A necklace is both intimate and outfit-making. But if you're tired of shopping the same old bijoux, there are plenty of amazing new designers to invest in.  Statement earrings are still having a moment. If you‚Äôre looking for a pair that‚Äôs elevated and simple enough for the office, but also different to those all over your favorite shopping site, then try Alta Ora. Each piece is hand-carved in wax, and then cast in silver or brass in Brooklyn. With a background in graphic design, designer Natalia seeks to transform abstract shapes and curves into wearable objects. The name, in misspelled Portuguese, translates to ‚Äúelevated times‚Äù which represents the brand‚Äôs belief that fashion shouldn‚Äôt be fast or mass produced, but something made responsibly and worn for years to come.  To meet Annika Inez is to understand just why her label is so instantly want-able. Dressed in a jumpsuit with her blonde hair pulled into a ponytail, she is both cool Nordic girl and sophisticate. Her line, which is full of hand-blown glass and kidney-shaped fine wire earrings, is handmade in Brooklyn from recycled and ethically-sourced sterling silver and gold.  Laura Lombardi is the queen of hoops. Browse her Instagram and you‚Äôll find pic after pic of endless hoop variations (each cooler than the last). They‚Äôre affordable, look incredible, and frequently sell out before you even get a chance to browse her site. Based in Brooklyn, she grew up between New York and Italy, and constantly references the incredible style that only Italians possess in her work. These are the hoops you‚Äôre always searching for, but never seem to find.  Sometimes an earring (or a new label) catches your eye and you Can‚Äôt. Stop. Thinking. About. It. Jewelry label Leigh Miller is one of those. Her Dahli-esque earrings, necklaces, and rings, are the type that make you stop scrolling through your Instagram feed. After a career as a ready-to-wear designer, she set out to launch her own jewelry line as a one-woman team in Los Angeles. She sculpts each piece first in wax, perfecting the gorgeous organic-ness of them, then casts and hand-hammers, adding things like organic pearls and glass baubles. Consider us hooked. The hoop is maybe one of the most iconic pieces of jewelry for a reason, but when you‚Äôre sick of that shape, turn to Abel. Designer Kelsey Lim‚Äôs organically shaped earrings look a little like avocados, but the elegant, updated version you‚Äôd expect to see at a store like The Line. Based in Brooklyn, she launched her collection earlier this year, with the latest addition being a pear shaped earring with a pearl in the center. Another win for this emerging designer.  Puerto Rican-born designer Luiny Rivera is self taught, which makes her incredible designs (our favorites are the hoops and drop earrings featuring glass and wooden balls), all the more special. Inspired by her travels and current home base (New York) each piece is incredibly unique.  Some designers have a knack for making pieces that are both new and completely refreshing, yet somehow become classics in your outfit rotations. Luz Ortiz, a New York-based designer who launched her line with a collection that got everyone talking, is such a designer. From simple gold hoops to sterling silver shell-inspired studs, her architectural creations are always exciting.  There's a tipping point where cool meets unique, and Lila Rice has found it. Based in Brooklyn, NY, her double hoop earrings are unique but polished, and her overzised chain necklace is a bold statement. She also nails the combination of statement and everyday, all finished in a variety of gold and silver. For those who love simple, quietly considered jewelry that is elevated and beautiful, then Winden is a line you should invest in. Created by Becca Mapes, each piece of jewelry is made by hand in Brooklyn. The stones used in her gentle necklaces are sourced from the shores of Lake Erie, and then hand polished. Her new hair barrettes are made from sustainable acetate in France. These are the pieces designed for the individual who needs only the slightest addition to her look to feel exquisite.
 The model paid tribute to her fellow Victoria's Secret Angel on Instagram. Alessandra Ambrosio continues to say her goodbyes after walking her 17th and last Victoria's Secret Fashion Show on Monday. After posting an emotional parting message to the brand yesterday, the 36-year-old model paid a short and sweet tribute to her fellow VS Angel, Adriana Lima. Ambrosio posted a photo of her and Lima on her Instagram story last night from this year's fashion show and wrote: "It was an honor to share so many special moments on the runway with you @adrianalima! Love u üòò" Surely enough, the two have shared plenty of memorable moments on the VS catwalk together, like this sultry, black lingerie twinning moment in 2014: And this epic strut, with coordinating Fantasy Bras, in the same year: There was this adorable heart hands pose in 2011: And this runway candid in 2010: They posed for this cute backstage pic in 2006: And they even got serious during rehearsal together back in 2002: Lima walked her first Victoria's Secret Fashion Show in 1999, and Ambrosio made her debut the year after. Since then, the pair has essentially become synonymous with the lingerie brand. Though Ambrosio is hanging up her wings to focus on her swim line and pursue an acting career, Lima still plans to hit the VS runway for a couple more years. The model, who's walked 18 shows, wants to squeeze in two more before retiring. "I plan to be at 20. Two more years. Maybe more, I don‚Äôt know,‚Äù Lima told People. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nature. I‚Äôm working out, I‚Äôm being healthy, so let‚Äôs see how the body is going to turn out. But I enjoy it. So let‚Äôs say 20.‚Äù

 You can watch the whole show through Amazon Prime Video on September 20. There's a new name in lingerie and it's an already-familiar one. Rihanna usurped New York Fashion Week with her Savage x Fenty show. And Gigi Hadid is perfect evidence of it, shown here, walking down the runway in a lacy black teddy and matching over-the-knee stockings (and, for added dramatic effect, pearly Madonna tears glistening down her cheeks).  Hadid's heavenly look can be purchased through the SavageX site or Amazon once the entire collection drops on September 20.    Of course, Hadid wasn't the only supermodel working Rihanna's runway during the game-changing NYFW show. The catwalk also saw the likes of Alek Wek, Bella Hadid, Laverne Cox, Normani, Paloma Elsesser, Cara Delevingne, and Joan Smalls. Together, these models embodied one of Rihanna's core philosophies when she first started making headway into the beauty and fashion industries: that diversity and individuality deserve to be celebrated.  The exclusive show also featured ingenious musical performances by artists like Halsey, Big Sean, Tierra Whack, Migos, A$AP Ferg, DJ Khaled, and more. (Imagine Big Sean and A$AP Ferg performing a medley of "Clique" and "Bezerk" while models Cara Delevingne and Laverne Cox strut down the runway... it happened.) Sad that you missed a once-in-a-lifetime chance to catch the show? Amazon Prime Video has you covered. On September 20, the service will exclusively stream the entire show and even include some behind-the-scenes clips.   
 She brought her Oscar statue to the taping, as one casually does. Lady Gaga is undoubtedly a fashion innovator and boundary-pushing artist whose proclivity for rocking bold and cutting-edge clothing has cemented her place in the fashion industry as a genuine style star. So, it's not surprising that for last night's appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, she wore an alluring naked dress to chat with the comedian and late night show host. Her sheer, beaded, form-fitting black dress‚Äîby emerging London-based designer Khyeli‚Äîshowed off just the right amount of d√©colletage. The brand was founded by Ahmed Alkhyel, who was formally trained in architecture according to the brand's website.     Gaga's glittery number is from his Spring-Summer 2019 collection is certainly captivating and come-hither, yet very elevated, which is the aesthetic the singer has been leaning towards this awards season.  For the Oscars red carpet, she channeled style icon Audrey Hepburn during her Breakfast at Tiffany's era in a custom-made Alexander McQueen bustier dress with a full godet skirt and black gloves. The literal crown jewel of her look came from the Tiffany & Co. archives, a 128.54-carat yellow diamond necklace that usually is kept under lock and key while on display at the Fifth Avenue flagship location. For the ceremony (and her intimate performance of "Shallow" with Bradley Cooper), she wore a black Brandon Maxwell gown that's available to shop üëèright üëènow.  For the Grammys, an event known for embracing more eccentric outfits (hello, Gaga arrived to the 2011 show in an egg), she wore a glamorous silver dress from Celine by Hedi Slimane and a cool 100 carats of Tiffany & Co. diamonds on her neck and ears. When Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper sang "Shallow" on stage at the Dolby Theatre on Sunday, their performance instantly went viral, with many on social media (including actor-comedian David Spade) questioning the nature of their relationship. While on Kimmel's show, Lady Gaga made sure she took time to shut down rumors and speculation that her links to Cooper is anything more than a friendship.  ‚ÄúYou had such a connection with Bradley that, instantly, and I guess this is a compliment, people started saying, ‚ÄòOh, they must be in love,'‚Äù Jimmy Kimmel inquired.  Gaga rolled her eyes in response. ‚ÄúFirst of all, social media, quite frankly, is the toilet of the Internet. And what it has done to pop culture is abysmal. And people saw love, and guess what? That‚Äôs what we wanted you to see,‚Äù she said of their chemistry. ‚ÄúThis is a love song, ‚ÄòShallow.‚Äô The movie A Star Is Born, it‚Äôs a love story. We worked so hard, we worked all week on that performance.‚Äù

 Two iconic British fashion houses are set to join forces.  Back in March, it was announced that Riccardo Tisci would be the new Chief Creative Officer at Burberry, in a surprise move from the British fashion house. Now, in a sneak peek at what Tisci's Burberry will look like, the designer's first collaboration for the brand has been revealed‚Äîand it's with another iconic British designer: Vivienne Westwood.  Burberry and Vivienne Westwood's limited-edition collection will feature reimagined iconic styles from Burberry‚Äôs archive that celebrate British heritage and style. Proceeds from the collection will support Cool Earth, a non-profit organization working to save rainforests.  In a statement from the brand, Tisci explained the significance of the collaboration and revealed how Westwood inspired him to pursue a career in fashion design:  Westwood‚Äôs husband Andreas Kronthaler, who currently designs the main Vivienne Westwood collection, is also taking part in the design process of collaboration. He appears alongside Dame Vivienne Westwood and Riccardo Tisci in the photos announcing the special collaboration.  The Burberry x Vivienne Westwood collaboration is set to launch in December 2018, three months after Tisci's inaugural runway collection for Burberry debuts at London Fashion Week. And with the contrast between Vivienne Westwood and Burberry's take on British heritage fashion, it's sure to be a collaboration for the books.

 "I love beating the sh*t out of tires for fun." Bella Hadid breaks a sweat as a lingerie-clad, sledgehammer-toting, tire-beating workout star for Day 18 of LOVE Magazine's annual Advent Calendar. It isn't the most relatable image (unless you, too, lift hundreds of pounds of rubber in your sexy underwear), but Bella sure makes it look easy.  I mean, excuse me, we can hardly do this in our sweats and sneakers: Pehaps, for Hadid, part of her fuel is her passion for the sport. "I love beating the sh*t out of tires for fun," she says. We're not sure if we agree from experience, but hey, to each her own.  Bella goes in, whacking this unlucky tire with a sledgehammer, wearing fire engine red Agent Provocateur lingerie, black sheer thigh-high stockings, hoop earrings, and leopard print heeled sandals‚Äîwhile water rains down on her from above. Not quite your everyday workout. In real life, the athleisure fan sports actual sports bras, leggings, and sneakers when she hits the gym, but the exercise is just as intense. "I train, and I work out hard for two hours," she revealed this year. The 21-year-old is the latest model featured in the British publication's holiday video series, for this year's exercise-focused "Stay Strong" theme. Her big sister Gigi starred just last week in a "freeform" video, where she sported Tommy Hilfiger x Gigi workout gear and embraced her body hair. Days prior, Kendall Jenner starred in her own Rocky Balboa training montage, Emily Ratajkowksi writhed around in spaghetti, and Ashley Graham looked glamorous while tugging a sled by herself. Bella also starred in an exercise-themed LOVE Advent video last year, but as a sultry '80s workout instructor.  THANK YOU FOR MAKING ME THE FIRST FOR @thelovemagazine Love Advent Calendar @kegrand !!!! üòà‚ù§Ô∏èüòπ We always have the best time shooting this every year!!!!

 üò≥üò≥üò≥ Don't ask Naomi Campbell to comment on Kendall Jenner. While appearing on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen, the supermodel said a lot about the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star‚Äîby barely saying anything at all.  In their interview, Cohen asked Campbell a question from a fan on Twitter. "Peter the Meteor wants to know your views on Kendall Jenner being the highest paid model while saying she 'cherry picks her jobs' and 'could never do 30 shows in a season?'" Cohen asked.  Without hesitation, Campbell said bluntly to the camera: "Next question." (The shade is real.) To refresh your memory, the fan question refers to recent backlash against Jenner from the modeling community after a quote from her interview with Love Magazine was shared on Instagram. ‚ÄúSince the beginning we‚Äôve been super selective about what shows I would do," Jenner said in the quote. "I was never one of those girls who would do like 30 shows a season or whatever the fuck those girls do. More power to ‚Äòem. But I had a million jobs, not only catwalks but everything else. The whole combination was very overwhelming and I started to freak out a little bit and needed to take a step back."   ‚ÄúSince the beginning we‚Äôve been super selective about what shows I would do. I was never one of those girls who would do like 30 shows a season or whatever the fuck those girls do. More power to ‚Äòem. But I had a million jobs, not only catwalks but everything else. The whole combination was very overwhelming and I started to freak out a little bit and needed to take a step back,‚Äù says the 22-year-old, admitting that she ‚Äúwas on the verge of a mental breakdown.‚Äù #LOVE20
 Photographer @alasdairmclellan  Fashion Editor @kegrand  Make up @ctilburymakeup  Hair @jamesspecis  Casting @bitton  Interview #MurrayHealy A post shared by  LOVE MAGAZINE (@thelovemagazine) on Aug 17, 2018 at 1:06am PDT After the outcry from other models, Jenner tried to clarify her quote on Twitter. "It was intended to be entirely complimentary but unfortunately, my words were twisted & taken out of context. I want to be clear. The respect that I have for my peers is immeasurable!" I was misrepresented in a recent interview over the wknd & it‚Äôs important to clarify the meaning. It was intended to be entirely complimentary but unfortunately, my words were twisted & taken out of context.I want to be clear. The respect that I have for my peers is immeasurable! I get to experience first hand their tireless commitment, their work ethic, the endless days, the lack of sleep, separation from family and friends, stress of traveling, the toll on physical and mental health, yet they still make it all look effortless and beautiful. Although Campbell chose not to speak about Jenner, she did gush over her supermodel friend Cindy Crawford's daughter Kaia Gerber, who is a budding runway star. (Another fan asked if Kaia ever asks Naomi for modeling advice.) "She's adorable. I'm very proud of Kaia," Campbell said. "I sat with her and her mother at Azzedine Ala√Øa's, my late papa who's no longer here, we sat at the kitchen table and we just went through all the shows she should do or shouldn't do at the moment because, she's a baby. She'll get to them.  And she has followed everything. Very proud of her."

 A shopping experience complete with crystals and incense. Embodying the New Age doctrine is very much a niche lifestyle in New York City, in which the cacophony of honking Ubers and the indelible rage of waiting for a 20 minute delayed subway make it hard for anyone to feel their most spiritual self. Still, tapping into the bustling city's desperate need for reprieve, denim brand Mother has opened up Mystical Bazaar, a one-of-a-kind pop-up shop celebrating the brand's recent launch of its Mystical capsule collection.  New Yorkers can step inside the SoHo space, which was designed by architecture and design firm 8893, to find a series of structures inspire inspired by LA mid-century modern architecture with Japanese joinery.  In each structure, expect to find different occult experiences, from tarot to astrology readings led by Los Angeles mystics, including the astrologer and tarot card reader Natalia Benson. On the 3000 square feet main floor of the pop-up, there is an eclectic collection of handmade blankets, jewelry, baskets, vintage goods, and and even a crystal bar curated by Ellen Nguyen. The lower level space is dedicated to a "visual escape" to California's Muir Woods, in which you can participate in breath work sessions with breath work meditation guide and healer Ana Lilia.  Suffice to say, this space offers a rare opportunity to take a break from the concrete labyrinth that is New York City‚Äìand during the city's biggest annual event, New York Fashion Week, no less. Sunday is the last day to enjoy the otherworldly sensations of Mother's Mystical Bazaar. You can find the pop-up at 150 Wooster Street, North Building. The pop-up runs from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.

 Outfit ideas worth stealing, courtesy of actress-model Clara Mcgregor. There‚Äôs nothing quiet about this season‚Äôs biggest trends, especially when it comes to footwear. The range of options is larger-than-life: There are pointy mules with oversized bows, coquette-ish heels covered in animal-prints, booties in futuristic metallics, and retro-inspired sneakers with super chunky silhouettes. In short, a scene-stealing style to suit nearly every mood. But that doesn‚Äôt mean figuring out what to pair them with needs to be fraught with drama‚Äîall it takes to make it work is a playful attitude and a few simple tricks (even if you do spend hours trying on shoes at Saks' 10022 shoe floor). We tapped model and rising actress Clara McGregor to share her secrets for styling six of the season‚Äôs coolest shoes. After all, the twenty year old knows a thing or two about turning heads; thanks to her famous dad (yes, that would be Ewan) and recent roles in films such as Christopher Robin and Groove, she‚Äôs had plenty of exposure to the glamour of Hollywood.  Still, she knows how to keep it relatable and low-key, preferring to mix laid-back pieces with statement shoes. ‚ÄúI love being comfortable,‚Äù she says, but ‚Äúawesome shoes can really make an outfit.‚Äù Here are her tips on how to build an entire outfit‚Äîwith pieces that are all available at Saks‚Äîaround cool-kid sneakers, edgy booties, and more.   Pile on the Prints A mash-up of different florals can be pretty (rather than dizzying) when worn with more graphic prints. To ‚Äúkeep the look strong,‚Äù Clara recommends choosing a neutral-colored shoe with a more rigid print, like this tartan western boot. Fendi Boots, $1,490 Shop it at SAKS Don't be Afraid to Get Wild Leopard-on-leopard might sound like a lot of look to pull off, but when done right it‚Äôs surprisingly polished. The key is to mix ladylike silhouettes, like a pointy mule with an A-line dress. And be intentional when coordinating the prints; this is one situation where being matchy-matchy pays off. Gianvito Rossi Mules, $915 Shop it at SAKS Pair Playful Details with Professional Pieces A kitten heel with an over-the-top bow feels grown up when paired with business-like separates. ‚ÄúI love a great suit‚Äîsomething classy but slightly edgy with a ‚Äô70s vibe,‚Äù Clara says. ‚ÄúIf an outfit makes you feel good and empowered, then you‚Äôre never doing anything wrong.‚Äù Prada Mules, $790 Shop it at SAKS Add Interest to All Black ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing sad about all-black!‚Äù says Clara. ‚ÄúI think it can be super interesting‚Äîespecially by mixing textures and playing with shapes.‚Äù Here, patent leather booties play perfectly against a floaty lace mini dress and sheer black tights. Saint Laurent Boots, $995 Shop it at SAKS Use Tonal Shades to Tame Sparkles A glittery statement bootie can be surprisingly neutral when paired with simple separates in calming hues like grey and ivory. As Clara says, the soft palette ‚Äúkeeps the focus on the shoe without being overpowering. Miu Miu Booties, $750 Shop it at SAKS Balance Oversized Silhouettes with Chunky Kicks Extra-large shapes and major prints require a shoe of equally mega proportions. Plus, these trendy retro-inspired sneakers come with an added bonus: ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre comfortable, too,‚Äù Clara points out. Balenciaga sneakers, $895 Shop it at SAKS Styled by Coco Cassiba, Hair by Brian Buenaventura, Makeup by Mark Edio
 The brand's latest collaboration is an ode to the late street artist.  When it comes to fashion collaborations, Alice + Olivia knows how to have fun. But the brand's latest isn't just full of playful prints and color, it also pays homage to the legacy of the late Keith Haring.  The '80s street artist's most memorable works were transformed into fashion form, taking new life in a range of Alice + Olivia pieces including jackets, shoes, and the brand's signature ballgown skirts. The capsule collection, done in collaboration with the Keith Haring Foundation, features the artist's trademark dancing figures in patchwork collages and prints.  "I have always been a fan of Keith Haring's work‚Äîthe colors and graphics,‚Äù Stacey Bendet said in a statement from the brand. ‚ÄúHe was also one of the first artists to advance social causes and I think at this time in our world it's especially important to support artists who have made a difference.‚Äù Haring's artworks, which included murals, paintings, and graffiti-inspired works in urban areas, famously helped fund children's literacy projects as well as AIDS awareness initiatives. Haring himself died of AIDS in 1990 at the age of 31. In keeping with the artist's philanthropic endeavors, Alice + Olivia is adding a social aspect to the Haring collaboration as well. The brand is spreading the artist's mantra with an #ArtIsForEverbody social media campaign. To participate, Alice + Olivia is asking people to share photos of their own art‚Äîin the form of anything whether your child's artwork, your makeup routine, poetry, music, or a photo of the actual collection. For every Instagram post with the #artisforeverybody and #keithharingxAO hashtags, the brand will donate $1 (up to $25,000) to the CFDA now through November 16. Every post should also tag @aliceandolivia and @CFDA.  
 She changed everything but her jewelry.  Bella Hadid is at Cannes Film Festival right now, and as well as being spotted kissing her ex-boyfriend, The Weeknd, the model has been rocking some major outfit changes, too. Appearing yesterday on the red carpet for the Dior dinner at Cannes, Hadid wore a sheer red dress, with one strap worn off-the-shoulder. The skirt section of the dress was completely transparent, while the bodice was reinforced, so that she wasn't quite as naked as Kendall Jenner: Hadid paired the naked look with red heels, and a cute handbag: Getting ready for the night, Hadid shared several photos on Instagram, revealing that her make-up was by Dior, and her jewelry was by Bvlgari:  A few of my favorite things.... @diormakeup @bulgariofficial diamonds and @fannybourdettedonon #rockrockrock üíç A post shared by  Libragrl999ü¶ã (@bellahadid) on May 12, 2018 at 12:16pm PDT And after the Dior party, Hadid was photographed in a completely different outfit for the Le Monde Est A Toi party at the Magnum Beach. Her second look consisted of skintight, silver biker shorts, and a tiny t-shirt which revealed her midriff. She kept her Bvlgari jewelry on though, because why ruin a good thing? Basically, both of Bella Hadid's outfits were just the right amount of naked for Cannes. Hadid has been spotted hanging out with her ex, The Weeknd, on several occasions throughout Cannes so far. 
 Slay, moms! Rihanna knows how to turn a fashion show into the must-see event of the season, and she didn't disappoint with her Savage x Fenty show tonight, at the close of New York Fashion Week. RiRi featured a diverse roster of models and dancers in her stunning lingerie presentation, and among those in the mix were two expecting runway stars.  One was Slick Woods, the 22-year-old Fenty muse, who officially announced her pregnancy in July. She rocked black pasties and with a barely-there one-piece featuring cut-outs that flaunted her belly.  The look was completed with nude thigh-high socks, heels, a black headband, and thick silver hoops. Woods walked Rihanna's grassy runway like it was nobody's business.  The back of her look had some provocative cut-outs, too. Who says maternity fashion has to be covered-up and conservative?   Another expecting model was a dancer who showed off some serious moves on during the show. She wore a plunging, cream sheer one-piece accented with flowers and matching elegant, arm-length gloves.   Honestly, how did she do that? The casting resonates with Rihanna‚Äôs focus on diversity with both her beauty and lingerie brands. When Savage x Fenty first launched in May, the singer-turned-designer made sure to include women of color and plus-size women in her ads. The actual products are also available in an exceptionally wide range of sizes, from 32A to 44 DD in bras, XS to 3X in undies.  Rihanna‚Äôs agenda of inclusivity was only cemented by tonight‚Äôs presentation, which proved that people of all shapes and colors‚Äîincluding pregnant women‚Äîcan rock lingerie. And the internet couldn't be happier about it. I‚Äôm really speechless. Tonight‚Äôs show has been so fuckin brilliant. All sizes, shapes, colors and even pregnant women. She fuckin did that and has changed da game: thanks @rihanna #SavageXFenty The diversity, THE DIVERSITY! Sis had pregnant models y‚Äôall.  #SAVAGEXFW18 pic.twitter.com/5BVQ4oywTT wow #SavageXFW18 I don't think I've ever seen another lingerie collection use very visibly pregnant models before! üëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèº  This fashion show is diverse in so many different ways Familiar faces in the lineup also included Gigi and Bella Hadid, Duckie Thot, Paloma Elsesser, and more. And of course, Rihanna herself made her rounds on the runway at the end of the show. Tonight's moms-to-be weren't the only models to walk the runway pregnant this season. Over the weekend, Victoria's Secret Angel Lily Aldridge walked for Brandon Maxwell while five months pregnant.  Relive the magic of Rihanna's Savage x Fenty Fall 2018 show in the live stream below.

 Some were confused about the statement made today at Paris Fashion Week. Last season, Maria Grazia Chiuri made her debut as Dior's first female creative director with a "We Should All Be Feminists" t-shirt that took the fashion world by storm. For the fashion house's Spring 2018 show today, the designer continued her message of women's empowerment with a new theme and statement-making tee.  The show opened with a model wearing a black-and-white striped t-shirt reading, "WHY HAVE THERE BEEN NO GREAT WOMEN ARTISTS?‚Äù Initially, viewers on Twitter (and even some of those attending the actual show) were a little confused by this bold question. As blogger Bryan Boy asked on Instagram Stories, "I guess Frida Kahlo is either a man or not great...?"  But the statement in question is actually the title of a 1971 essay penned by Linda Nochlin, which explores the topic of feminist art history. The essay explores the history of women having a difficult time achieving success in the arts‚Äîa fitting statement to make in an industry that is still predominantly controlled by men at the top. Chiuri is the first-ever woman creative director in Dior's 70-year history, so the statement makes all the more sense. Show notes left on guest's seats reveal Chiuri was inspired by Nochlin's feminist theory for Spring 2018. "It is necessary to give these different and specific artists their due for it‚Äôs they who break the mold of the traditionally male discourse in art history, and in fashion," the designer wrote.  The day before the show, Dior took to Instagram to share some behind-the-scenes inspiration for Chiuri's collection, which merges both art and fashion. In one video posted, Chiuri poses the question, ‚ÄúIs there a ‚Äòfeminine art‚Äô as opposed to a ‚Äòmasculine art?‚Äô No. I don‚Äôt think so at all. There are female artists in many fields. Certainly, they‚Äôre not as numerous for reasons that have nothing to do with capability. Each story is specific to a person, it‚Äôs not specific to that person‚Äôs gender. Each woman has something to say.‚Äù   With a colorful palette, blocks of thick rainbow brushstrokes, and a debate about female artists, we bring you some of the foundations of #MariaGraziaChiuri's musings on the links between women and art informing her Spring-Summer 2018 ready-to-wear collection to be unveiled on Tuesday 26th September! #DiorSS18 #PFW A post shared by  Dior Official (@dior) on Sep 25, 2017 at 8:41am PDT Last season's "We Should All Be Feminists" t-shirt donated a portion of proceeds to Rihanna's Clara Lionel Foundation, so hopefully Dior plans to add a charitable component to its new "Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists" t-shirt as well.  In the meantime, plan to see this tee take over the street style scene.

 Plus, shop the best, of course... We are already firmly in boot season‚Äîit seems like sandal weather was just a mere few days ago. Mostly because it was. But onwards and upwards! Nothing will shake you into a new season like fashion month street style images‚Äîa place that, incidentally, serves as a treasure trove of good knee-high-boot inspiration. See how ladies we love are wearing the style, and shop some of the best.   A sculptural, oversized blazer calls for no pants and a great pair of dark red boots. These statement-makers are at their best with simple pieces like jeans or a long white dress, where they can really steal the show. We've been on board with the white boot trend for quite some time, and this lightened up approach doesn't get old. They really come alive against this burgundy leather trench. These are definite car-to-curb shoes, but we know you're fancy enough to handle that. While one might think that a girl who wears gold boots is all glam all the time, we love the juxtaposition of this statement heel paired with utilitarian basics.  We're here for a good party boot. Wear these with a black mini dress or chinos to show their inherent versatility. While certainly its own category, there's no denying that the cowboy boot is, more often than not, also a knee high boot. It has been enjoying a trend moment, but is certainly a classic. We love it with this '70s leather dress. The perfect weekend boot. Zebra just feels like the star animal print of the moment‚Äîwe love it on these slouchy boots, paired with a men's blazer and jeans.  Who doesn't love a boot that knows how to take center stage? There's also no denying the power of a snake print. Some might call you a charmer in these babies. Two-tone pieces are emerging in pants, dresses, coats, and more‚Äîso why not boots? Although this pair on Xenia are neutral shades of black and tan, they feel anything but basic.  A little bit nautical, a little bit '60s‚Äîwe'll wear this mod style with a denim pencil skirt and white blouse and be ready for the day. A wide, slouchy brown boot is utterly flattering and utterly timeless‚ÄîBettina Looney sells the trend.  This croco boot will make you look like the richest lady in town. Equestrian vibes are in its DNA but this boot is undeniably all about style.¬† Last but certainly not least, Camille proves that a great black knee high boot is forever. Paired with a bold-shouldered coat, it's all cool Parisian girl here.  File these under: keepers. You'll forget you owned another boot.¬†
 Everything to know from Chanel Couture's lavish garden party show.  From space stations to airlines to data centers, Chanel is known for its over-the-top runway sets‚Äîand today's Spring 2018 Couture show was no exception.  Staging the most lavish French garden party, Karl Lagerfeld sent his latest Chanel Couture collection down a runway of fountains, elaborate trellises, and thousands of English roses. Mirroring the theme of the set, the collection included ornate beading, feathered ensembles, floral embellished booties, and rose-topped veils accessorizing every look.  The occasion also marked Kaia Gerber's Couture Week debut, following her breakout runway season last September. The 16-year-old previously walked Chanel's Spring 2018 ready-to-wear show, but this marked her first couture show ever. For her big debut, Kaia walked the runway in a beaded and feathered blush pink dress with matching boots.  In fact, feathers, tulle, and elaborate beading took center stage at the show‚Äîmaking for a number of potential Oscars gowns this season.  Replacing last season's highly-coveted glitter boots, the Spring 2018 Couture looks were topped off with lucite-heeled boots that were adorned with intricate floral beading.  Most jaw-dropping of all, however, was the grand finale look. Accompanied by Karl Lagerfeld's 9-year-old muse Hudson Kroenig (who threw rose petals from a basket, making for the cutest flower boy moment ever), the final look featured a white suit complete with a dramatic feathered gown overlay. Making for the dreamiest of bridal looks, it was topped with a feathered headpiece and white veil.    Now that's one way to make an exit. 
 The project features 110 portrait shots of style muses and 40 paintings of royal women. "It is our tribute to beauty, eccentricity, and vanitas,‚Äù he tells BAZAAR.com of Queens: Alta Moda di Dolce & Gabbana, the design duo's recently published hardcover fashion book via Assouline Publishing.The 216-page book is filled with 100 color images and ten black and white portraits of the brand's biggest muses and friends, who were photographed by Dolce over two years. His subjects include, but not limited to Anastasia Belyak, Lori Harvey, and Azteca Henry, who are clad in ultra luxe and sophisticated pieces from Dolce&Gabbana Alta Moda and Alta Gioielleria. Snapped in the bright Baroque interiors with textured walls, gold-trimmed plush couches, and chairs, and printed carpets, each style muse wears a distinct and feminine outfit that personifies the modern-yet-classic Dolce & Gabbana woman. For example, Coco Brandolini d'Adda looks stunning posing against a burgundy chair while sporting in a black gown with tulle overlay and vibrant pink floral appliques. She's dripping in gold-tone jewelry with multicolor flares of color. The fashion book also includes 40 paintings of princesses, empresses, and noblewomen from renowned masters such as Italian painters Bronzino and Tiziano, French painter √âlisabeth Vig√©e Le Brun, and German painter Anton Raphael Mengs.Click through to preview some of the most standout photographs from Queens: Alta Moda di Dolce&Gabbana.
 A casual rainy day outfit.  Emily Ratajkowski knows how to make all of our jaws drop with a stunning nude photo. After sharing some steamy vacation pics a couple weeks ago, the model is back with another nearly-naked Instagram sure to make you do a double-take.  Sharing a behind-the-scenes look at an upcoming shoot, Ratajkowski posted a photo wearing nothing but a see-through PVC trench coat and icy blue hoop earrings. And although she's no stranger to sexy selfies, this one is still guaranteed to make you feel completely shook.    Aside from making for the perfect nearly-naked photo, the nude trench is right on-time for spring's clear PVC trend that was spotted on countless runways from Balmain to Chanel and Valentino. It would also make quite the rainy day look to combat all those April showers.  Of course, this is hardly the first time the model has posed naked (well, basically naked) on Instagram. In fact, just yesterday she shared another topless photo from the same shoot‚Äîsans the sheer trench.  And last week, she posted more topless and bikini-clad photos to promote her swimwear line, Inamorata Swim, on Instagram.  One of the behind-the-scenes photos even featured Ratajkowski's new husband, Sebastian Bear, putting "the finishing touches" on one of her looks. Ratajkowski and Bear recently tied the knot after dating for a few weeks with a surprise wedding at City Hall in New York on February 23.    So far, it seems he's taking his role as Instagram husband very seriously‚Äîwhich is understandable when you're married to the Queen of Nearly Nude Instas.

 "I could easily see teenagers and women in their 70s wearing some of these pieces." Actress Gillian Anderson is dipping a toe into the world of fashion with her first ever capsule collection with British label, Winser London. The Chicago-born actress, best known for her roles in The X-Files, The Fall and The Last King of Scotland, has teamed up with the brand to create a collection of simple, well-made staple pieces‚Äîincluding blazers, sweaters, blouses, and trousers.  Ahead of the launch, Anderson spoke to BAZAAR.com about her first experience with designing a collection, the inspiration behind the pieces, and how her bustling career has shaped her personal style. HarpersBAZAAR.com: What influences and has shaped your personal style? Gillian Anderson: I guess sometimes some of the characters I play have an influence. I know that in the last 2 years,  a character called Stella Gibson that I played on The Fall influenced me a lot. It wasn't so much that I ended up wearing silk shirts or pencil skirts or some of the things that were quintessentially her style, but I definitely feel like she influenced my sense of femininity, helped me to embrace feminine aspects of myself, so I guess that's an influence. I don't often then wear the clothes that a character has worn. So, I often find myself during the fitting saying 'this is amazing! If I were more creative or more brave, I would wear this in my personal life.' I don't often take home the clothes of a character. HB: When did you realize you wanted to make this transition and step into the fashion world?   GA: I guess it was when Winser asked me! It wasn't something that I really had an interest in getting involved in before. I have a couple of friends who are fashion designers and it just never even occured to me that  I might step in that direction. So it was really just them asking and me asking myself if I were to do this, what would I want to say through the clothes that I'd be creatively contributing? What are pieces that I might wear? What are things I don't feel like I have found myself and therefore is this an opportunity to create things that don't necessarily exist out there, or at least that I haven't been to find. That's kind of how it began.    HB: Do you think being styled on set for so many years influenced your sense of style?   GA: Possibly. For many, many years, I didn't pay any attention to it at all. I never used a stylist for events or award shows, never really paid that much attention to fashion or designers. Then in the last decade, I started with working with a man who could be considered one of the kings of  vintage clothing who sources some of the most extraordinary clothing and vintage dresses. So conversations with him about the history of fashion and starting to wear some of those clothes to events and realizing the difference between wearing something that is tailored incredibly, wearing a piece of art in essence, and not. And, the difference in how that makes you feel when you're getting a tailored suit or a suit that is cut incredibly well and how now nice it feels.  That was one of the things that was important to me in this collection‚Äîproperly paying attention to those kinds of details that I appreciate. Whether it's hidden colors, quality of the lining, double-faced material, double-faced wools, making sure the material is good and we have a clear understanding of the supply chain. And, that the majority of the materials are as local as they can be, and the quality is really good and yet still affordable.  HB: What else was important to you when designing this collection?   GA: One of the most important things for me in this was that the pieces felt multi-purpose. That pieces could be very easily dressed up or dressed down. We have a silk cotton blouse, for instance, where both the collar and the cuff could be fitted in four different ways and can look styled to be more relaxed and casual, or dressy. Both of the coats, and the tuxedo jacket, have the same feel of being relaxed and yet stylish and luxurious in a light wool fabric. The sense that the blouse or even the crewneck jumper, it's cashmere, it's fitted, could be easily worn with jeans or with dress pants. HB: What kind of woman do you see wearing this collection?    GA: Obviously, we hope that the reach is as far as possible, but I could easily see teenagers and women in their 70s wearing some of these pieces. The swing coat is ageless, the silk blouse is ageless, the trousers are ageless‚ÄîI'm hoping everybody! HB: Do you see yourself working more in fashion in the future?   GA: Initially, I felt like this was very much a one time only capsule collection. But, the process felt quite effortless and enjoyable. And I think also my struggle this summer to find a lot of casual dresses might lead me to maybe do a little dress collection. It's certainly opened my mind a bit more to different areas that we could take this. It all depends on how this first collection goes down, and kind of take it from there!

 Get ready for Tommy x Zendaya. After four seasons of Tommy x Gigi, Tommy Hilfiger is gearing up for his next design collaboration with Zendaya. Dubbed 'Tommy x Zendaya,' the duo's first see-now, buy-now collection is slated to debut on March 2 at Paris Fashion Week, WWD reports.   Earlier today, the brand teased the show location with a short video in the French capital on Instagram.   Where will #TOMMYNOW go next? Here‚Äôs a hint... #PFW‚ú® A post shared by  Tommy Hilfiger (@tommyhilfiger) on Jan 8, 2019 at 2:03am PST The Tommy x Zendaya Paris show is just the latest in the brand's series of globe-trotting runways. Most recently, Hilfiger staged its Fall 2018 collection with Lewis Hamilton in Shanghai. And for all four seasons of Hilfiger's collaboration with Gigi Hadid, the designer and model jet-setted to runways around the world including London, Milan, Los Angeles, and New York. In fact, the New York-based brand hasn't shown at New York Fashion Week since the Fall 2016 season.  The brand first announced Zendaya as its new women's ambassador and co-designer in October. Along with collaborating on the collection, the actress/singer will also star in the brand's Spring 2019 global campaign.  ‚ÄúI love to collaborate with people who are passionate about making their dreams a reality and who inspire the next generation to do the same," Tommy Hilfiger said in a statement from the brand. ‚ÄúZendaya has become a global icon, using fashion to make bold statements while always staying true to herself. Our capsule collection will fuse her eclectic style with the Americana spirit of our brand.‚Äù  Spring 2019 collection coming soon‚ú® #TommyXZendaya @tommyhilfiger A post shared by  Zendaya (@zendaya) on Oct 16, 2018 at 11:45am PDT 
 A classic timepiece is the ultimate accessory. Whatever your style, the way you wear your watch can say a lot about you. In the office or on the town, it‚Äôs vital that your timepiece not only keeps you punctual but works effortlessly with your wardrobe too.   As way of inspiration, we looked to the well-adorned wrist of jewelry designer Carolina Bucci to see how she styles her beloved Royal Oak Frosted Gold watch.  "When I'm at work, it's important that my clothes aren't overpowering, so I look for high-quality fabrics and incredible cuts," Bucci says. "My workwear style is relaxed luxury, but mainly, I let my jewelry do the talking." As the creative director of her family's jewelry dynasty, Bucci knows a thing or two about accessorizing. "I love layering, but not in a delicate or traditional way. I'm Italian and gesticulate a lot so I couldn't handle jangling jewels. I wear my gold woven and twister bracelets to bring just the right amount of glamour without them getting in the way." Considering it's the one accessory we wear every day, finding a watch that complements your workwear is key. "Audemars Piguet's Royal Oak Frosted Gold is the perfect match for my office style," says Bucci. "The brand gave me the opportunity to redesign their iconic design and I wanted to create a women's timepiece that doesn't just involve a sprinkling of diamonds and a pink strap."  With this synergy of Bucci's jewelry expertise and Audemars Piguet's watchmaking, the resulting design is understated, authoritative glamour.  For those who like to mix it up, the weekend is your time to push the fashion envelope. "I've always loved color ‚Äî the way it interacts and the emotions it provokes ‚Äî so I get experimental with my jewelry when I'm off-duty," reveals Bucci. "I wear my Forte Beads to bring just the right amount of playfulness to my look." Layering on vibrant bracelets is a great way to add an individual twist and make your watch personal to you.  "I wear a myriad of semi-precious color stone beads as they remind me of childhood days braiding friendship bracelets with my sister on Forte dei Marmi beach. It's fun to try different combinations and mix in letter beads when I want to make a statement." Elevating your look for a special occasion is easy when armed with a breathtaking timepiece and, according to Carolina, you can't go wrong with classic styles.  "My mother has always inspired my look," says Carolina. "She would wear the most beautiful gowns whether she was going to the theatre or the Opera. The family safe was in my childhood bedroom, hidden behind a painting, so she‚Äôd come in and unroll these beautiful jewels and watches. I would lie in bed, watching her getting ready." Today, Carolina embraces her Italian roots and amps up the glamour herself with floor-length dresses and a flash of yellow gold on the wrist. "I love how the Royal Oak truly shimmers thanks to my signature Florentine Finish and the smooth mirror dial reflects the world around me. It makes for a unique talking point." And one that will never go out of style. Discover the Royal Oak Frosted Gold Carolina Bucci limited edition here

 Tyra Banks, Kim Kardashian and Blake Lively have all worn this cocktail dress. Meghan Markle has certainly shown us she has a penchant for both high and low fashion, whether it's a Ralph & Russo couture dress for her engagement photos, or her favorite Aritzia trench coat for a sporting event. Just this week Markle has demonstrated how life is all about that high/low balance and you don't ever have to compromise on style. The royal-in-training stepped out on Tuesday in a chic Altuzarra runway dress for a royal engagement alongside Prince Harry. The spring dress is in stores and  retails for about $1,995.  However, last night Markle attended a women's empowerment event in an equally stylish sheath by Black Halo which you can buy right now for $395. She paired the dress with ankle-strap pumps and a luxe patent Gucci clutch that retails for $895. There's a good chance that this dress might look a bit familiar to you, as this dress has been around for more than a decade! Blake Lively first wore it in white back in 2006 at the CW Upfront event when she was acting on Gossip Girl. Tyra Banks has worn the dress in more than one color at various events. Even Kim Kardashian has rocked this Jackie-O namesake dress. It's ability to flatter many different shapes and sizes clearly has made it a celebrity go-to, as well as its timeless silhouette. The dress is currently available in black, blue and red, $375, saks.com. SHOP Want more royals? Now you can watch all of the best episodes from Bazaar's Royal Watch‚Äîright here on Prime Video.
 The model channeled the former First Lady's infamous pink coat.  From fashion editorials to posing fully nude, Emily Ratajkowski knows how to turn heads with a stunning photoshoot. Her latest, however, shows the model like we've never seen before: as the late Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.  While on the streets of New York, EmRata was seen being photographed as the former First Lady for an upcoming shoot. In the images, the model wears an oversized pastel pink coat seemingly referencing the infamous pink tweed suit Jackie Kennedy wore when President Kennedy was assassinated in 1963. And she surprisingly looks just like a modern-day version of Jackie. Though she didn't wear a matching pillbox hat, the model sported the same '60s hairstyle as the late style icon. Furthering the retro-inspiration, she wore black winged eyeliner and nude lipstick for the photos. The former First Lady's style has been repeatedly channeled in fashion as of late. Last season, Moschino sent a lineup of alien-inspired Jacqueline Kennedy clones down the runway at Milan Fashion Week. Joan Smalls, Gigi Hadid, Kaia Gerber, and Bella Hadid were amongst the models transformed into the late Jackie O at the show. 
  While it's unclear who Emily Ratajkowski was doing the '60s-inspired shoot for, she was photographed alongside model Jordan Barrett. If you excuse us, we'll be patiently awaiting the final photo outcome.

 From flip flops to bucket hats.   This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. SKIMS is finally here. After months of teasing and a brief rebranding stint, Kim Kardashian West launched her long-awaited shapewear and undergarment line yesterday, which has reportedly already made millions.  The new line brings "solutionwear," or body-enhancing undergarments, to the forefront of the sartorial limelight. SKIMS makes use of the latest shaping techniques, from heavy bonded materials that smooth and flatter to a compression method that automatically cinches the wearer's waist, to universally accommodate all body sizes. "I rely on solutionwear to accentuate and enhance my body, shape, and silhouette," Kardashian West said in a statement. "As my style changed and evolved, I found myself altering existing shapewear to work specifically for each look that I was going for. I knew I wasn't alone in looking for the perfect shapewear and was inspired to turn my passion into something real that works for every body type." SKIMS garments fall under six categories: Seamless Sculpt, Core Control, Sheer Sculpt, Contour Bonded, Fits Everybody, and Mesh Intimates. Sizes range from XXS to 4X, and up to 5X in shapewear. You can also mix and match with nine color availabilities: sand, mica, clay, ochre, sienna, umber, oxide, cocoa, and onyx. HarpersBAZAAR.com also spoke to the SKIMS founder about her thoughts on all of today's raging fashion trends, in an exclusive episode we called Kim's Kourt. There, she weighed in on everything from exposed thong straps to the color pistachio green. What got the KKW stamp of approval? You'll have to watch the video to find out.
 A look back at all the standouts.  Now that the Spring 2020 runways have officially come to an end, we're taking a look back at the top collections that will define next season. From Loewe‚Äôs artisanal craftsmanship to Dries Van Noten‚Äôs ‚Äò80s-inspired maximalism to some newcomers to take note of‚Äîthere‚Äôs a lot to get excited about come Spring. For the love of fashion:  The beauty is in the details:  Sarah‚Äôs collections are always the perfect mix of artisanal materials and sharp tailoring. This season she used linen from the oldest mill in Ireland and upcycled tulle, organza, and lace from previous collections.  The standout look: Sarah never does anything by half measures, and her approach to collaboration is no exception. She invited each and every McQueen employee to help embroider sketches‚Äîwhich were created by Central Saint Martins MA students during a life drawing class‚Äîonto this tulle gown worn by Stella Tennant.

 It's confusing, but Versace isn't over. You're probably not totally clear on this whole "Michael Kors now owns Versace" thing. Yes, the most successful all-American brand in the current market is now the proud owner of one of the most preeminent names in Italian fashion. It's mind-bending, truly. But Versace is still Versace. Let me explain. After rumors of the acquisition, Michael Kors Holdings officially confirmed its purchase of Versace for $2.12 billion. In its acquisition of the brand, Michael Kors Holdings will now officially be named Capri Holdings. As BAZAAR.com reported earlier today, "The Versace family will become shareholders of Capri Holdings Limited, with Donatella keeping her role as creative director of the fashion house. Capri Holdings, formerly Michael Kors Holdings, now has three major fashion houses under its portfolio: Michael Kors Collection, Jimmy Choo, and Versace." Michael Kors Holdings acquired Jimmy Choo last year, setting itself apart from other fashion conglomerates that tend to grow in scale and revenue strictly via licenses, diffusion lines, and the acquisition of more mass-market labels. John D. Idol, CEO of Michael Kors Holdings Limited, said in a release: "The acquisition of Versace is an important milestone for our group...We believe that the strength of the Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo brands, and the acquisition of Versace, position us to deliver multiple years of revenue and earnings growth."  Here's where the confusion lies. Fans of the iconic Italian brand, which became beloved stateside when Gianni Versace moved into the Versace Mansion and changed the face of American style in the late '80s and '90s, are terrified of what's to come due to Kors' influence on the brand. Michael Kors is known for easy, breezy, American style‚Äìnot the sexy, risk-taking, ultra-luxe Italian allure upon which Versace is based. Furthermore, Kors' success is based upon his licensing and diffusion brands, like Michael Michael Kors, as well as his fragrance, timepieces, and accessories partnerships. It seems fans are worried this kind of market saturation could be next for Versace, which currenly only has one sister line, Versus Versace, to its name. imagine seeing Versace in Marshalls or Ross lol i would throw up But similar to Jimmy Choo's agreement with Kors Holdings, Donatella Versace will continue to remain at the helm of her namesake brand, leading the brand's creative vision. Said Versace of the news, "This is a very exciting moment for Versace. It has been more than 20 years since I took over the company along with my brother Santo and daughter Allegra.  I am proud that Versace remains very strong in both fashion and modern culture. Versace is not only synonymous with its iconic and unmistakable style, but with being inclusive and embracing of diversity, as well as empowering people to express themselves. Santo, Allegra and I recognize that this next step will allow Versace to reach its full potential." Understandably, this means that scaling the Versace name into new avenues of revenue is a possibility‚Äìbut that likely won't include mass-retailers in the way Kors has expanded his ever-growing empire‚Äîat least not immediately. It seems that Kors, now Capri Holdings Limited, is eager to expand predominantly into the luxury space, and much will be revealed when details of the acquisition are finalized and released. While Donatella's loyal fanbase might not be as welcome to change, she certainly seems to be excited for what the future may bring under Idol and the Capri's collaboration and leadership. "We believe that being part of this group is essential to Versace‚Äôs long-term success," Donatella said. "My passion has never been stronger. This is the perfect time for our company, which puts creativity and innovation at the core of all of its actions, to grow.‚Äù

 We see you, Barney. By all accounts, it's been a rough year to be an American‚Äîespecially an American woman. It's all sorts of chaotic out there in ways I don't need to enumerate here‚Äîbut for the sake of argument, here are some buzz words for you: Trump, wild fires, Weinstein, hurricanes, Roy Moore, net neutrality (or lack thereof), the death of the middle class, et al. And now, to top it all off, Pantone has deemed ultra violet the official hue of 2018. It's a color that calls to mind very annoying dinosaurs, shades of certain cruciferous vegetables, and even the late Prince. But it's not exactly an ideal shade for a grown woman to weave into her wardrobe‚Äîunless of course you are one of those sassy octogenarians who favor purple hats. Leatrice Eiseman, executive director of the Pantone Color Institute told the New York Times, ‚ÄúWe wanted to pick something that brings hope and an uplifting message.‚Äù I see the traffic numbers for Harper's BAZAAR.com, I know that Americans are obsessed with the British Monarchy right now‚Äîwho wouldn't take Kate and Meghan over Melania and Ivanka?‚Äîbut that doesn't necessarily mean that the color of royalty should reign.  Lest I overstep my bounds, if the final shade on the spectrum is of current interest, may we recommend a flattering hue of lavender as an alternative. Designers from Tom Ford to Michael Kors championed this pretty pastel for Spring 2018‚Äîit's both subtle and not as terrifying as ultra violet. We need something to look forward to, after all‚Äîother than more taxes.

 From Chlo√© and Fendi, to Stella McCartney and Little Marc Jacobs. Wedding season is upon us once again, and while the festivities and celebrations usually make for great memories, they often come at a cost to parents. It's just something of a bummer to spend a lot of money on special-occasion clothing for kids, knowing that they'll probably outgrow whatever you bought for them by the time the next wedding rolls around. Enter Rent the Runway, ready to help. Starting April 15, the popular clothing-rental company will expand to include a children's line. That means no more shelling out for expensive flower-girl dresses they'll only use once. Instead, you can rent a frock from a high-end designer that you'd never dream of purchasing because of how little financial sense it would make. And then, at the end of the weekend, you can just send it back for the next kid to wear, eliminating the guilt that comes with a beautiful (and pricey) garment gathering dust in the back of a closet.  The service will initially offer only girls' clothes in sizes 3Y to 12Y. The launch also comes with a pretty heavy-hitting lineup of 13 designers: Chlo√©, Fendi, Stella McCartney, Little Marc Jacobs, Marni, Philosophy, Milly Minis, LoveShackFancy Kids, and more.  The kids' clothing rentals will come as an extension of their current monthly subscription services: Reserve (four- to eight-day rentals) and Unlimited (a monthly subscription service). Members can start adding kids' clothes to their order, so if you have a big event coming up, you can coordinate with your little one and rent everything in one go. And, with dresses this cute, why wouldn't you?

 This is such a different look for Goldie Hawn's daughter. Kate Hudson has undergone quite the style transformation for her latest movie role. Stepping out in New York on Friday night, Hudson not only showed off her shaved head, she also wore a very revealing jumpsuit.

Hudson wore the cut-out jumpsuit on a date with her boyfriend Danny Fujikawa, while attending an event for her new movie, Marshall. She finished the outfit with a leopard print clutch, and a bright red, sleeveless coat.

 "It was no doubt one of the hardest moments I have ever had to go through in my career." Victoria's Secret model Ming Xi became an unexpected focal point of the fashion show in Shanghai when she tripped and fell on the runway during the official taping yesterday. Despite the unexpected tumble, she kept a smile on her face and the crowd cheered her on. Her fellow model Gizele Oliveira helped her up to her feet, and she finished her walk like a pro.  Xi, who's walked for Victoria's Secret since 2013, responded to her runway blunder in an Instagram post late last night. Though she kept a smile on through the show, the model divulged in how hard the fall was for her, especially in her native city of Shanghai.  "It was no doubt one of the hardest moments I have ever had to go through in my career, especially since the show was taking place in my hometown, in front of my mother's and my people's eyes," she wrote. "However, the support I received from everyone yesterday was incredible and I am truly grateful to everyone who was there for me."  She especially acknowledged Oliveira for her help on the catwalk. "Thank you for helping me up after the fall, it was a very selfless and loving act from you," the model added. Xi revealed that Oliveira wasn't the only model who offered support; others also consoled her backstage. "Thank you to all the girls who rushed to comfort me at backstage after what had happened, you are all family to me," she said. She also thanked everyone who sent her supportive messages.  The 28-year-old model ended on a positive note: "I will pick myself up from where I fell, and I will keep going in order to repay all the support you all have given me!!" Read her full post below:  As many of you may already know, I fell during my 5th year walking at the Victoria's Secret show yesterday. It was no doubt one of the hardest moments I have ever had to go through in my career, especially since the show was taking place in my hometown, in front of my mother's and my people's eyes. However, the support I received from everyone yesterday was incredible and I am truly grateful to everyone who was there for me. @ed_razek Thank you for your supportive words and your continuous support throughout these 7 years. @giizeleoliveira Thank you for helping me up after the fall, it was a very selfless and loving act from you. Thank you to all the girls who rushed to comfort me at backstage after what had happened, you are all family to me. Lastly thank you to everyone who sent and left me supportive messages. I will pick myself up from where I fell, and I will keep going in order to repay all the support you all have given me!! ‚ù§Ô∏èÔ∏è#vsfashionshow @victoriassecret A post shared by  Ming Xi (@mingxi11) on Nov 20, 2017 at 8:24pm PST Xi's Instagram post follows a shorter message she posted on Weibo earlier yesterday. "I'm sorry to let everyone down. Thanks for everyone's concern," she wrote. "As a model for seven years, I have fallen on this road many times, but I know no matter how painful it is, I must stand and finish. The future road is long. I will always continue walking."

 The Spring 2019 runways featured 44.8% models of color.  Although the Spring 2019 collections may still be underway at Paris Fashion Week, The Fashion Spot just released its official diversity report from New York Fashion Week's Spring 2019 shows‚Äîand there's some noteworthy progress to highlight.   In terms of race, size, age, and gender, this season was the most diverse yet for the New York shows. There were obvious standouts during the week, like Pyer Moss' show that celebrated African American culture while casting all black models and Rihanna's Savage x Fenty show that featured incredibly inclusive casting with women of all sizes and races in lingerie (along with two pregnant models). And designers like Chromat, Christian Siriano, and Prabal Gurung once again led the way with some of the most diverse shows of the week.  The Fashion Spot found that nearly a quarter of all shows included more models of color than white models. As a whole, models of color made up 44.8 percent of the runways‚Äîwhich is up from 37.3 percent last season.  Designers who cast the most racially inclusive shows this season include Pyer Moss (100 percent models of color), Claudia Li (100 percent models of color), Chromat (91.7 percent models of color), LaQuan Smith (76.5 percent models of color), Gypsy Sport (76 percent models of color), Prabal Gurung (75.6 percent models of color), Savage x Fenty (71.7 percent models of color), and Christian Cowan (71.4 percent models of color).  This season also saw an improvement in terms of size inclusivity (though still not nearly enough). A total of 49 plus-size models walked in 12 different shows, compared to last season's 27 in eight shows.  Once again, Chromat led the way casting 13 plus-size women in its Spring 2019 show. The brand also made a powerful statement by sending models of all sizes down the runway wearing T-shirts that read 'Sample Size.' Other standouts in plus casting this season included Christian Siriano (who has always been a champion for size inclusivity on the runway) and Savage x Fenty.  Despite the fact that this season included more models over the age of 50 than ever before, it's still the category with the least representation‚Äîby a drastic amount. Out of 76 major shows, New York only had 12 over-50 models walk for the entire Spring 2019 season, which accounts for not even 1 percent.   Sies Marjan, Chromat, Tome, Polo Ralph Lauren, and Zero + Maria Cornejo each cast two over-50 models, while Calvin Klein and Collina Strada each had one. Though the number was up from last season (which only included nine over-50 castings), there's still quite some work to do in terms of age inclusivity.  This season also saw an improvement in gender inclusivity. Transgender women and non-binary models made a total of 53 runway appearances at 20 different shows, a notable increase from last season's 33 castings (and the Spring 2018 season's 31 castings). Another interesting thing to note from New York's Spring 2019 season was the increased casting of drag queens. Opening Ceremony, Gypsy Sport, and The Blonds all cast a total of 25 drag performers. Taking that notion a step further, Opening Ceremony's show was formatted entirely as a drag show hosted by RuPaul‚Äôs Drag Race winner Sasha Velour. The runway was cast with all LGBTQIA+ models, 21 of whom were drag queens. Read the full New York Fashion Week Spring 2019 diversity report at TheFashionSpot.com. 
 The model revealed there was a dress emergency on KUWTK On the latest episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, the second youngest of the Kardashian-Jenner clan, supermodel Kendall, revealed that she had an epic fashion fail that we had no idea happened. In the episode, which was filmed last September during the Spring 2018 New York Fashion Week, the 22 year-old announced that she was very close to be wearing not much at all at a major fashion event. The California girl was in the east coast city with her mother, Kris Jenner, her sister's baby daddy Scott Disick and older sister Kim Kardashian for fashion week.    While her family where there to sit front row and attend fabulous parties, she was there to strut down endless runways and pick up her prestigious Fashion Icon of the Decade award at The Daily Front Row's Fashion Media Awards. You may remember that there was some controversy over Jenner receiving the award, since her breakout seasons only occured in 2014 and 2015, meaning she's had a relatively short career.   On the night the Victoria's Secret model wore an unreal, one-shouldered, tulle Giambattista Valli black gown, similar to the one she wore to the Golden Globes this year. Complete with Lorraine Shwartz jewelry and a bold lip, Jenner looked to-die for when she picked up her award. However, in the KUWTK episode, Kendall arrives at the Four Seasons Hotel green room to see her family and says, "my dress broke. The whole zipper came undone, so Marni sewed me in." Marni is Jenner's trusty stylist who works with the likes of Beyonc√© and was thankfully on-hand to avoid a disaster. There's even video evidence of the model being sewn in on the night on Kendall's Instagram. Somehow we totally missed it:   Marni to the rescue A post shared by  Kendall (@kendalljenner) on Sep 15, 2017 at 10:59am PDT  Kris seemed wholly unconcerned with her daughter's problem, replying: "Oh! I love it‚Ä¶fashion emergency!" Ever the sympathetic mom.

 American Express‚Äôs Janey Whiteside walks us through her wardrobe. Every day is completely different. I manage a global team of around 250 between our headquarters in New York, our London offices, and people all over the United States and the world. My official title is executive vice president and general manager of global charge products, benefits, and services at American Express. I run our global charge card business, which is responsible for all card-member benefits and services like our loyalty programs, airport lounges, and benefits in the dining, entertainment, and events space, as well as our partnerships. I travel internationally at least once a month, usually to London, but I‚Äôve also been to Hong Kong and Singapore this year. Typically I‚Äôll take a red-eye and be back in a few days. I‚Äôm also on the board of the American Red Cross, so I might have a commitment with them, a speaking engagement, or a meeting with advisers and collaborators from Amex‚Äôs Platinum Collective advisory board. Thankfully I‚Äôm a morning person. I wake up around 6 , check my e-mails‚Äîthere are anywhere from 20 to 40‚Äîand make a cup of coffee. Then I wake the kids; my husband and I have two boys, ages eight and 10. After that the usual stuff begins: making breakfast, taking a shower, getting the kids ready for school, and ensuring that they have their swim kits in their backpacks. The office is not at all corporate when it comes to style. I have a passion for fashion, and when you work in the corporate world it‚Äôs one of the ways you can express yourself. I rely on Net-a-Porter.com and Matches, and I‚Äôm constantly looking at things. I love Prada, Miu Miu, and Altuzarra for my work wardrobe, and Nili Lotan for the weekend. I usually have a fair idea of what I‚Äôm wearing the night before, but I double-check in the morning. If I‚Äôve got an important meeting internally or with a partner or agency, I‚Äôll wear a dress and heels. I‚Äôm definitely a shoe girl. I‚Äôm a big fan of Aquazurra heels, especially colored ones, and I have a huge collection of red heels. At the moment I‚Äôm obsessed with my Gucci slides. If it‚Äôs a typical day, my uniform is jeans, T-shirt, and a jacket. On Fridays, it‚Äôs jeans and sneakers. I love the frayed-denim look right now. I have a big collection of Golden Goose sneakers. We live in New York‚Äôs Tribeca, and the boys get the bus right outside our building at 7:30 , so I see them off and walk to the office, which is in the World Financial Center. I pick up a coffee and yogurt or an energy bar on the way to eat when I get in. I don‚Äôt have another coffee after that, just tea. I‚Äôm British, after all. Occasionally I‚Äôll have some weird herbal tea if I‚Äôm trying to be good, but mostly it‚Äôs Yorkshire Gold English tea with milk. And I drink a lot of water during the day. I spend the first 10 minutes at my desk with my assistant going through the diary and reviewing all the documents I need for the day. My first meeting is usually at 8  and quite often that will be a telepresentation with the London team, which could take 90 minutes. We‚Äôll discuss a card- member benefit we‚Äôre introducing, a new product we‚Äôre launching in a certain country, or upcoming events and membership experiences. Some meetings are more motivational than others. I love meeting with the team and hearing different perspectives. I also try to book half an hour in the morning and in the afternoon to catch up on calls and e-mails. Some days I might leave the office to attend a partner lunch or have lunch with a client or my team nearby at Spring Place in Tribeca. Once a week I‚Äôll eat at my desk, usually chicken and salad, something along those lines. I never have wine at lunch‚ÄîI wish! The middle of the afternoon is a really low period, and that‚Äôs when the tea bags come out. I try not to succumb to chocolate, but it‚Äôs hard, as there‚Äôs a lot of chocolate around the office. I attend evening events once or twice a week, and always make sure I have direct interactions with our customers. It‚Äôs important to hear their feedback on our services. We‚Äôve had some great events in the past. Around Christmas last year we did a private dinner, and Bruno Mars performed, which was spectacular. ‚ÄúTrying to balance work, family, and self is a constant challenge. There‚Äôs usually one that you feel you‚Äôre neglecting.‚Äù The chance of getting out of the office at 5  is slim, but I try to make it to a 5:30 or 6:30 SoulCycle class three times a week. I used to do more yoga, but by the time you get to the studio and spend 90 minutes in class it‚Äôs been two and a half hours, and I just don‚Äôt have the time. I‚Äôve been doing Soul- Cycle for about three years. With the right class, you come out feeling physically and emotionally fantastic, and it‚Äôs quick.  By the time I get home from SoulCycle, the kids are showered and finishing up their homework. They like me to make their dinner, so I do that and talk to them for a bit, then they go off and read or play Lego. After that I‚Äôll make dinner for my husband and me. I love to cook, but during the week it will be something easy, usually a chicken dish or salmon. I shower and unwind with a glass of white wine and maybe some fun pop music like Justin Timberlake or a bit of Bruno Mars. Then I‚Äôll watch Netflix or a reality-TV show on Bravo. I love House of Cards, and my husband and I love watching foreign TV series‚Äîwe search them out. We‚Äôve been watching this great French series called Spin. But I won‚Äôt lie; I do love me some Real Housewives.  I might read in bed for a bit and look at my favorite blogs. I‚Äôll also do a last check of my e-mails at 9:30, and then not again until the morning, unless there‚Äôs something urgent going on. I have a curated selection of news on my iPad, so I‚Äôll surf that and look at The Guardian to catch up on the news in the U.K. Reading is more of a vacation thing these days, but I do look at a lot of magazines. I love interior magazines, and I read Harper's Bazaar, obviously. Lights out is between 10 and 11  I‚Äôm a pretty good sleeper. I joined American Express 20 years ago this December, which sounds horrific. I started in the London office and moved to New York around 9/11. I love everything about the city‚Äîit‚Äôs so cosmopolitan. Compared with London, New York is very set up for city living. I also love my team, our customers, and what I do, but trying to balance work, family, and self is a constant challenge. There‚Äôs usually one that you feel you‚Äôre neglecting, but I‚Äôve learned that you have to give yourself the freedom to be okay with that. Oddly enough, I think having kids is the most empowering thing to allow that to happen, because you know where your priorities lie. The other thing I say to everybody is, no matter what advice you get and where you are, you need to stay authentic to yourself or you will never be successful or happy. ‚ÄúThe office is not at all corporate when it comes to style. I have a passion for fashion, and when you work in the corporate world it‚Äôs one of the ways you can express yourself.‚Äù I‚Äôve been extremely lucky because at no point in my time at American Express has my being a woman entered into any decision around my career‚Äîthere is no notion of gender inequality here. I‚Äôve always felt very welcomed and at home. And after this long, some of my best friends are work colleagues. It‚Äôs like family now.

 ‚ÄúI made this item you are going to buy, but I didn‚Äôt get paid for it.‚Äù ISTANBUL (AP) ‚Äî Shoppers at the fashion retailer Zara in Istanbul have found unusual tags on their garments ‚Äî complaints by Turkish workers who say they have not been paid for the merchandise in the store. Workers from an outsourced manufacturer for Zara and other retailers have been going into Zara shops and leaving the tags inside clothes. The tag reads "I made this item you are going to buy, but I didn't get paid for it." It urges shoppers to back their campaign and pressure Zara into paying them. The tags say the workers were employed by Bravo, which closed down overnight. Workers say the manufacturer owes them three months of pay as well as severance allowance. Inditex, which owns Zara, did not immediately respond to questions from The Associated Press.
 It's 1993 all over again... Stuart Weitzman is celebrating the 25th anniversary of its most iconic and well-loved style, the 5050 boot. In its 25-year existence, the 5050 over-the-knee boot has garnered a cult following, worn by '90s It girls and current Insta stars alike. Currently, ladies like Gigi Hadid (the face of Stuart Weitzman's most recent ad campaign), Angelina Jolie, Jessica Alba, Olivia Palermo and Selena Gomez have embraced the up-to-there boot. What makes the Stuart Weitzman 5050 design different from other over-the-knee styles is the unique, universally-flattering stretch construction‚Äîcrafted using a Stuart Weitzman pioneered dual-sided back-stretch technology. Due to its rapid popularity, the 5050 category has expanded in its 25 years to include a range of heel heights and colors.   Angels @romeestrijd + @josephineskriver wear the #HILINE boots out and about in Shanghai. #StuartWeitzman A post shared by  STUART WEITZMAN (@stuartweitzman) on Dec 6, 2017 at 7:13am PST The standout style getting a hat tip in a Kate Moss-fronted campaign though is the Reserve, shown in signature stretch-back with a 1 ¬æ-inch block heel. We can't think of a better model to celebrate a quarter century of stellar sales than someone whose career has gone equally strong during the same tenure. 
 This is the comeback the department store's been looking for.  Tracee Ellis Ross is bringing JCPenney back. The Blackish actress teamed up with the department store for a limited-edition holiday capsule collection that's both accessible and inclusive for all budgets and body types. Though Ross has always loved fashion, this marks her first foray into design.  The 45-piece collection‚Äîwhich includes women's apparel, accessories, and home decor‚Äîranges in price from $9 - $75 and sizes small to 3X. According to the first looks shared by Ross on Instagram, the collection includes an array of pieces like black tuxedo suits, velvet dresses, sequin dresses, and a major red robe coat that we all need.  In an interview with WWD, Ross explained the importance of designing a collection that catered to all women. "Feeling great and looking great should be accessible to everyone and should be affordable," she said. "It doesn‚Äôt have to cost a lot to look incredible. It was very important to me to have considered a diverse group of women.‚Äù  JCPenney doesn't typically collaborate with celebrities on collections, but they've been inching towards a fashion-forward revamp for quite some time now. In the past year, the store has debuted a Project Runway partnership and amped up its Sephora in-shop stores. But with Ross' star power and a capsule collection that's equal parts chic and affordable, this may just be the fashionable comeback the store has been searching for all along.  Ross's collection will be available at all JCPenney‚Äôs stores and on jcpenney.com beginning November 12.
 At 80 years old, the iconic beauty stars in a new campaign for the brand and reveals how her first ad for Chanel changed her life.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. Fifty-four years after she made her debut as the face of Chanel No. 5 fragrance, Ali MacGraw returns to the storied French house to star in a campaign for Chanel's J12 watch collection. In a black and white video helmed by French creative Brigitte Lacombe, the 80-year-old model and actress gets candid in-front of the camera. In less than 60 seconds, MacGraw touches on life in the '60s and '70s and the most defining moment of her career.  "Obviously, a watch is to tell time if you're obsessed with time. But, I've always thought of it as special jewelry," she says while looking down at her white watch from Chanel's J12 collection. Keeping the look timeless, she wears a white button-down shirt and her hair pulled back in a ponytail.   MacGraw also reflects on her youth and what it was like coming of age during the counterculture movement. "I had this major moment like anyone my age did in the '60s and the '70s when music was extraordinary and when almost suddenly we were able to live with optimism and freedom. We could do whatever we wanted to," she says of the rebellious era.  And as for what MacGraw would do if time were no longer an issue? "That's a long list." When asked about her career-defining moment, MacGraw throws it back to her time as a model, when her girl next door look helped to push a bare-faced and low-maintenance beauty standard. "When I was asked to do an ad for Chanel No. 5. An agent saw that picture in a drugstore somewhere in New York and asked me if I would like to be in the movies, for which I had no qualifications. I guess the rest is history," she adds with a smile. Along with MacGraw, Chanel also tapped eight other women including supermodels Naomi Campbell and Claudia Schiffer, along with the longtime face of the brand Keira Knightley and Lily-Rose Depp, to star in the new campaign.

 The new 20-year-old face of Chanel and Versace is a blue-jean baby  Having daring style means dressing however you wish, fearlessly pushing the limits, and not caring who is watching. The most helpful piece of style advice I‚Äôve been given is that self-confidence is the best outfit.   My personal style icons are Anita Pallenberg, Faye Dunaway, and Lauren Hutton. But the woman in my life who has most influenced my style is my mom. Sometimes she still picks out my outfits!  I‚Äôm so happy that the trends of the ‚Äô70s‚Äîthe decade my soul was really born‚Äîare coming back around in full swing. I think heavily drawn-on eyebrows need to stop.  I would describe my fashion choices as chic, confident, rock ‚Äôn‚Äô roll, realistic, and bold. My go-to look is a cool jacket (I‚Äôm a big Levi‚Äôs fan), a Chanel scarf, a vintage Grateful Dead T-shirt, high-waisted Re/Done jeans, and Saint Laurent booties.   A Louis Vuitton 18th-century-style frock coat is at the top of my spring wish list. I also have my eye on the perfect white-and-pink minidress from Chanel.  My playlist consists mainly of ‚Äô70s rock and ‚Äô90s hip-hop. My album of the moment is Fleetwood Mac‚Äôs from 1975.   For Mother‚Äôs Day a couple of years ago, I put sticky notes with lyrics from my mom‚Äôs and my favorite song throughout a hotel room. I also left a cake on the table for when she arrived from the airport. Unfortunately I dropped it, so instead of saying ‚ÄúHappy Mothers Day,‚Äù it just said, ‚ÄúHappy Day.‚Äù Whatever works!  The best gift I‚Äôve ever received is a Roomba, the robot vacuum. I‚Äôm not home very often these days, but I like a clean apartment. Luckily I can control it from anywhere with an app on my phone.  Salvador Dal√≠ is my favorite artist. His paintings always evoke a solid, distinctive emotion.    My most treasured possession is a compass necklace. When I started traveling my mom gave it to me so I could always find my way back home.   My favorite place I‚Äôve been for work is Mykonos, Greece. The food is incredible, the water is hypnotizing, and the people are so sweet! One day on set, the photographer had invited two elderly fishermen and one of their wives to join us. They played traditional bagpipes, she sang, and the whole crew danced.  I always travel with pawpaw cream. I also swear by Est√©e Lauder Advanced Night Repair serum and Diptyque‚Äôs Baies candle.  Having grown up in the Florida Panhandle, I‚Äôm very active. My bucket list includes skydiving in Waialua, Hawaii; scuba diving at the Yongala shipwreck in Australia; rock climbing in Boulder Canyon in Colorado; and swimming alongside sharks in Maaya Thila, Maldives.   My style hasn‚Äôt really changed over time. I just now know how to mix and match the old with the new. 
 Is this camp? We take shoulder pads for the test drive in Whole Foods to find out. I wasn‚Äôt alive in the ‚Äò80s and growing up, I always felt extremely blessed to have missed out on all the shoulder pads, poufy dresses, and giant Aqua Net-filled perms I made fun of in old family photos of my mom and aunts.  It was the decade I‚Äôd turn to for every thematic dress-up day at school because it was so over-the-top and something I‚Äôd never, ever wear in real life. But then something slowly began to happen: Puff-sleeved dresses started popping up on the runways, Hedi Slimane turned Saint Laurent into an Eighties dance party, and I discovered the icon that was Joan Collins as Alexis Carrington Colby while falling into a hole of old Dynasty episodes. Suddenly, I wanted to dress exactly like the people I used to make fun of in retro photos because, FASHUN!   Puff-sleeved tops and dresses, strong-shouldered power suits, and even bike shorts have all staged comebacks in the last few seasons‚Äîfrom the runway to just about every influencer on Instagram. But instead of dying down, the ‚Äò80s revival only seems to be revving up to more extreme heights, with shoulder pads becoming more prominent and puffed party dresses turning into daywear. And in the spirit of this year‚Äôs Met Costume Exhibition, one has to wonder: Is it camp? The exaggerated theme of the Met Gala red carpet and coinciding exhibit is a reminder that fashion is often at its best when it doesn‚Äôt take itself too seriously. Similarly, the return of the ‚Äò80s‚Äîan era which undoubtedly took itself entirely too seriously‚Äîfeels a bit tongue-in-cheek and maybe even ironic this time around.   #makeitrotate @thora_valdimars wearing Style 1 ‚Äì Pink Jacquard & @_jeanettemadsen_ in Style 5 ‚Äì Pink Wrap Dress, Collection 1. Shot by @themisspopo A post shared by  ROTATE Birger Christensen (@rotatebirgerchristensen) on Apr 5, 2019 at 12:02pm PDT As with most things in 2019, the Eighties camp trend first caught my attention on Instagram when a bout of influencers began wearing Rotate, a new Danish brand that‚Äôs made exaggerated party dresses cool again. Its giant puff-sleeved mini dresses (done in hot pink jacquard and black satin) began popping up all over my feed.  In a time when the overall state of fashion feels pretty stagnant and boring (please, no more minimal slip dresses), the dramatic 1980s nostalgia was the only thing that felt exciting to me. I wanted to buy into the trend, but truly had no idea where someone could actually wear an ‚Äò80s party dress in the Year of Our Lord 2019. I don‚Äôt know about you, but I‚Äôm not going to many fancy dinner parties, nor am I even staying out past 9 p.m. these days. So when I ordered my Rotate dress, I decided to test drive its wearability by going to one of my favorite hot spots: Whole Foods.  I immediately learned you carry yourself entirely differently while wearing towering shoulder pads. It‚Äôs a look that says, watch me scam you out of millions and then sip a dry martini deviously afterwards. I suddenly completely understood why people dressed like this in the 1980s, because it makes you feel one hundred percent like THAT BITCH. A few heads turned, but this is New York so mostly no one was really phased by my pink party dress, enormous crystal drop earrings, and ruffled polka dot pumps in the snack aisle at 2 p.m. on a Tuesday. I quickly became obsessed with Dynasty-inspired fashion and started making ‚Äò80s mood boards on Instagram. Game of Thrones was cool, I‚Äôm sure, but have you ever seen the O.G. Alexis Carrington slap Krystle in the face while wearing shoulder pads bigger than Mount Everest? That‚Äôs the kind of television that really changes you. The Instagram account @WhatAlexisWore (tracking all of Joan Collins' ultra-glam outfits on Dynasty) became my new go-to, further fueling my obsession of the look.     s04e15 ~ Who needs the MET Gala? This is every day in Denver. #whatalexiswore üòÜ . . . . . #alexiscarringtoncolby #alexiscarrington #joancollins #nolanmiller #dynastyfashion #costumedesign #80sfashion #cwdynasty #dynasty #fashionhistory @cw_dynasty #powersuit #alexiscolby #damejoancollins A post shared by  What Alexis Wore (@whatalexiswore) on May 8, 2018 at 9:34am PDT  But if I‚Äôm being honest, while the Rotate dress and Alessandra Rich earrings were really fun, I wanted to figure out how to channel the Decade of Greed in a way that felt slightly less extra than my Whole Foods run. The middle-ground, I discovered, was in heart-shaped accessories, and moderately puffed sleeves and shoulder pads that you can style with jeans for a more modern take on the look.   I found a ton of ‚Äò80s-worthy blouses from C/Meo Collective‚Äîwith shoulder pads that felt fancy without breaking the bank or making me look completely over the top. From BaubleBar to Oscar de la Renta, there‚Äôs a wide variety of playful heart earrings that feel just the right amount of kitsch. The end result? A Working Girl-approved look that doesn‚Äôt look like it‚Äôs working too hard. But it‚Äôs still fun, glam, and Alexis Carrington-approved.  Is it camp? Who really knows anymore, but if you‚Äôre looking to be excited by fashion again, now‚Äôs the time to pump up the volume (literally) of the ‚Äò80s trend.

 She resorted to the age-old abhorred socks-and-sandals fad, but this time, we actually kind of like it. There are few fads in fashion that are as detested as the wearing of socks with sandals. Glimpsing the abomination‚Äîusually in the form of thick, soiled socks paired with Velcro-strapping sandals‚Äîimmediately induces the memory of your dad wearing some similar ensemble to a parent-teacher's conference in high school, much to your embarrassment. Suffice to say, this duo is anathema to all fashion common sense. Still, that didn't deter supermodel Gigi Hadid from tapping into the trend. While attending WARDROBE.NYC's collection launch event on Wednesday, Hadid wore black crew socks with a pair of Valentino Birkenstocks. To our surprised delight, it actually kind of worked.    Maybe it comes as no surprise that Hadid is able to make the usually inept look work for her‚Äîafter all, she is a style trailblazer. And, of course, it also helps that the rest of her outfit doesn't resemble anything a fashionably clueless dad would probably wear. With her hair pulled back into a neat half-bun, Hadid finished off her outfit with delicate gold necklaces, a plain white tee, black biker shorts, and oversized denim layers. She carried a small handbag with a black-and-white lightning bolt print to the event as well.

 They had us at varsity jacket with pearl buttons... As a mom to a one-year old, baby clothes are a whole new world. But, thankfully, in a sea of t-shirts with sparkling rainbows and fussy pinafores, there are a few select, beautiful brands to discover. Enter: Leah + Rae. The collection, which launched in February, was founded by Brittany Peltz Buerstedde as an answer to the dream of beautiful children's-wear that doesn't inhibit a little one's ability to move and play freely‚Äîwith approachable prices ranging from $44-$150.   I knew I was in love when I came across the baby basket bag in the brand's initial offering. The collection is pretty but unfussy, simple, but with thoughtful details like hand-embroidery on a white blouse and pearl buttons on a varsity jacket. And each piece is super soft, meant for every day life, not to be stored for special occasions only. BAZAAR.com spoke with the designer and Manhattan-based mom to daughters (and brand models) Eva and Lila Rae, to see why she wanted to enter of the realm of children's fashion and which famous baby she'd love to see wear Leah + Rae.  Why did you want to launch your line? After giving birth to my second daughter I had a hard time finding clothes that resonated with my aesthetic. I wanted to create styles that were beautiful, unique and also wearable. I also believe that children are so beautiful on their own and clothes should speak to that instead of distract from it.  What did you think was missing in the children‚Äôs market that you thought it could fill? I felt that most brands were full of extremes‚Äîsuper classic to the point of feeling outdated and buttoned up, full on bohemian without a sophisticated flair, or completely modern with loud colors and statement pieces.  As a mom of two girls who are equal part princess and tom boy I wanted to created a collection that incorporated the graceful beauty of little girls who make believe they are queen for a day while also speaking to their spunky side that drives them to race down slides and chase clouds on swing-sets.  I wanted to create the best quality product which was always a priority and frankly a responsibility without having to compromise on price. Affordability was always key.  Does the collection reflect your own personal style? In many ways, yes, especially in the sense that I dress in simple styles and color palettes that incorporate key pieces or accessories to elevate the look. The line also incorporates both ends of my style spectrum that include romantic dresses and blouses that are balanced out by my sportier days of jeans and a white tee.  I have also incorporated my belief that clothes should not only be beautiful but should also inspire movement and play which comes from my background as a figure skater.  Who is it named for? The brightest lights of my life, my two daughters whose middle names are Leah and Rae.  Is it more difficult to design for boys? I definitely have more immediate female inspiration with my two daughters but am lucky that many of my best friends have boys who inspire me in many ways.  At this point the collection has more styles for girls but includes quite a few unisex styles as well. Even though I always try to design a full or complete collection I have to fall fully in love with each piece before I go into production, which means I will never just add more styles for numbers sake but instead because I really feel they are a must.  What is your design process like? All of my collections up to date have been designed during my time in the country. This was not intentional on my part but somehow happened this way. I‚Äôm definitely very connected to nature and I find that I can best tune into what is inspiring me during those quite, undisturbed hours even if they happen to be while my husband and girls are sleeping. I do not design like most artists with a broad idea or theme that dictates the overall direction. I start with one silhouette, style or swatch which seamlessly melts into another until the majority of the collection is sketched out. Once I have overlooked it I then see if there are any pieces that I feel are missing and add those in as needed to make sure the collection flows. I always want my pieces to be versatile within the collection and be able to easily mix and match seamlessly. Interestingly enough, I don‚Äôt often recognize what inspired me until the editing phase where I overlook the larger picture‚Äîonly then does my initial spark, or inspiration become clear.What, who or where inspires you when designing? I am very inspired by my travels and most notably by my childhood summers spent in the Cote d‚ÄôAzure. I was very drawn to and inspired by their effortless sense of beauty and muted color palette... What has been most helpful for you in spreading the word about your brand? Moms! One of the best parts about being a Mother is the other Mothers you meet and connect with‚Äîthe bond and support system is like no other and there truly isn‚Äôt a better way to get honest advice and feedback. There is an amazing, underlying trust that comes from all of us wanting the very best for our children.  What famous baby would you love to see in the Collection? It‚Äôs a very good question, since they often have access to so many amazing brands. I would definitely be honored to see a well-known mom chose Leah + Rae for their child but I have to say how truly grateful and inspired I am by the incredible, ‚Äúeveryday‚Äú moms who have really fallen in love with the brand. The amazing working moms and stay-at-home Moms who have really gravitated to our aesthetic and what we stand for, moms who have amazing values and careers. That is what really excites me! But without escaping your question, I would have to say it would be pretty amazing to see Princess Charlotte in Leah + Rae, because who isn‚Äôt in love with a modern fairytale. Leah + Rae is available at saks.com. maisonette.com and leahandrae.com.
 The Off-White designer recreates 10 classic Nike sneakers.  In the collaboration of every hypebeast's dream, Virgil Abloh and Nike have joined forces for a new sneaker range. Nike tapped the Off-White designer to recreate 10 of its most iconic footwear styles for a project dubbed "The Ten." Bringing his distinct streetwear aesthetic to the table, Abloh redesigned Nike classics like the Air Jordan I, Air Max 90, Air Force 1 Low, Converse Chuck Taylor and more.  "What we're talking about here is larger than sneakers, it‚Äôs larger than design culture. It‚Äôs nothing short of state-of-the-art design. These 10 shoes have broken barriers in performance and style. To me, they are on the same level as a sculpture of David or the Mona Lisa. You can debate it all you want, but they mean something. And that's what's important," Abloh said in a release shared by Nike.  The ten styles are separated into two themes, "Revealing" and "Ghosting," with the former featuring classic, open-cut designs and the latter featuring translucent uppers for a more futuristic vibe. The sneakers may vary slightly in terms of design but all ten feature a distinct red zip tie through the laces. Abloh also brought his tongue-in-cheek logos to the designs, with "SHOELACES" written across some of the actual laces and "AIR" superimposed on the sides of the Nike Air VaporMax, Air Jordan I and Air Presto shoes.  The first five sneakers of "The Ten" project‚Äîthe Air Jordan I, Nike Blazer, Nike Air Presto, Nike Air Max 90, and Nike Air VaporMax‚Äîwill be pre-released in New York City (September 9-13), London (September 18-22), Milan (September 21-25) and Paris (September 26-30) at NikeLab stores.  The full collection will launch in November at NikeLab stores and select retailers worldwide.
 Photographer Karim Tabar captured the week's best looks.  The 2018 Burning Man festival just concluded in Black Rock Desert, Nevada and the beautiful desert made for the perfect setting for incredible photography.  Photographer Karim Tabar was on the scene to capture the essence of the festival, and best looks, from the annual event. Here are some of the most breathtaking shots from his week in the desert. 
 Rinna's daughter, Amelia Gray Hamlin, walked her first fashion show today for Dennis Basso.  Each season of New York Fashion Week always holds the runway debut of at least one celebrity or supermodel offspring. (Take Cindy Crawford's daughter Kaia Gerber, for example.) This morning, it was Lisa Rinna's 16-year-old daughter, Amelia Gray Hamlin, making her big introduction to the catwalk at Dennis Basso's Spring 2018 show. To f√™te the occasion, the Real Housewives star was present to epically cheer on her daughter from the front row. In the greatest real life transformation into Regina George's mom from Mean Girls, Rinna stood up and captured a full panoramic video of her daughter's walk. "WOO, that's my daughter!" she shouted in the moment that every teenager dreads.   It was a cool mom cheer that would have done Amy Poehler proud:   Of course, Rinna isn't the first celebrity mom to go all Mean Girls for her daughter's runway walk. Back in 2015, Kris Jenner had a similar reaction when Kendall Jenner walked her first Victoria's Secret Fashion Show.  Rinna was basically the second coming of the "You're Doing Amazing Sweetie" meme: After the show, Rinna shared the video she captured of Amelia's runway debut on Instagram:   We could not be more proud of @ameliagray walking in her first show ever today opening and closing the show for @dennisbassonyc #ss18 ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è A post shared by  Lisa Rinna (@lisarinna) on Sep 11, 2017 at 9:02am PDT  "We could not be more proud of @ameliagray walking in her first show ever today for @dennisbassonyc," she wrote in a caption.  Congratulations to Amelia Gray‚Äîand here's to hoping for more embarrassing mom moments to come from the front row (sorry Amelia!).
 Photographer Karim Tabar captured the week's best looks. The 2019 Burning Man festival just concluded in Black Rock Desert, Nevada and photographer Karim Tabar was on the scene to capture the essence, the scene, and the best looks from the annual event. Here, some of the most daring ensembles from the year's most talked-about festival‚Äîand the stories behind them. Occupation: Model, DJ & Fashion E-commerce Owner "For me, Burning Man is a way to disconnect from the 'real' world. When I'm back from it, it feels like a fresh start. Burning Man is my New Year's Eve. As a creative person, it also inspires me a lot for what I do. I love the spontaneous nature of it." Occupation: Model "While I was born and raised in a quiet town near Toronto, Canada,  I'm [now] vagabonding across the world working full time as a fashion model. Not only do I travel often for work, I always seem to find myself in new cities just for the sake of enjoyment. In the last year I've been to over 20 cities! Burning Man is like another city, but it feels like my home [away] from home." Occupation: Model and Nutritional Science Student "I was going for a galactic, other worldly type of look that day. It was my first time at Burning Man and I love to switch up my vibe from spacey to earthy." Occupation: Musician & Sound Healer "My look is inspired by the Oracle of Siwa and the Egyptian sound healers of the temples of Hathor‚Äîthey were gifted musicians, astrologers, and alchemists." Occupation: TV Host & Actress "My look was inspired by a warrior woman, like Joan of Arc or Nefertiti. A woman who has forged and grown with each challenge of life; A woman who been through the storm and survived; A woman who‚Äôs fully awakened and is taking a stand, taking problems by the horns and has no fear to conquer the world." Occupation: Fashion Stylist & TV Personality "I was at Burning Man to express myself and inspire others to be their authentic selves." "I love strange and interesting looks and have always had a diverse range of style, but I‚Äôm constantly feeling so limited as to what I can get away with in normal life. I wanted to take full advantage of every aspect of radical self expression and totally transform my looks and style as I wish. The hair, the accessories, the wigs‚Äîsomething a bit different and a bit futuristic."  Occupation: Physics Major and Pre M.B.A. "My look was simple because it was sunrise, but I wanted it to match my art car: the passionflower which during the day is pink and blue."  Occupation: Model and Costume Designer "This look was inspired by the art at Burning Man, where some can be very colorful and playful." Occupation: Social Entrepreneur, Model, and Humanitarian "For me, Burning Man is all about human connection andself discovery." "This look, I didn‚Äôt think about so much. I wanted to look how I wanted to feel that day: light yet strong." Occupation: Model "I like to play with outfits at Burning Man. So, when I see something nice during the year, I will buy it. I have too many accessories, so I mix and match with everything until I am happy with my look and go dance into the playa." Occupation: : Model "My all-red look was my friend Marta and Elbio's idea, because they say it is the color of love and passion, and also because they got married on Tuesday."
 The Hadid's turned the theme park into their own runway. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. Between the lines, crowds, and screaming kids, Disneyland isn't always the most glamorous of places to visit. But leave it to Gigi and Bella Hadid to turn the theme park into their own runway.  The sisters took a day trip to Disney's California park for their friend Leah McCarthy‚Äôs 25th birthday. Going for coordinating athleisure looks, the Hadid's each donned shorts and crop tops. Gigi opted for summer's tie-dye trend in a two-piece set by Cotton Citizen, while Bella went for an all-black look in baggy basketball shorts and a leopard-trimmed tank by UNIF. Sorry kids, but none of us have ever looked this cool in line for Splash Mountain.  Each of the models topped off their looks with tube socks and sneakers‚ÄîBella in a black Burberry pair and Gigi in ASH's Extreme sneakers. Bella accessorized with heart-shaped earrings by Frasier Sterling and a diamond nameplate necklace by LaJoux. Gigi, meanwhile, tied a Cotton Citizen sweater around her waist and wore a pair of her own Gigi Hadid x Vogue sunglasses and a gold Missoma chain necklace.  While at the park, Gigi and Bella posed for a group shot with their friends (as you do), which was later posted by the birthday girl on Instagram (again, as you do).

 In her latest role, Maggie Gyllenhaal plays an enterprising escort in HBO's new series The Deuce, and heads to the office to showcase the season's hottest trends. The Deuce, HBO‚Äôs slick new show about the legalization of the pornography industry in 1970s New York, has a lot of big-ticket items going for it: a cozy premium-cable home; the guidance of showrunner David Simon, who also created the acclaimed series The Wire; James Franco playing twin brothers in seedy pre-Giuliani Times Square. But all of that pales in comparison to Maggie Gyllenhaal‚Äôs star turn as Candy Merrell, a Times Square sex worker who gets drawn into the emergent porn industry‚Äîas a behind-the-scenes player. For our October issue, Gyllenhaal celebrated Candy‚Äôs entrepreneurial spirit by embodying a different sort of working woman in the season‚Äôs best suits. In between takes, we asked her some questions about her meaty new role. HARPER'S BAZAAR: What drew you to the project, initially? MAGGIE GYLLENHAAL: I think it had something to do with Michelle MacLaren, who directed the pilot and also the last episode. It was her who kind of said to David and George, "You should meet Maggie." So she made the introduction. Then we all had a great meeting in New York, where I had read the first three episodes, which were all that was written when we began shooting. HB: What was it about those first three episodes and the character? There‚Äôs quite an arc to the first eight episodes, and after Episode 5, it really changes her identity. MG: One thing I was really drawn to in the very first episode is, often, when you see a portrayal of a prostitute, you only get the element of her life at work. You don't get to see the rest of her. Right away in the first episode, there's a very explicit scene where I say to that kid, "This is my job.‚Äù I loved that idea. You do get to see her as a daughter, and a mother, and a businesswoman, I think, even in the beginning. And an artist. You see her in relation to all of those things. Prostitution is just one aspect of that. And a lover of someone who she's actually chosen, and sex is not transactional. You see all of it. I was compelled by that. I was compelled also by the quality of the writing. I think it's rare to find writing that good. That's what we had to talk about when we met: What is the story you're telling, and how can this be fit into it, and how does she shift and change? How is she empowered and disempowered? How do those affect each other? We talked about all of that. I think it was important to me‚Äîbecause it is such a delicate subject matter in 2017‚Äîto be a part of the storytelling, and to have a guarantee that I would be a part of the storytelling.   HB: Can you talk about the idea of how you see her as an artist? Where do you see that manifesting in the early episodes? MG: I think in the early episodes, this was me pushing some of this into what was there in the script. After we started shooting and they saw what I was doing, I started seeing those things actually explicitly in the script. But I think in the second episode, where I go to make my first porn and I'm thinking that it's not-very-well-paid sex work I'm kind of doing as a favor to a friend‚Äîonce I get in that room, I think that Candy has a kind of a ... it's almost like the birth of an artist. She's totally consumed by what's happening with the lights, by the sounds, by what happens when you take the frame of a camera and you put it around something that you've known your whole life, that you're expert in. How does it change it? How does it shift it? How does it lift it up? Something has woken up in her, and she can't put it back to sleep.  HB: Did you do research for the role, in terms of talking to actual sex workers and porn stars from the period? MG: I did, yeah. Right before we started shooting the pilot, I was like, "I need to talk to a prostitute. I have so many questions." And Nina Noble, who is the third in the triumvirate of George Pelecanos and David Simon, who's their producing partner‚ÄîI was like, "Nina, how do I find a prostitute to talk to?" She hooked me up with this woman, Annie Sprinkle, who is kind of a sex activist, or performer, but she was a prostitute in the '70s. We talked a lot. She gave me a lot of nitty-gritty details and answered a lot of questions I had, but she also introduced me to all of these women who were either prostitutes or involved in the beginning of porn in the early '70s.   HB: What were your burning questions that you wanted to ask these women to help you better understand how to get into character? MG: Mostly I just let them talk. But I had some basic questions for Annie, like, "How many men do you sleep with a night? What do you do if it's extremely cold outside?" I mean, research-type things. HB: What are the challenges of playing a sex worker? What do you see as the stigmas, still, that these women face today? MG: I think that, in many cases, being a prostitute requires a huge amount of disassociation. I think it's very difficult to keep your mind intact and awake, and vibrant, when you have to disassociate so much. Not impossible, clearly, because some of the women that I talked to were totally able to do it, but I think a lot of people aren't, and I think the consequences can be really dire. But Candy can. Candy's somebody who has her mind intact.  HB: How did it feel to be depicting such a radically different New York City, even though it wasn't so very long ago? MG: I guess in a way, because there were so many great movies made in New York in the ‚Äò70s, I think there is this fantasy that it was this incredible time. I know it was lawless and dirty, and darker in a way than it is now, probably. I was born in '77, and my parents lived in the Lower East Side. I was a baby, and then I moved to LA, so I don't really have a lot of memories of Times Square from that time. I have a memory of being seven, and visiting my aunt Frieda and uncle Murray in New York, and they took me to see a Broadway play. We were driving in Times Square in a taxi, and I remember them talking in Yiddish, and I couldn't understand Yiddish. They were saying something, and then they would say "ladies of the night." I asked them, "What's that?" And they kind of shamed me: "Shush. We don't talk about that." It's a memory that really stuck with me, because of course ‚Äúladies of the night‚Äù is such an interesting phrasing. HB: Yeah. That's quite a phrasing. It's an impact like, "What does that mean, 'ladies of the night'?" MG: One of the books I really liked was called Ladies of The Night. It was a photography book made in '71, I think. It was just transcriptions of conversations with prostitutes in New York, and then photographs of them. Pretty much everyone said, "We're fine, we‚Äôre choosing this, we even like it," or "There are lots of things about this life that we like. It's great." And then there will be tiny little unconscious contradictions all the way through, which I also found with talking to a lot of the women that I talked to. In fact, I was really straight with Annie, who says she's a sexual healer. I was like, "Okay. But what about the other side? What about the dark side? It's a hard life to have sex with eight to 10 men a night. That's hard physically, let alone emotionally.‚Äù And sometimes people were willing to have that conversation, but more often than not, that wasn't really the tack that they were taking with me. It was about sexual freedom and sexual excitement. That's sort of how they wanted to talk about it. I mean, when we were making the show, it was the wind-up to the presidential election in 2016. And to be thinking about misogyny, to be thinking about sexism and the compromises that we have to make as women with our minds, with our bodies, with our money, with our art‚Äîthey were real, even before Donald Trump was elected. They were a part of everything. It's just that I think they're way more on the table now.  HB: Do you feel that it's important for you, now, to speak out when we can't take all these things for granted that we did this time last year? MG: I don't know. It's so easy to retweet things that are interesting and political on Twitter. It's another thing to have your own voice, and to think and say things that are important to you. Sometimes, I want to talk about all of them, and other times I don‚Äôt want to say anything. I just want people to watch it and see what vibrates inside them.

 The open air show was hit by a rainstorm. Taking place just outside Paris at the Mus√©e Vivant du Cheval √† Chantilly, Dior's Cruise 2019 show was hit by a rainstorm, but even the weather couldn't halt proceedings. And while Chanel's Cruise 2019 show featured an actual cruise ship, Dior had horses walking the runway alongside models.  The historic venue, which was built in the 18th century for Louis Henri de Bourbon, saw the show take place in the open air, which meant that Dior's models literally walked in the rain. Guests were given umbrellas as they entered, and a combination of bad traffic and weather delayed the show's start time by almost two hours.  Witness the splendor of the Cruise 2019 show venue moments before the guests arrive and the highly-anticipated collection is unveiled. Click on the link in bio to ensure you experience it live as it happens!  #DiorCruise A post shared by  Dior Official (@dior) on May 25, 2018 at 11:17am PDT As WWD notes, the show's display by Mexican rodeo riders was emblematic of the collection, as the "fearlessness of the sport taps right into Maria Grazia Chiuri's love for strong women." The publication described Dior's Cruise 2019 collection as combining "the finest of Latin American and European equestrian tradition."   Not everyone was a fan of the horses though, as Paris Jackson was spotted leaving the show only minutes in, presumably out of concern for animal welfare. Dior's press release about the show noted that Maria Grazia Chiuri was "inspired by the Amazons and more particularly the escaramuzas: Mexican female riders who practice an art traditional reserved for men while asserting their femininity, wearing full skirts and imposing hats." The collection featured a plethora of embroidered bags and purses: Accessories included a selection of hats, and animal-themed bags: The models were unperturbed by the unfavorable weather: Despite the journey to the rural location, and the slightly problematic open air setting, celebs also flocked to watch the show: If anything, the inclement only added to the show's atmosphere. Here, Maria Grazia Chiuri walks the runway:  
 Shop the skirt your summer wardrobe is missing‚Äîand your fall one, too...  The denim mini, is in fact, a classic masquerading as a trend piece. It can be done up in light wash or dark wash denim, black, or white, printed or distressed, edgy or polished. You can wear it with a feminine blouse, a menswear inspired jacket, with double denim, with a simple tee. In a shocking turn of events, the denim maxi skirt has staged a recent comeback. See what else is happening in the land of chic denim skirts. A long white skirt makes for an unexpected summer staple. We love it with a simple black tank and low white sandals. Just add minimal basics for a chic '90s inspired look. A denim pencil skirt gives that workwear-meets-weekend-wear vibe we're always searching for.  This slim fit pencil skirt can be worn with a bodysuit and flat sandals to lunch, and paired with a blazer and heels for a work day. What's not to love about a slightly slouchy, light wash maxi skirt? We love the denim on denim pairing by Sylvie Mus. We love this summer-ready skirt. It's so light-weight, we're picturing it¬†with a maillot for post-beach cocktails. Tessa Thompson takes a simple jean skirt and black tank look to high fashion places thanks to a full-skirted silhouette and major accessories, all by Miu Miu. This skirt is already #extra thanks to some studding, but that doesn't mean you can't also wear a major earring with it. This look basically swaps jeans for a mini skirt to lend more interest to your go-to basics. And a leopard print bag is always a good idea. This mini is a true classic for those with a bit of the wild child in them. A black mini makes a great base for bold pieces like this oversized blazer. Simple thong sandals ground the whole idea. If you want to go super mini, keep it classic black. In case you were wondering if the ever-lengthening denim skirt trend had legs, look ahead to Celine Fall 2019 for proof that it's just getting started. 
 She passed away just hours after her husband.  Judith Leiber, the designer behind fashion's most ornate minaudi√®res, passed away at the age of 97 on Saturday in New York, WWD reports. The designer died just hours after the death of her husband of 72 years, Gerson Leiber, also aged 97. Both Leibers died of natural causes at their home.  Best known for her bejeweled and luxurious handbags that doubled as works of art, Leiber's designs have been carried by everyone from Greta Garbo to Diana Ross, Sarah Jessica Parker, and a number of First Ladies including Barbara Bush and Hillary Clinton. Her work has also been displayed at a wide range of museums including The Smithsonian and The Metropolitan Museum of Art.  Born in 1921 in Budapest, Hungary, Leiber was a Holocaust survivor who moved to the United States at the end of World War II right after marrying Gus Leiber.  Her experience hiding in a crammed apartment in order to survive the Holocaust helped inspire her future career in design, "There were 26 people in a one bedroom apartment. It was pretty terrible. I designed handbags in my head to get through the misery," Leiber told BAZAAR.com.  After selling handmade bags to members of the armed forces in Hungary, Leiber went on to work for several handbag manufacturers in New York before launching her own namesake brand in 1963. Ten years later, she became the first woman in her field and first accessories designer to win a Coty award. In 1993, she then won the Lifetime Achievement award from the Council of Fashion Designers of America‚Äîmarking the first time the award was given to a handbag designer. In 2005, The Leiber Collection Museum opened in East Hampton, New York. The space showcases both the works of Judith and Gerson Leiber, who was an abstract painter. The grounds, which include six acres of ornate sculptural gardens, display many of Leiber's most luxurious handbags from the past several decades‚Äîmany of which sold for upwards of $4,000 and $5,000. 
 It's a good day when Chanel goes Nautical... Since Chanel invented the concept of the Cruise collection specifically for holiday in Biarritz, it's only fitting that the brand show its most recent one beneath the hull of a ship that appeared to be heading right about there straight from the Grand Palais. The La Pausa liner was docked for the duration of the runway show, 88 looks of pure nautical delight‚Äîcomplete with shark tooth, wave and boat prints, big round sunglasses, white tights and berets in tweed, cotton or sequins, all of done up in white, black, pastel shades, and sunset worthy pinks and blues.

 The supermodels are longtime friends of artistic director Kim Jones.   Just last week Louis Vuitton‚Äôs menswear artistic director, Kim Jones announced the Fall 2018 collection would be his final for the French house. Jones has been the mastermind behind Vuitton's streetwear sensibility‚Äîintroducing sneakers and track pants and eventually, the larger than life Supreme collaboration. The designer, who has been at the helm since 2011 took his final bow today in Paris with not one but two supermodels. Jones invited longtime friends Naomi Campbell and Kate Moss to close out the show.  Both supermodels wore Louis Vuitton monogram print trench coats in black and brown (we can already imagine the growing waitlist). Jones, Campbell and Moss all wore matching black combat boots. On January 16th Kate Moss celebrated her 44th birthday in London. She last hit the runway with Naomi Campbell last May for Campbell's charity show, Runway for Relief during the Cannes Film Festival.  There has been no news yet on who will replace Jones at Louis Vuitton. 
 Princess Margaret's museum-worthy 21st birthday dress is also on display.

According to The Standard, the dress is on loan to the V&A by the Museum of London.Oriole Cullen, the V&A's fashion and textiles curator, said in a statement that ‚Äúin 1947, Christian Dior changed the face of fashion with his ‚ÄòNew Look,‚Äô which redefined the female silhouette and reinvigorated the post-War Parisian fashion industry. More than seventy years after its founding, the V&A‚Äôs exhibition will celebrate the enduring influence of the House of Dior and uncover Dior‚Äôs relationship with Britain.‚Äù The exhibit also features custom pieces explicitly made for the red carpet, such as Jennifer Lawerence's red gown for the Oscars. Also on display are Christian Dior‚Äôs personal possessions, accessories, fashion photography, film, vintage perfume, original make-up, and illustrations.

 File under: news you can use... You can hardly stumble down a street in a major city without seeing at least one Staud bag. Those boxy little retro-inspired gems and adorable buckets are just the sort of price-point approachable, chic It item that style-savvy ladies want in their arsenals. Sarah Staudinger is banking on her uncanny ability to create cool, collectible accessories with a new line of footwear, launching today.  The spring collection of six classic sandals styles share that same streamlined, minimal-but-not-boring vibe as her bags. And because shoes are meant to be tried on, Staud is opening its New York showroom from March 1 to May 15 by appointment-only so customers can "shop the showroom." Hint: it's also very Instagram-worthy, much like Staud gear itself. Below hear from Staudinger on her new venture and why shoes are basically in her DNA.  Why were shoes the next category you wanted to delve into? When we initially launched in 2015, we released two styles but then decided to put shoes on hold and focus our attention to handbags. I think there‚Äôs something missing from the market right now in footwear. My Mom was actually a footwear designer back in the 70‚Äôs. She loves shoes and was constantly leaving little sketches around the house, so it was pretty much inevitable. What was the inspiration? 70‚Äôs in terms of our uppers but heel heights are definitely more 90‚Äôs inspired. The idea is that they feel timeless though, so they don‚Äôt pull from any one decade in particular or one source of inspiration. These are classic styles that have just enough flirt to them. From collection to collection you will see more of that come through in terms of color and print and fun novelty elements. How do they fit into the Staud story? To me they kind of speak the same language as our handbags. They are both timeless and fun. We took elements from our handbags and incorporated them into our footwear. The Bille wedge has a PVC strap calling back to the Shirley, the Keith comes in our classic croc embossed leather and the colorways sit with our Spring RTW pallet‚Äîa balance between neutrals and pops (of color).  The Hutton A post shared by  S T A U D (@staud.clothing) on Feb 25, 2019 at 2:16pm PST You just did your first runway show. It was so fun with models and dancers bringing so much energy down the catwalk. How would you explain your approach to the runway? For me, it‚Äôs a really important collection because fashion is not just about the way clothes make you feel, but the way people move in the clothes‚Ä¶It‚Äôs all about real people living‚Ä¶their best lives. We wanted a sense of playfulness and fun, not have it feel too serious, which is the STAUD girl to me. and email appt@staud.clothing to make an appointment at the New York showroom.
 The Aussie actress hopped on a boat, put on her J12, and talked about life after 30. Phoebe Tonkin has been acting for half of her life, starting with a teen show in her native Australia. The now-30-year-old has built up an impressive acting CV since then and is also known to her 5.2 million followers as an especially beautiful Instagram influencer. Tonkin can also add Chanel ambassador to her list of titles. The Parisian house staged a French seaside takeover on Shelter Island in the Hamptons this past weekend to fete its popular J12 watch. BAZAAR.com took this picturesque opportunity to shoot the New York-based Australian on a Chanel-branded sailboat and to ask Tonkin some questions about social media, her career, and what else when we're all here for a watch? Time.  Phoebe Tonkin: I started acting when I was about 15. I was taking all the drama classes and acting courses. I auditioned for Home and Away‚ÄîI don't know if Americans know about Home and Away‚Äîand didn't get it. And the second thing I auditioned for was a kid show called H2O. And that took me away from my kind of normal childhood, teenage adolescence for three years to shoot three seasons of it in the Gold Coast‚ÄîI was Sydney based. And then from there, I kind of ‚Ä¶ I don't know if I fell in love with acting so much as I fell in love with the world of what making film and TV was and is. I just love being on set. I feel like, I mean, I'm 30 now, the first set I was on, I was 15. So half of my life I've been on a set, and it's so familiar to me. I feel so comfortable. I think I fell in love with the world of telling stories. H20 was quite popular in Australia and then got bought by Netflix over here. But in terms of what I feel like changed my own kind of trajectory in terms of just personally how I felt about working, it was a show called Safe Harbour that's on Hulu. I shot it about two years ago and it just ‚Ä¶ I don't know, I think it just rejuvenated my passion for telling stories again, and why I love doing it, and the impulsivity, and the just passion. It was a very small budget, with just some of the most incredible talents and creative in Australia all involved in it. It was just so inspiring to me, and every day was such a treat to be on set, even when I wasn't working, I just absorbed everything I saw. Yeah. Safe Harbour was the one, at least as an adult, that really kind of reshaped where I wanted to go with my career. I met Ilona Hamer [who styled this shoot] about nine years ago at a Chanel event in Australia that I was invited to‚ÄîIlona helped style me for it. And then a few years later, she was shooting something for Chanel and she had all of these samples in her apartment. Our friend Adrian [Mesko] was a photographer and we'd all had a glass of wine or something, and Ilona said, "Why don't we shoot Phoebe in some of these samples and Adrian can shoot it?" It was just the three of us sitting at her apartment, and she took the photos, put them on her blog, and sent them to Chanel in Australia. And that was sort of how I got properly introduced. And then from then, I shot a few covers and editorials, and went to a few shows. But I became an ambassador last year. I think there's something really kind of timeless and classic and elegant, but still sort of strong and a little rebellious about the Chanel woman. And I like being part of a brand that really wants you to feel and look like yourself, while still sort of being a face, or a representation of the house. That you can style the clothes in a way that you would wear them, as opposed to being put in full head-to-toe looks. And even today, this shoot is exactly how I would probably be going on a boat‚Äîexcept with more Chanel. It's totally a love. Personally, I think that there should be no likes, because I think that's where the trouble is. I think maybe not for people in the public eye, but for young people. I just can't imagine being 13 and my friends are all getting, like, 49 likes, and I'm getting 14 likes. It's just horrible. You're gauging how popular you are, quite literally, by a number. But for me, I try to use it like as a scrapbook, and I feel really lucky. I get to do a lot of really fun things, and I get to share that with people. And I always say to people not to take it too seriously. Like, my life doesn't look like what it looks like on Instagram, obviously. I think no one really shows that true, true life. Otherwise, it would be a pretty miserable place. Or maybe I'm being really cynical. I think take it with a grain of salt. I think Instagram should be looked at like a magazine‚Äîlike you're looking at an editorial version of someone's life. And obviously, there are aspects of it that are true, and then there are aspects of it that are shinier, and aspects of people that are trying to prove something. But I think if you can find a healthy relationship with it, which is what I try to find, like I have a cap on it that I can only use it for a certain amount of time. All because it's such time wasted. You're scrolling and you're like, "This is my teacher's dog's Instagram influencer's auntie, someone." I can just get on these tangent holes and have no idea of how I got there. I think as long as you look at it for what it is and not take it like comparing your life to someone else's, I think it can be good.  Right? I really challenged a lot of people. See? That's where I find, for me, Instagram is really tricky, because I don't think some people realize the power of their influence. And it's so fine to have fun and to do silly things, and no one's perfect in any way. But I do think if you do have that reach, why not try and inspire someone to do something really, really positive? So, you know, if those things take off, and you've got kids trying to mimic and replicate that, what an amazing opportunity to take that on and turn it on its head and be like, "Hey, you know what's super cool? Saving the environment. That's so cool." I nearly lost my robe during that video. But that was fun.  This is the NEW BOTTLE CAP CHALLENGE okay? IRL Slow mo and everything! Let‚Äôs stop making silly challenges and killing our ocean friends! K cool! #reusable #waterbottlechallenge @kleankanteen üñ§ A post shared by  Phoebe Tonkin (@phoebejtonkin) on Jul 9, 2019 at 6:39am PDT I'm going to say the last year has been pretty inspiring for me, just in terms of‚Äînow I'm going to get very hippy-dippy‚Äîwhat the universe is able to show you, given patience and being open to letting things go and change and be. If I could look back over the last 12, 18 months, as sort of this little map to where I am right now, there's nothing I would change, even though there were some very hard experiences. I think when you look at time as this sort of journey, I think that's a really beautiful way to see that there's no regrets in life and everything happens for a reason. I was on a show for a long time, and I spent a lot of time in Atlanta, and I knew I was going to be in Atlanta for a long time. And that period felt, now when I look back, quite quick. Like, I felt that I closed my eyes and I was 22, and then suddenly I was, like, 27. That whole time was very quick, I think. I mean, any, like, line at the DMV maybe. I don't know. Probably I feel like this year hasn't gone slow, but I definitely have been really taking my time to enjoy it. I think right now is the happiest time. I think 30 is the best. I mean, I've been 30 for a week. I was really excited to turn 30. I think even though it's just a number, there's just something kind of, I don't know, momentous about a new decade in your life. And I really think this is going to be a good one for me.  I think when I feel my best, it's when I feel creatively fulfilled and satisfied, and challenged. I feel loved and respected by the people in my life, whether that's boyfriends or friends. And when I feel like I'm, in turn, being loving and kind and grateful and also being healthy. Getting a lot of ocean swims in a day. I have to say this past weekend when all my girlfriends, well, most of my girlfriends, were able to come to New York and spend the weekend with me. I felt very loved. Everyone's sort of busy and got their own lives, and we were all able to just, I don't know, be together. And you realize that girlfriends, no matter what age, no matter what happens, they are always consistent in your life. It's such a good reminder when you go through breakups or through anything in your life ‚Ä¶ they're always there. And it was just really nice to be surrounded by so many of them.  I would say a consistent compliment is when I'm in the ocean. That's when a boyfriend would be like, "Wow, you look so pretty," if I'm just jumping around in the sea. Maybe it's because I'm happy then.
 We can't stop staring at this outfit. Victoria's Secret x Balmain may be the collaboration on everybody's lips this season, but don't let that distract you from VS's long-running (and equally stunning) partnership with Swarovski. This marks the lingerie brand's 15th anniversary working with the renowned jeweler, and they're celebrating in a big way: One million Swarovski crystals will grace the catwalk through various looks in Shanghai, WWD reports.  Elsa Hosk, a VS Angel since 2015, will be wearing the leading look on the runway, which features 275,000 multicolored crystals, 200 yards of ribbon, hand-beaded jewelry, and 14-pound wings. "It is one of the heaviest wings we have ever made," Monica Mitro, executive vice president, brand communications and events at Victoria‚Äôs Secret, told WWD. In addition to its massive wings, the outfit, crafted by Parisian couturier Serkan Cura, includes a bright red bra and panty set, embellished long sleeves, and feathered sandals. "When I found out I was wearing the Swarovski look I was so excited as I‚Äôve always wanted to wear it. I can‚Äôt wait to walk down the runway in it," the Swedish model revealed. Hosk follows model Josephine Skriver, who wore the crystal-covered statement piece at last year's VS fashion show in Paris. Hosk's Swarovski ensemble won't be the only extravagant piece hitting the runway; there's also the highly-coveted Fantasy Bra. This year's iteration‚Äîmodeled by Lais Ribeiro‚Äîfeatures handset diamonds, yellow sapphires, and blue topaz in 18 karat gold, for a whopping price tag of $2 million dollars. We can't wait to see all these flashy items on the runway in Shanghai. The Victoria's Secret Fashion Show airs on CBS on November 28.
  The model wore Versace on and off the runway. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. Irina Shayk is currently hard at work for Milan Fashion Week.  The busy model just took to the runway for Versace wearing a seriously revealing red minidress. The skimpy chainmail look featured a low-cut V-neck and was adorned with acrylic tassels. Side note: Shayk, looking flawless as ever, is about to inspire your next night out with her neon makeup. Later in the night, Shayk was photographed wearing a crystal mesh Versace minidress on the streets of Milan. She paired the shimmering backless dress with strappy heels and a wet-hair style, and looked elated as she waved to photographers. Model sisters Bella and Gigi Hadid joined Shayk on the runway, as did Cindy Crawford's daughter, Kaia Gerber.   Meanwhile, Jennifer Lopez made her official runway debut when she closed the Versace show wearing a replica of the iconic dress she wore to the Grammys in February 2000. The 50-year-old's jaw-dropping appearance basically broke the Internet while transporting us all back to the turn of the millennium.   @jlo recreates her most iconic red carpet moment in @versace that launched Google image in 2000. ‚Äî@nicolefritton A post shared by  Harper's BAZAAR (@harpersbazaarus) on Sep 20, 2019 at 11:54am PDT As the BBC confirmed, Lopez's Grammys look was completely formative, with former Google CEO Eric Schmidt revealing that "there were so many searches for photos of the dress afterwards, it inspired them to create Google Images."
 The mustard two-piece is flawless. Emily Ratajkowski's surprise announcement, that she'd just gotten married to her boyfriend of a few weeks, Sebastian Bear-McClard, was met with excitement from her fans.  To break the news, Ratajkowski shared some sweet wedding snaps on Instagram, which revealed that she'd worn the cutest mustard pantsuit at her wedding. But the best news of all is that her suit is from Zara, and the two-piece retails for around $200.   As the model and actress chose the striking suit for her nuptials, it's highly likely that the items will sell out quickly. But for now, at least, both the vintage-inspired flared pants, and the long belted jacket, are available on Zara's website. While the pants retail for $69.90, the jacket is listed for just $129.  Ratajkowski's choice of wedding outfit might have bucked tradition but, as usual, the model looked completely flawless. She accessorized the eye-catching suit with a black  wide-brimmed hat, with a small veil attached, which will be total inspiration to anyone currently planning their own nuptials. Zara Flared Pants, $69.90 buy now Zara Long Belted Jacket, $129 buy now The Gone Girl star announced her wedding in her Instagram story yesterday with the caption, "Soooo I have a surprise. I got married today." According to reports, Ratajkowski quietly split with her longterm boyfriend Jeff Magid, and started seeing Bear-McClard sometime in 2018. They were spotted together for the first time in February following a dinner date in California. Her husband Bear-McClard is a movie producer who recently worked on Robert Pattinson's Good Time. Next, he'll produce Jonah Hill's Uncut Gems.

Both edgy and unique, the collaboration includes Saint Laurent fetish toys, skateboards, lighters, high-heeled roller skate boots, and even a YSL-branded Vespa.

 But have no fear, Behati Prinsloo, Kendall Jenner and Gigi Hadid will make their return. Tomorrow some of the biggest names in the modeling world are set to take the stage at the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show in New York‚Äîyet a few notable faces will be missing.  This will be the first year without VS Angel Alessandra Ambrosio. She's walked a total of 17 shows, but officially hung up her wings after the big show in Shanghai. Ambrosio's first show was in 2000 at 20 years old, just a year after fellow Brazilian Adriana Lima's first walk with the lingerie powerhouse. The duo became two of the most famous faces for the Victoria's Secret brand, but Adriana Lima will carry on without her Brazilian bombshell counterpart.  Victoria Secret will also be down another angel, Lily Aldridge. The California-born beauty is currently pregnant with her second child, which she announced on Instagram back in August.   ü§óü§óü§ó SURPRISEü§óü§óü§ó A post shared by  Lily Aldridge (@lilyaldridge) on Aug 19, 2018 at 12:22pm PDT The 32-year-old Angel is married to Kings of Leon frontman Caleb Followill, and already share a 6-year-old daughter together named Dixie.  On the other hand, several top names missing from last year will return to the lingerie extravaganza this year. Behati Prinsloo will finally make her return after a 3-year hiatus while she had two daughters with husband Adam Levine of Maroon 5.  Kendall Jenner and Gigi Hadid who skipped out on last year's Shanghai show will also hit the runway again in New York City tomorrow. Toni Garrn and Shanina Shaik are also a few names who have been missing from recent years and are excited to strut their stuff.

 The brand is the latest to ditch a traditional runway show.  Pictured above: Caroline Murphy Tali Lennox, Selah Marley  Joining a growing list of designers, rag & bone is the latest brand to skip New York Fashion Week this season. Unlike those moving their shows to Paris or Los Angeles, however, rag & bone is ditching the runway altogether for Spring 2018. Instead, the New York based brand will hold private appointments for press and release a charitable photo project to the public.  The photo project is a series of self-portraits featuring Carolyn Murphy, Selah Marley, Georgia Fowler, Bobby Cannavale, Maye Musk, Tali Lennox, and more. Along with taking their own self-portrait, each of the subjects selected a charity for rag & bone to make a donation to. As a result, over 20 organizations will receive donations including the Lupus Foundation of America, Earth Justice, Open Door Foundation, Oceana, and hurricane relief efforts for The American Red Cross and the Houston Humane Society. As the fashion calendar continues to shake up, trading in a runway show for a philanthropic endeavor certainly feels like a welcome change within the industry. As for the brands still showing at New York Fashion Week? Given the current political landscape, there's no doubt many of them will use the runway to make their own positive statements this season.

 The "Foam" platform shoes have proven to be a big hit. The spring/summer 2018 collections introduced the fashion circuit to the year's most unlikely "It" shoe‚Äîthe Croc. And the divisive shoe has finally been given the ultimate stamp of approval.  Christopher Kane first hinted that the rubber sandals were making a comeback, when he debuted rock-emblazoned Crocs at his spring/summer 2017 show. But it was Demna Gvasalia for Balenciaga which sealed the deal, as the designer introduced the FROW to a child-like take on the sandal. And the 10cm "Foam" platform shoes have already proven to be a massive hit with fans after managing to sell out online before they were even officially released. The Balenciaga shoes became available to pre-order on the Barneys website for a cool $850 on February 1, 2018, but sold out within a matter of hours.  Tough luck for those hoping to bag a pair ahead of the next wave of fashion week shows...  And it's an impressive sale for the shoe once dubbed the "dad sandal," but the soar in interest further proves Gvasalia's sartorial pulling power. And with everything from the  label's '80s-inspired spandex leggings, to Ikea-inspired accessories, there's no telling what the designer will convince the millennial set to buy next.

 The designer has a special connection to the couple's history.  Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas' highly-anticipated wedding weekend is here, and it's likely there will be several bridal gown looks to watch for. As we wait for photos to trickle in, one major detail has just been revealed: Priyanka will wear custom Ralph Lauren for at least one, if not more, of her wedding gown looks. Though the designer has yet to confirm the news, multiple sources including People report Priyanka will wear custom Ralph Lauren down the aisle. The actress' choice in designer is especially touching due to the couple's history with the American fashion brand. Both Jonas and Chopra attended the Met Gala together (their first ever red carpet appearance) in custom Ralph Lauren looks back in 2017.   If the rumors are true, Lauren designing Priyanka's wedding gown is a big deal, as the designer has only created bridal looks for his daughter, daughter-in-law, and niece in the past.  Beyond the Met Gala, Chopra and Jonas have worn Lauren's designs on several occasions. After announcing their engagement this summer, the couple attended Ralph Lauren's 50th Anniversary celebration together during New York Fashion Week in September.  The couple is tying the knot with traditional Indian and Christian wedding ceremonies in Jodhpur, India during a multi-day celebration with family and friends this weekend. The wedding is slated to take place at the stunning Taj Umaid Bhawan Palace in Jodhpur and will likely host a slew of star-studded celebrity guests. Now, excuse me as I obsessively refresh Chopra and Jonas' Instagram feeds for the next 48 hours.

 And her reaction to walking in the same show as Kaia Gerber was priceless. It's been over a week since Versace reunited original '90s supermodels on its Spring 2018 runway, but we're still swooning over the catwalk surprise. In a new interview, Cindy Crawford explained what it was like when she, Naomi Campbell, Claudia Schiffer, Helena Christensen and Carla Bruni joined Donatella Versace in that epic finale. The reunion took Crawford back to her early days of modeling, which she remembers "like it was yesterday," she told The Telegraph. "I haven‚Äôt seen Carla in a long time, but the others‚Äîit‚Äôs different if you catch up over lunch to standing there on a runway," she added. "We all feel part of the Versace family, that brand was such an important part of the beginning of my career." What also made the Versace show special was that it marked Crawford's first time walking with her daughter, Kaia Gerber. This marks the 16-year-old's first time walking during fashion month, and she got to share the catwalk with some runway legends.  "I was booked before Kaia‚ÄîI don‚Äôt think Donatella [Versace] even knew that Kaia was doing shows and we had been talking for months about how many of us could get there for that tribute to [her brother] Gianni," Crawford explained. "When Kaia got the part she said, 'Wait, are we going out together?'" the mother of two later added with a laugh. "I said, 'I hope not, I don‚Äôt want to stand next to you, I want to stand with the women my age!' It was pretty cool, that probably won‚Äôt happen again, to be in the same show.'" With a supermodel mom, Gerber was exposed to (and became fond of) the modeling industry at a young age. Crawford said her daughter used to "play photoshoot" as a little girl.  "She would come onto the shoots with me, so then if she had a friend over I would dress them up in my clothes and I would do hair and makeup, in five minutes," the super recalled. "I was stylist, hair and make-up and photographer. We have this entrance to our house that has a bridge and that would be their catwalk." Now that she's taking on runways for the first time, Gerber continues to take lessons from her mother, especially when it comes to nailing her walk. "When she decided she wanted to do shows and we agreed, she studied," Crawford explained. "I told her I‚Äôm personally not a fan of the vacant stare and robotic walk‚Äîthat was not how the models of my generation walked. I said I understand that some designers will tell you ‚Äòdon't have an expression,‚Äô but my advice is that I think people love seeing personality." It looks like Kaia took her mom's notes to heart.
 The balloon sleeves on her jacket are incredible. Beyonc√© has looked amazing in every appearance she's made since the twins were born, and this weekend was no exception. Turning up at the Made in America Festival to watch husband Jay Z, and sister Solange perform, Beyonc√© donned a head to toe Gucci look.  Photos of the "Lemonade" singer quickly made it on to social media, highlighting Beyonc√©'s incredible outfit choice. Beyonc√©'s look is actually from the Gucci Cruise 2018, "New Renaissance" line: And not just that: this particular Gucci jacket is inspired by Dapper Dan, who The New York Times report, "magnified luxury brands' logomania to larger-than-life proportions, essentially elevated the knockoff to an art unto itself: fashion as sampling." The New York Times also reported, the "fur-lined piece with balloon sleeves created by Mr. Day in the 1980s made use of the Louis Vuitton logo without the brand's permission." Day was sued at the time for using labels' designs without their permission, but now Gucci has turned to his boutique for inspiration, replicating the balloon sleeves almost identically. To complete the outfit, Beyonc√© is wearing Gucci's Metallic Leather Kingsnake pumps. Sheer Perfection.

 After Giorgio Armani's most recent show at London Fashion Week, Justine Picardie enjoys a rare audience with the reigning king of Italian sophistication. Early in the morning before Giorgio Armani‚Äôs latest couture show in Paris, the maestro is as calm as always, at work with his team in an atelier lined with wardrobe rails of flowing black gowns that make up a significant part of the collection. Every feature is exquisite‚Äîintricate crystal beading and embroidery; clouds of dark feathers; fluid layers of tulle and sinuous velvet‚Äîwhile Mr. Armani, watchful and alert as an orchestral conductor, makes his final adjustments to create an elegant symphony that is the purest expression of his prevailing vision of beauty. At 83, he looks remarkably healthy: tanned, trim, and dressed in his signature uniform of a midnight-blue T-shirt and navy trousers. His steady gaze notices everything‚Äîas soon as we have greeted one another, he has already taken in the details of what I am wearing (flat ballet pumps, a floral chiffon blouse, and jeans). He refers to these almost immediately, when I ask him about his decision to stage his latest Emporio Armani show during London Fashion Week (to coincide with the reopening of his Bond Street store). ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been away from London for quite some time,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThe city has changed, I‚Äôve changed, and fashion has changed. But what has stayed the same is my desire to express myself. Because in this rapidly changing world, you can be influenced, dragged in one direction or another, and lose your own identity. But I have eyes and ears; I look around and listen, and I‚Äôve noticed that you wear jeans in a beautiful way, which maybe 10 years ago you wouldn‚Äôt have done. So this is what it means, this is the London of 2017, 2018. And now I consider London to be more sophisticated, perhaps, than before.‚Äù Sophistication is, of course, the essence of Armani style, ever since he first launched his brand in 1975, with a singularity that has made him that rarest of contemporary designers: the president and owner of his own business‚Äîwith a personal fortune of more than $8 billion‚Äîand a true independent in an era of global conglomerates. And somehow he has made this near impossible feat seem easy, just as he makes his characteristically understated tailoring look effortless. But it‚Äôs worth remembering just how radical this was at the beginning of his career, when he deconstructed the rigid lines of traditional jackets, honing a soft yet streamlined version of androgynous suiting that bestowed a supple grace upon those who chose to wear Armani, whether at work or at play. ‚ÄúWith this collection I wanted to reaffirm the true codes of couture.‚Äù Like Coco Chanel‚Äîa couturier he admires greatly, along with Yves Saint Laurent‚ÄîArmani has an aptitude for creating simplicity that belies the complexity of his talent, inspiration, and ambition. And again like Chanel, the polished surfaces of his self-made empire may also conceal past struggles and hidden depths. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very tough on myself‚Äîeven more so than on those around me,‚Äù he observed in a memoir published in 2015. And his life was challenging from the start, for he was born during the Depression, in July 1934, and grew up under the shadow of Mussolini‚Äôs fascist dictatorship, in the northern Italian city of Piacenza, which suffered intensive bombing during World War II. In his memoir, Armani recalled ‚Äúthe fear of [living in] a bombed-out city, sheltering in cellars,‚Äù and in previous conversations, he has told me about the privations of the war and its aftermath, when ‚Äúthere was no money and nothing to eat.‚Äù The middle child of three, he had an older brother (Sergio, now dead)and a younger sister, Rosanna; his father was employed by a transport company, and then arrested and imprisoned for several months after the war, on charges of having worked for the fascist state. His mother, a housewife who also organized children‚Äôs summer camps, was a beautiful, dignified yet austere presence; a naturally elegant woman, he says, but one to whom outward displays of affection did not come easily. After enduring a long spell in the hospital‚Äîthe result of a childhood trauma during the war, when he was badly burned by an exploding shell‚ÄîArmani nurtured an early ambition to become a doctor. He spent three years studying medicine, followed by two years of compulsory military service, but eventually decided that he needed to get a job to help support his family. He found work at a department store in Milan, La Rinascente, initially as a window dresser, then as a menswear buyer. ‚ÄúThe first time I visited London, I was still working for La Rinascente,‚Äù he recalls, ‚Äúand it was the provocative London of Carnaby Street. I didn‚Äôt speak English, and coming from the Italian suburbs, I was a bit shocked. But I was very struck by it, in a good way.‚Äù Armani eventually moved into fashion design, employed by the Italian textile magnate Nino Cerruti, but it was not until he turned 40 that he felt able to contemplate launching his own brand. And even then, this only came about because of the love and support of his partner, Sergio Galeotti, who encouraged Armani to take the risk of setting up in business. Success was swift, in part because the subtle androgyny of the Armani look proved to be the ideal sartorial choice for a new generation of working women for whom feminism did not preclude fashion. But there was also something else at play in the rise of Armani‚Äîa sexiness that tends to be forgotten by those who dubbed him the king of greige. Consider the integral role played by Armani tailoring in  in which Richard Gere is even more seductive when filmed getting dressed in his softly fitted suits than he is naked. Here, then, are clothes as a second skin, and with a similar intimacy and caressing touch. I wonder too about how Armani‚Äôs own sexual identity may have influenced his work, for he grew up in a period when fascism sought to suppress homosexuality (and even though such persecution is no longer sanctioned by the state in Italy, it is not yet a country that fully embraces gay rights). Certainly there is nothing camp about Armani style; hence, perhaps, the way that his menswear has been used to great effect by Hollywood filmmakers, to suggest the hypermasculinity of gangster roles in  and  but as is also evident in  this may not preclude a subversive homoerotic undercurrent, whatever the apparent intentions of the director. Tragically, Armani‚Äôs rise to success was darkened by Galeotti‚Äôs death from AIDS in 1985. This terrible loss might have seemed insurmountable, given that Galeotti was Armani‚Äôs business partner as well as his life‚Äôs companion and inspiration. But the designer‚Äôs inner strength‚Äîeven a streak of steeliness‚Äîmanifested itself with sufficient intensity to propel the company to even greater heights. ‚ÄúChallenges: I love them more than anything else,‚Äù he wrote in his memoir, though it is also clear that he grieved long and deeply. When I interviewed Mr. Armani two years ago, on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of his company, he observed: ‚ÄúTo be creative, you need to be able to respond to pain. If everything goes well, you get boring.‚Äù All of which makes Armani‚Äîthe man and the brand‚Äîmore complicated than one might at first assume. Just look at the unexpected dash of playfulness that is evident in his work; in this couture collection, for example, there are little knitted hats, and occasional splashes of vivid pink, and a print that suggests a bird in flight, its wings spread wide. ‚ÄúNowadays, everything blends together,‚Äù says Mr. Armani, ‚Äúso with this collection I wanted to create a clear divide, and to reaffirm the true codes of couture, which are sophistication, eccentricity, and uniqueness.‚Äù Eccentricity may seem like a surprising element in an aesthetic famed for its sophistication and elegant restraint, but it‚Äôs nevertheless a key ingredient of Armani style. (Which may explain the presence of a larger-than-life gorilla in Mr. Armani‚Äôs living room on the top floor of his palazzo in Milan, a discarded model from Italy‚Äôs Cinecitt√† film studio that he has given a home.) As the designer himself observes, the clarity of his visual approach is leavened with ‚Äúa touch of modernity and wit.‚Äù Added to these are his imagination and the power of dreams. ‚ÄúMy family was a modest family with modest opportunities,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúso I basically constructed a world for myself. And that‚Äôs why I love this job so much, because it has allowed me to build a world to which I never belonged‚Äîa world that I saw in films, and that I read about in books. I built my own way of being‚Äâ.‚Äù ‚ÄúTo be creative, you need to be able to respond to pain.‚Äù Perhaps surprisingly for someone who claims not to speak English (although he appears to understand everything I say during the course of our conversation, even before it is translated), Mr. Armani is a great fan of British period drama, including  and ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a representation of a world and a way of being that I love very much,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs one way of dressing for breakfast, another for dinner, and clothes depending on the various circumstances that presented themselves throughout the day. But nowadays, you put on something in the morning, and you only take it off when you go to bed at night.‚Äù He looks almost wistful for a moment, as if contemplating this idealized English past has lessened his usual guardedness. And so I ask him, ‚ÄúWhat did you dream about last night?‚Äù ‚ÄúIt was a horrible dream,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI was in New York with some unidentifiable people, and at a certain point I turned around and they weren‚Äôt there anymore. I‚Äôm lost in New York, in a department store that is closing, it‚Äôs raining outside, and I‚Äôm feeling so distressed, completely abandoned.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a recurring dream‚Äîif I told a psychoanalyst about it, they‚Äôd say, ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre scared that people are going to abandon you.‚Äô‚Äâ‚Äù He smiles and adds, ‚ÄúFortunately, I woke up in my own beautiful bedroom.‚Äù ‚ÄúHave you ever had psychoanalysis?‚Äù I ask.‚ÄúI did it myself!‚Äù he replies. Then he says goodbye, with a gentle nod, and his eyes‚Äîsky blue yet grave‚Äîreturn to the task ahead of him: to the rails of enchanting couture gowns, and a waking dream of pure elegance, wherein the continuing search for perfection offers the hope of overcoming each and every fear of loss.

 The fashion was inspired by Black Panther.  Last night, stars came out for the 2nd Annual Wearable Art Gala at Alexandria Ballrooms in Los Angeles. The evening's theme was "From WACO to Wakanda" and the fashion reflected the huge impact Black Panther has had. Here are some of the best looks from the night. 
 The fashion house is making some positive changes.  Burberry is the latest luxury fashion house to ban the use of real fur. In an interview with Business of Fashion, CEO Marco Gobbetti confirmed the brand will no longer use animal fur including rabbit, fox, mink, and Asiatic raccoon fur, as well as angora wool. Newly-appointed creative director Riccardo Tisci also shared the news on Instagram ahead of his Burberry runway debut, writing, "NEW ERA @burberry #modernluxury."   Burberry's existing fur products will be phased out of stores and the brand's ban on fur will be effective immediately, starting with Tisci's first collection at London Fashion Week this September.  The British brand joins a growing list of fashion designers who are opting to halt the use of real fur in their collections. Versace, Gucci, Michael Kors, Tom Ford, Furla, and Givenchy have all recently gone fur-free, joining designers like Stella McCartney, Ralph Lauren, and Vivienne Westwood, who have been fur-free for years.  In addition to going fur-free, Burberry has also promised another important change: to stop burning all unsold goods. The brand came under fire in July when it was revealed that $36.8 million worth of unsold Burberry products had been burned and destroyed in the 2017 fiscal year. Now, Gobbetti vows that the brand will work towards becoming more eco-conscious, addressing that consumers want to shop products that are better for the environment. "We think that modern luxury that doesn't take into account the social and environmental responsibility really has no meaning. Now customers are not happy if you don't care about the environment they live in," Gobbetti said. 
 The designer behind Broadway's ‚ÄòThe Cher Show‚Äô opens up about working with the icon for over five decades.  "What do I do with her?!" Bob Mackie asked when tasked with dressing Cher for an appearance on The Carol Burnett Show with Sonny Bono in 1967. Mackie served as the show's costume designer and the famous duo was guest-starring on a sketch. What started as a styling conundrum led to one of the greatest designer-celebrity collaborations of all time.  Fast forward to 50-plus years later and Mackie is still working with Cher. The designer is responsible for nearly all the looks that transformed the superstar into a fashion icon, from that feathered naked dress at the 1974 Met Gala to that showgirl-inspired look at the 1986 Oscars. So when it came time for someone to design costumes for the Broadway adaptation of Cher's life, The Cher Show, there was only one person for the job: Bob Mackie.  The musical, which debuted in December, features over 600 costumes. Sparkles, feathers, towering headpieces: The Cher Show doesn't just turn back time through the icon's life and career; it also takes you through her fashion evolution, with all new looks designed by the great costumer himself. One of the standout highlights is an incredible fashion show scene (aptly called 'The Bob Mackie number'), which eclipses any rom-com dress-up montage or makeover scene. BAZAAR.com caught up with Mackie to talk designing for The Cher Show, how he first met Cher, and what he thinks of celebrities (ahem, Kim Kardashian) recreating his famous naked dress look today.  "She was guest starring with Sonny on The Carol Burnett Show in the first year of the show [1967]. I looked at the script and they told me Sonny and Cher would be guests and we were doing a Show Boat-themed finale. I said, ‚ÄòWhat am I going to do with Sonny and Cher?!‚Äô At that time, they were wearing fur vests and didn‚Äôt crack a smile too often‚Äîthey were like New Age cavemen. But then she came in for a fitting and she was adorable and just so cute. She wasn‚Äôt very tall, she was 5‚Äô6‚Äîthe same height as Sonny actually. I dressed her all up in these ruffles and she was cute as can be. I just thought, ‚ÄòBoy, I like this girl, this is something.‚Äô A couple years later we started working together again. I would dress her up and it was really fun. I got to know her really well and then they got an offer, after playing Vegas for a couple of years, from CBS to do a summer replacement show. Usually those shows are big flops because nobody watches TV in the summers, but theirs was a huge hit and led to their own weekly show."  "She would have up to 20 costumes for an hour-long show. It might be on camera for 30 seconds or 10 minutes, but she wore lots and lots of clothes so she became this amazing clothes horse. I could get a piece of beautiful matte jersey and we could make her a dress in 10 minutes because her body was incredible to work with. She looked good in so many things, the more interesting and exotic, the better. She said one time, 'I‚Äôm like your fucking Barbie!!'"   On Cher, Diana Ross, and Carol Burnett sharing his designs:  "Diana [Ross] was a good friend of Cher‚Äôs, so every now and then she would be like ‚ÄòOh, I‚Äôm going on The Tonight Show, can I borrow something? You have so many things!‚Äô because she watched The Cher Show. A couple of times she borrowed dresses [from Cher], which I thought was so funny. It‚Äôs interesting because at CBS, Sonny and Cher were in one studio and next door was The Carol Burnett Show, so I would be running back and forth checking things like crazy. The two ladies [Carol and Cher] themselves were almost identical in measurements, but nobody would ever think that. Whenever there was a crazy costume or something specific like a Minnie Mouse costume, I‚Äôd be like 'Oh I made one for Carol years ago, let‚Äôs just rent it from the show.' That happened over and over again." On deciding which of Cher‚Äôs many looks to recreate for the Broadway musical: "She‚Äôs worn so many fun outfits personally, but in the show, very often she doesn‚Äôt leave stage for a long time, so we would do a jacket change or even at one point she gets into her Josephine costume over her jumpsuit. It wasn‚Äôt exactly easy [to fit all the looks in], but it was fun. We had a good time."    "It makes me kind of twitch when I hear them call that the, ‚ÄòBob Mackie number,‚Äô it was so much fun to see. It‚Äôs really interesting watching the audience [during the performance] because there‚Äôs all kinds of different people having the best time: people [who remember] that time and then there‚Äôs a whole bunch of young ones who are excited too. They go crazy over the outfits."  
 "I don‚Äôt think there was a big phenomenon in 1975, but just recently and the last couple of years at the Met Ball. All of a sudden they [celebrities] were coming up to Cher and telling her, 'We were inspired by your dress!' And they‚Äôd go online and look at all these old outfits of hers I designed. I‚Äôd forgotten about most of them!" "[The trend] is so silly. I went with Cher, I was her date to the Met Ball in December 1974. People dressed up then, but not really dressed up like that. She walked in, and there I am standing next to her, and all of the sudden there were like a thousand photographers swarming us. They followed her the entire evening. There was a big dinner and we sat at Diana Vreeland‚Äôs table. It was all very fun and I had things in the exhibit as well, so it was very exciting. It was the Hollywood exhibit and there were lots of movie and TV clothes. I look at those pictures now and I look like I‚Äôm 12!"  "I don‚Äôt know her at all. I‚Äôve never met her, so ‚Ä¶ You know, it‚Äôs fine. It‚Äôs very inspiring, one half-Armenian girl to another."   On one of his most memorable outfits for Cher: "It was very exciting when the 1975 TIME magazine came out and it had her on the cover in her see-through dress. It had been seen in Vogue magazine, but nobody reads Vogue like they read TIME, especially when it‚Äôs on the cover. All of a sudden, the magazine was banned in some cities across the country. It sold out some places in like half an hour. It was really crazy." This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.  The Cher Show is now playing on Broadway at the Neil Simon Theater.

 It's a favorite of another royal.  The new Duchess of Sussex broke yet another clothing designer's website yesterday. Meghan Markle made her first appearance as a royal highness in a ladylike rose pink dress by Goat at a garden party honoring her new father-in-law, Prince Charles. Following her new royal protocols, the Duchess held on to a tiny clutch (instead of her beloved shoulder bags) and even wore hosiery for the first time for a royal engagement.  This quintessential British brand, which launched in 2001 by founder and designer Jane Lewis, has been a bit under the radar to those of us stateside. What initially started out as a cashmere range, eventually expanded into a full ready-to-wear line. The clothes exude a timelessness with a focus on craftsmanship.  "For me, it's all about making luxury look effortless. I prize style over fashion always, because it endures," Lewis wrote on her website.  From floral frocks to beaded-collar dresses and chic suiting, Goat does have a regal quality to it upon closer inspection. So it's no wonder that even Markle's sister-in-law, the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Middleton has been a fan of the brand for some time. Kate was first spotted wearing Goat last year, and several times throughout her pregnancy with her latest little prince.  Over the years Goat has quietly amassed a major celebrity following including Victoria Beckham, Lana del Rey, Sienna Miller and Gwyneth Paltrow. However, with the Markle Sparkle in full effect we imagine there will be many more sold-out styles in their future. If you missed out on the Duchess' pink frock the brand has lots of other styles to offer at goatfashion.com. SHOP

 From his start as Pierre Balmain's assistant to his immense influence at Chanel, we're looking back at some of the late designer's greatest moments.  Prolific designer Karl Lagerfeld has passed away at the age of 85, but he leaves behind an impressive legacy. From his start in fashion as Pierre Balmain's assistant back in 1955, to the astounding impact he made after taking over Chanel in 1983, Lagerfeld's varied career has encompassed so many highlights.  Here, a look back at his most important accomplishments: On December 11, 1954, Lagerfeld won first prize in the coat category in a competition organized by the International Wool Association in Paris.  Per Yahoo!, Lagerfeld's success in the competition helped to establish him within the industry, and led to his job as Pierre Balmain's assistant in 1955. Following his initial success in the fashion industry, Lagerfeld quickly secured a role as the art director of  Jean Patou in Paris. According to the Business of Fashion, Lagerfeld was involved in designing "ten haute couture collections" for the brand during his time there. While several sources cite 1958 as when Lagerfeld joined Jean Patou, the designer's official website lists 1957 as his start date. According to Karl Lagerfeld's official website, the designer became one of the first freelancers in the fashion industry, and spent his time working between France, Italy, England, and Germany. He worked with brands including Charles Jourdan, Curiel, Krizia, and Valentino. Lagerfeld also worked with Italian fashion house Tiziani for several years in the '60s. The label designed many of Elizabeth Taylor's movie costumes and red carpet looks. Importantly, Lagerfeld began to freelance at French fashion house Chlo√©, before taking "sole creative control" in 1966, per WWD. Lagerfeld designed the fashion house's collections from 1964 to 1983, and again from 1992 to 1997. Lagerfeld's collaboration with Fendi began in 1965, and continued until his death. According to WWD, the fashion icon became "head designer for its ready-to-wear and fur collections," completely revitalizing the brand.  The Guardian reports that Lagerfeld produced more than 100 collections for Fendi over a 54-year period. His impact upon the brand will not be forgotten. Here he is photographed in 2004, taking the runway for Fendi during Milan Fashion Week. Lagerfeld appeared in Andy Warhol's film L‚ÄôAmour, some of which was filmed in the designer's Parisian apartment, per The Guardian. Here, Lagerfeld (center) is photographed at Le Palace nightclub with a group including Andy Warhol and Paloma Picasso. Lagerfeld is "dubbed the first designer to launch a fragrance without having his own label," GQ reports, proving him to be a trailblazer in every field.  1983 was an important year for Lagerfeld as he became Chanel's chief artistic director.  The designer would completely transform the brand, and create a lasting legacy at the French fashion house. Lagerfeld has since been recognized for growing Chanel "into a $10 billion global fashion machine," per Bloomberg. He is also responsible for interlocking Chanel's "CC" logo, according to GQ, an emblem which is now synonymous with the brand. The designer told The New Yorker in 2007 that he took the role at Chanel precisely because so many people warned him not to. Lagerfeld explained, "Everybody said, ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt touch it, it‚Äôs dead, it will never come back.‚Äô But by then I thought it was a challenge." Alongside his ongoing responsibilities at Fendi and Chanel, Lagerfeld launches his own line. The designer revealed his eponymous label was created to channel "intellectual sexiness,"  GQ writes. Lagerfeld sold the label to the Tommy Hilfiger group in 2005, per Business of Fashion, but retained his role as its chief creative.  Lagerfeld's photography became just as renowned as his design work, with the artist regularly creating photo shoots for Harper's BAZAAR. Of Lagerfeld's impeccable work creating campaigns, editorials, and imagery for Chanel, the image director of the fashion house, Eric Pfrunder, told WWD in October 2015, "Karl has an eye. He‚Äôs not taking 300 shots. He‚Äôs doing five, maybe six. Generally, it‚Äôs the first frame that is the best. He‚Äôs very fast because he has one vision, and that‚Äôs it." A retrospective of Lagerfeld's photography ran in Paris in 2015. Lagerfeld opened 7L in Paris as a destination for fashion art, including books about haute couture, textiles, and jewelry. It also stocks publications produced by the designer and featuring his work, and volumes relating to other topics he was passionate about, including landscapes and cookery. According to his official website, Lagerfeld lost 93 lbs following a strict diet. He released a book in 2004 detailing his weight-loss method, written with his physician, Jean-Claude Houdret.  Introducing The Karl Lagerfeld Diet, the legendary designer revealed the reason for his lifestyle changes: "I suddenly wanted to dress differently, to wear clothes designed by Hedi Slimane‚Ä¶ But these fashions... required me to lose at least eighty pounds... I did not think that it was possible to lose so much weight in one year... In fact, it took me exactly thirteen months."  Lagerfeld was the first high-end designer to collaborate with H&M on an affordable collection‚Äîa move which has inspired an impressive slate of other designers since (like Alexander Wang, Balmain, and Erdem). His collection, unsurprisingly, sold out within seconds. In 2010, Lagerfeld was honored with The Fashion Visionary award from the Couture Council of New York's Fashion Institute of Technology.  He was also bestowed with the Commander's Cross of the Legion of Honor (Croix de Commandeur de la Legion d'Honneur) by the French President Nicolas Sarkozy in June 2010 (pictured).  Lagerfeld collaborated with Net-a-Porter for new line, KARL, which launched online in 2012. Described as "a collection of covetable downtown classics," Fashionista said the affordable line had "a rock'n'roll/street vibe with a healthy dose of leather." Lagerfeld is awarded the Outstanding Achievement Award at the British Fashion Awards. Announcing the award, Natalie Massenet MBE said, ‚ÄúKarl Lagerfeld defines outstanding. He is the champion of excellence, the master of the exceptional and one of the most iconic figures globally from our industry." Here, the designer is photographed with the creative director of Balmain, Olivier Rousteing, at the London Coliseum for the British Fashion Awards. Lagerfeld took home an incredible accolade in 2017. He was awarded the Grand Vermeil medal, which is the highest honor in Paris, at Chanel's Fall 2017 couture show. Here, the designer is photographed receiving the medal from the Mayor of  Paris, Anne Hidalgo. In December 2018, Lagerfeld walked the runway at Chanel's M√©tiers d‚ÄôArt 2018/19 show at The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. Lagerfeld walked with godson Hudson Kroenig, and Virginie Viard, who is taking over the designer's role at Chanel. It would be his final appearance on the Chanel runway. Lagerfeld's contributions to the fashion world will never be forgotten.

 A major '90s supermodel moment at the royal wedding.  From Demi Moore to Ricky Martin, Princess Eugenie's royal wedding to Jack Brooksbank today was filled with a bout of unexpected celebrity appearances. But taking the guest list up another level, Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell were also in attendance, bringing a little '90s supermodel magic to the ceremony.  Arriving separately, both Kate and Naomi opted for some high fashion looks for the wedding. Naomi wore a stunning Ralph & Russo dress, black leather gloves, and a sculptural black fascinator. Giving off some major shine, the sparkling tweed dress featured feather detailing and a metallic cage-like bodice.  Kate, on the other hand, rocked a black and white polka dot look with a black fascinator and veil.  Kate Moss is inside the chapel#RoyalWedding pic.twitter.com/aSuBk9J2Vw The supermodel brought her 16-year-old daughter, Lila Moss, as her date to the wedding. Just last week, Lila made her modeling debut as the new face of Marc Jacobs Beauty. For today's wedding, the teenager wore a pale pink dress and a matching floral headband. Topping off her look, she opted for a glam black fur jacket.  As Eugenie and Jack's vows unfolded in St. George's Chapel, Kate was up front and center, appearing directly behind the happy couple during the ceremony. And as we all know, it's not a proper British wedding unless Kate Moss is giving her blessing in the background.  Imagine having Kate Moss overseeing your wedding just imagine pic.twitter.com/zo12QyAnN4 Neither Naomi nor Kate was in attendance at Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding back in May. Given their very fashun looks at Eugenie and Jack's nuptials today, a royal wedding and '90s supermodel mashup is the pairing we didn't know we needed.

 The brand also unveiled a new logo.  Valentino is taking fashion's love for athleisure to the next level. The brand is opening sport-themed pop-up shops in New York, Milan, Hong Kong, and Tokyo to sell its athletic-inspired Resort 2018 collection, which creative director Pierpaolo Piccioli presented in May. The interiors are designed to resemble chic gyms, and training spaces. (A release from the brand even teases "imaginary basketball nets.") In addition to the resort range, the pop-ups will also be selling sports gear, including basketballs, sneakers, yoga mats, and tracksuits.  The limited-edition items are all marked with a new logo, "VLTN," which was inspired by old Valentino logos in the '80s and '90s, according to WWD. Take a look at some of the athletic gear below: In addition to the standalone pop-up stores, there will also be pop-up installations selling the merch and Resort 2018 collection at Maxfield in Los Angeles, The Webster in Miami, Harrods in London, TsUM in Moscow, and Shinsegae Gangnam in Seoul.

 The trend is still going strong this season.  Thanks to the dadcore trend that flourished after several Prada and Off-White shows‚Äîthink chunky trainers, college sweatshirts, and slouchy trousers‚Äîeasy street-inspired pieces have become a mainstay in our sartorial rotations. Somewhere along the lines, we graduated from thick soles to fanny packs, taking the trend to another level.  The resurgence of every dad/tourist's favorite accessory has been spotted everywhere, and we can't get enough. Whether you call it the waist bag, fanny pack, bum bag or belt bag, this is how to style it for Fall 2019.  Blazers are no longer exclusive to the office; they work for off-duty styling just as well. Add another layer of dimension with a patterned or logo belt bag that can also be worn across your shoulder.   This is my Count down to wool and faux fur being a thing of the past in a very short while #spring #latex #topshopstyle A post shared by  Ada (@ada_oguntodu) on Feb 26, 2019 at 10:09am PST The trench coats of now aren't just cotton or wool; they exist in sleek, modern fabrics like PVC and vinyl. Add some texture and detail to your look by pairing a futuristic trench with a croc-embossed fanny pack.   Fall and winter outfits can easily become a myriad of black, gray, and browns, causing looks to feel a bit repetitive. Break up the neutrals with a bright fanny pack in a luxe fabric.  ü•ê @pompeiibrand A post shared by  Lucia Cuesta (@luciacuesta_) on Feb 25, 2019 at 4:28am PST For errand running and grocery hauls that require both hands, try styling your luxe mini belt bag with an easy white T-shirt, raw-hem jeans, and sneakers.  Kaia Gerber is the queen of leather on leather, and that's clear in this street style shot of her styling a patent leather belt bag with leather trousers and combat boots.

Style loose-fitting tailored separates with a simple canvas fanny pack for an effortless look.  Whether spotted, dotted, leopard, or plaid, prints are in full force for Fall 2019 and will likely carry you into the dead of winter. Go matchy matchy by doubling up on prints and adding a fanny pack with a similar hue.   Old wardrobe treasures A post shared by  Pernille Teisbaek (@pernilleteisbaek) on Jun 22, 2019 at 7:23am PDT You can't go wrong with a one-stop fix-all jumpsuit, especially during the beginning of fall. Cinch the waist on a looser silhouette with a lux fanny pack.   Neutrals for fall? Groundbreaking. Actually, yes. Wearing different shades of the same camel color can effortlessly elevate your look. Style a chestnut leather fanny pack with a matching trench and trousers. Then, break up the tones with a brighter turtleneck.  Belt bags can also be worn as waist belts; ideal for cinching the middle of a loose fitting or oversized silhouette. Use one to flatter and streamline your shape, or show off your curves.

Comfort over errrrting. #breezy @love_amika üçÇ A post shared by  Bianca Valle (@vbiancav) on Sep 25, 2018 at 12:02pm PDT Not all fanny packs are micro bags‚Äîsome come in larger iterations that work for errand running, work bags, and weekend beauty holders. Style yours with cozy fall favorites like a chunky knit and marigold-hued trousers. 
 See the boots, skirts, tops, and pants that all the Insta girls are wearing... While tiger print and leopard print are going still strong, we're feeling a subtler approach to animal print‚Äîand so are many of our sisters in social media. While the 'gram has gone increasingly beige recently with the proliferation of fashion accounts that favor a concise palette of brown, tan, and white‚Äîwith that came a more creative and textural approach to these hues. Enter: the snakeskin print. On pants, dresses, and tops, it maintains a neutral disposition while adding an interesting pattern. As a bonus, you get all of the appeal of snake with none of the guilt‚Äîthis is a print after all, not the real deal.  Christie of NYCBambi pairs MSGM trousers with a camel coat and white boots for a streamlined look with high impact.  These are the pi√®ce de r√©sistance of the snakeskin movement‚Äîthe ideal way to leverage your basics into something that makes an entrance. We're especially on board for the knee-height snake boot that the brand Paris, Texas recently reissued after it sold out this fall thanks to super-fan Emily Ratajkowski rocking the boot all over town.    Print on print on print @petarpetrovvienna @boyyboutique üì∏ @kirstinsinclair #petarpetrov A post shared by  Tiffany Hsu (@handinfire) on Sep 30, 2018 at 10:50pm PDT  Details A post shared by  Sophia Roe (@sophiaroe) on Jan 6, 2019 at 4:49am PST   Ladies like Sophia Roe and Tiffany Hsu are mixing prints and pairing their snakeskin with leather pieces for the ultimate luxe experience. Another chic way to bring some snakeskin into your style game is a full dress or skirt. While statement-making, it's still discrete enough for minimalists to get behind. We love a snakeskin print skirt with a cashmere knit and boots.  Still here, Waiting for 2019 A post shared by  D√©bora Rosa (@deborabrosa) on Dec 26, 2018 at 11:41am PST  D√©bora Rosa nails the idea, mixing her snake skirt with black separates.    A great silk snakeskin print button-down gives perfect '90s Gucci vibes, just keep the buttons undone at the top‚Äîand maybe add in a gold pendant necklace.  Imani wears her Sandy Liang top as a dress, adds white boots, and slays the whole idea. We also love Equipment's classic take on the look.

 Beanie season is almost upon us.  As the evenings get colder and the mornings become brisker, we know that fall fashion is just around the corner. For the street style circuit, it's one of the best sartorial times of the year; the more clothes, the better! Beyond wide-brim hats and vinyl baker boy caps, the beanie is a classic way to stay warm and look chic during the colder months. But what's the best way to wear one? Ahead, look to these well dressed women for the ultimate beanie styling inspiration.   A beanie is a functional winter must-have that goes with more looks than you'd think. Play with the streetwear aesthetic of now by adding a fitted beanie to a modern leather trench and sneaker pairing.  If comfort and coziness is what you're after, you'll love this unisex beanie from¬†Ma'ry'ya. Made of 100% cashmere, this accessory will feel luxurious to the touch.¬† This iteration from Parisian brand Ami Alexandre Mattiussi¬†is crafted in beige wool with a playful contrasting heart patch adorning the front.¬† You can never go wrong with a neutral wool coat, graphic T-shirt, and light-wash denim.  This outfit formula is effortless, probably already exists in your closet, and looks even better when worn with a classic black beanie.  Acne Studios always nails cold-weather essentials, so it's no surprise that the brand's take on the classic beanie is a fashion-girl favorite. This cashmere beanie from British label Madeleine Thompson¬†is both chic and functional, making it an easy addition to your fall and winter rotation.¬† Not only is a beanie the perfect way to keep your ears warm, it's also an easy way to incorporate color into an otherwise neutral ensemble.  Add a pop of color with a baby pink, orange or powder blue hat. This statement-making hat will leave you feeling nostalgic for fall mornings in high school. Keep it modern and adult-appropriate with tailored separates.¬† For a subtle soft pink and a pop of bright¬†color, look to this option from¬†New York based designer¬†Duffy.¬† Mix and match fabrics, colors, and volume for a more dimensional look.  To keep things semi-streamlined, opt for a beanie that matches one of the hues in your outfit.   This forest green beanie works as a neutral for all your seasonal looks.¬† Head-to-toe black is a city girl styling favorite‚Äîeverything matches, and the versatility is endless.

For added playfulness and warmth, look to Sophia Cashmere's ultra cozy pom-pom option, complete with ribbing for texture.¬† For a more luxe option, there's Valentino's logo beanie to add a little pop to your fall and winter looks.¬† What's more elegant than all white winter outerwear? Not much. Leave it to Pernille Teisbaek to give us the seasonal inspiration we crave. Style your matching beanie with a belted soft trench.  Made from Italian cashmere, this beanie¬†features a slightly rolled hem for a more detailed approach.¬† This form-fitting beanie is ideal for showcasing wavy locks or a sleek new blunt bob cut. Add dangling earrings and a bold lip to contrast against the color.¬† Creams, grays, and maroons look sophisticated when styled together. Pair your grey beanie with a chunky cream knit layered over a side-slit sweater dress. Then, add a statement knee-high boot.  This cozy beanie is fitted with a logo patch, making it a staple cold weather accessory.¬† Craving some Balenciaga but don't want to hand over your entire wallet? Look to this luxe logo beanie from the brand, crafted from super-soft wool and camel hair in a light gray.¬†
 Someone get this woman a DayQuil campaign!! Some of us look like gross, sweaty human piles of tissues while battling a high fever. And then there is Bella Hadid, who looks like...Bella Hadid.  Despite having a 101-degree fever, the model is currently walking Paris Fashion Week after modeling runways in New York, London, and Milan. Before closing the shows of both Redemption and Off-White today, Bella took to Instagram Stories to reveal she was feeling under the weather. "101 fever is not cute when walking a runway," she wrote while snapping a selfie in the back of a car.  Regardless of what her Instagram post said, we can confirm that Bella did, however, look extremely "cute" while walking the runways with a fever. Exhibit A: still serving face while donning this dramatic yellow checked look at the Off-White show. Exhibit B: leading the finale walk at Redemption in a fierce sparkling look with an even fiercer walk. I mean, do you see this hair flip? Bella is not here for this fever!!! She is slaying regardless of what any thermometer has to say. This is a level of unbothered professionalism we should all aspire to. The top model has starred in campaigns for Fendi, Dior Beauty, Moschino, and Calvin Klein, to name a few. But someone please cast this woman as the new face of DayQuil ASAP!  Feel better, Bella. You're doing amazing, sweetie!  closing @redemptionofficial this afternoon . thank you for having me, fever and all @johndavidpfeiffer @babethdjian üñ§ A post shared by  Libragrl999ü¶ã (@bellahadid) on Feb 28, 2019 at 11:48am PST
 You'll want a pair of these babies ASAP. Louis Vuitton jumped on the dad shoe trend back in October when it debuted clunky yet high-arched sneakers on the Paris runways. Following the launches of Balenciaga's Triple S, Yeezy's Wave Runner and Nike's revamped VaporMax, Nicolas Ghesqui√®re sent models down the catwalk in Vuitton's own Archlight trainers with 18th-century brocade coats, deconstructed dresses and even a Stranger Things tee.  Four months later, the cool shoe will finally be available to shop worldwide on February 23, but before then, the French fashion house is opening a pop-up store completely dedicated to the footwear. The temporary storefront is located in SoHo, NYC, and fittingly opens today, the first official day of Fashion Week. The pop-up will stay open until March 10.  The Vuitton pop-up will likely be a hot spot for fashionistas during NYFW and for trendy young hypebeasts for the rest of the month it's open. The post will also mark the only Archlight-dedicated pop-up in the world. To make it even more special, an exclusive all-black design (a contrast to the white and pastels in the rest of the collection) will be sold only in the store. The shoe retails for $1,040.

 She made her runway debut at Gypsy Sport.  Although Madonna is no stranger to the fashion world (or any world, for that matter), her daughter, Lourdes Leon, has managed to keep somewhat of a low-key profile over the years. But tonight, all that changed when the 21-year-old made her big runway debut at New York Fashion Week.    Walking in Gypsy Sport's Spring 2019 show, Lourdes wore a beaded shell chain bra, extremely ripped low-rise jeans (with black underwear peeking out √† la the early 2000s), and chunky dad sneakers. Topping it all off, her runway look was accessorized with ultra-tiny sunglasses and a leafy palm hairpiece.  While this may be her catwalk debut, this isn't Lourdes' first time attending New York Fashion Week. Back in September 2016, she sat front row alongside her mom at Alexander Wang's Spring 2017 show and later attended the #WangFest after-party. This isn't the first time she's dipped her toes into the modeling world either. Previously, Lourdes starred in ad campaigns for Stella McCartney's Pop fragrance and Converse's MadeMe collaboration.  Born in 1996, Lourdes is Madonna's eldest child, whom she shares with Carlos Leon. Lourdes most recently attended her mom's alma mater, the University of Michigan. Along with her oldest daughter, the Queen of Pop also has five other children: 18-year-old son Rocco Ritchie, whose father is Guy Ritchie, and four children whom she adopted from Malawi: 12-year-old David, 12-year-old Mercy James, and 6-year-old twins, Estere and Stella.

 Inspired by her annual trip to Tuscany. Rosetta Getty is a bonafide travel expert. She not only has houses around the world and vacations at the same sprawling villa in Tuscany (a Getty family tradition for over 50 years), but travelled the globe extensively during her years as a model.  Suffice to say, she has the art of packing down to a science. So much so, that the designer known for creating minimal, elegant pieces that have some sort of ultra flattering and cool twist, decided it was time to create a capsule collection focused entirely on vacation-ready clothing, inspired by her annual trip to Tuscany.  Comprised of 15 different pieces ranging from wide leg palazzo pants, a simple (and quite perfect) little white dress, a cutout cropped top that could work for almost every occasion and pares back with everything, and a slew of other multifunctional items. Each piece is made with the intention to be worn multiple ways, and for many different activities throughout your travels. Looking chic on the plane? Easy. Need something to take you from breakfast to the pool to the market back to cocktail hour? You'll find it. As a first for the designer, the capsule collection launches today on rosettagetty.com, and ranges in price from $250 to $1,700. "I found myself packing the same pieces every summer, which naturally made me think of reworking existing styles into a timeless travel capsule," says Getty. Here, the designer also shares her travel tips‚Äîfrom what to pack on the plane to her favorite beauty products. A few hours before traveling I try to find some time to meditate, even if it's only for 10 or 15 minutes. It‚Äôs always so hectic getting ready for a flight, but I find meditation very calming. It makes me feel tranquil and ready for what‚Äôs ahead. I normally wear a pair of white sneakers (Balenciaga sock sneakers) and trousers from my line. They have an elastic waistband, so they‚Äôre comfortable enough for the plane and yet they still look tailored and put together. Our classic mercerised cotton t-shirts and soft cashmere sweaters are a few other essentials that I always carry with me, as well as a pair of cashmere socks from Loro Piana or Brunello Cucinelli. C√©line sunglasses, Byredo travel perfume and case, Joelle Ciocco intensive eye care, Altoids peppermint mints, Rodin lip balm, travel size Marvis toothpaste, Mason Pearson brush, Muji sketchbook and pen, and Matt‚Äôs Munchies mango snacks. While on the plane, I dedicate half of my time to catching up on the latest issue of Harper‚Äôs BAZAAR, Porter or Architectural Digest, and then I switch to something more substantial like The New Yorker. When on holiday, I pack a few books to read (Joan Didion and Susan Sontag are favorites) but I‚Äôm always too ambitious and end up spending most of the time with my four kids. My ‚Äúon-plane‚Äù ritual for a long flight includes washing my face as soon as we take off, followed by an hourly moisturizing ritual. I pack Shiva Rose oil and put it on my face every hour or so. For me, hydration is key when on the plane. A few of my other favorite products are La Mer face cream, Rodin body oil, and Dr. Hauschka Hydrating Hand Cream‚Äîit‚Äôs the best! Also, I always bring two big bottles of Fuji water, and although I don‚Äôt wear much jewelry, I‚Äôm always wearing my Cartier diamond solitaire (c1930) that was a gift from my husband on our 15th wedding anniversary. After a few hours go by, I have mint tea (which is really soothing), and before landing I might change my top or put on a smart jacket. It‚Äôs very simple! Roll everything up in your luggage, bring a great dry shampoo‚ÄîI love the one the Ouai makes‚Äîand drink tons of water.
 The footwear designer talks "red bottoms" and "bloody shoes." Cardi B's breakout hit "Bodak Yellow" is officially the number one song in the country. The rap track‚Äîwhose most quotable lyric is arguably the shoutout to Christian Louboutin's scarlet soles: "These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes"‚Äîhas swept the nation, topping the Billboard Hot 100 for the second week in a row. It was only a matter of time before the footwear designer heard it himself, and he has. A friend recently played the song and the video for Louboutin and pointed out the lyrics, he told the New York Times. He's still new to Cardi, though, and struggled to remember who she was in his interview. "She‚Äôs a rapper? This 'Yellow' song?" he asked NYT. "I don‚Äôt know much more than that, to be honest." Hey, it's a start. Cardi (born Belcalis Almanzar) got her first pair of red bottoms from a fan during her days as a stripper. Now, the rapper apparently owns over 90 pairs. "She usually buys a pair or two every couple of weeks," her stylist recently told Billboard. Her connection to the shoe relates to Louboutin's early design days, too. "The first shoes I ever designed were for showgirls, people on stage. Showgirls have a kind of attitude ‚Äî they‚Äôre driving forces," he told the Times, recalling his internship under Folies Berg√®re. Though the designer doesn't consider himself a "big rap person," he's still open to meeting Cardi if she's ever in town. "Why not?" he said.  Not that's a collab we're dying to see.
 In this new BAZAAR series‚ÄîThis Look Is Money‚Äîwe‚Äôre hitting the streets to find the best dressed and the big spenders. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window.

This week bring us to South Korea's capital city for Seoul Fashion Week, where we caught up with three SFW models (Hyeon Seo, Hanna Jang, and Ji Hyun Park) to find out exactly what pieces they wear off the runway, then calculated the total cost of their full street style ensembles. From the $250 versatile navy Tomboy overcoat paired with layered affordable knits from Zara, to a simple white button-up top styled alongside gifted $600 Saint Laurent-designed canvas kicks‚Äîthese girls prove they've mastered the art of high-low fashion. Watch the video above to see these money looks straight out of Seoul, or tune in to the video below, where we calculate the true cost of the best show-stopping street style ensembles from New York Fashion Week.
 Start shopping this season's office must-haves now.  When it comes to fall dressing, transitional looks that can carry you from the office to an evening dinner with friends are essential. With new autumnal pieces dropping every day, it's time to start building up your wardrobe with staple, but fashion-focused items that you can comfortably wear on your commute, in your frigid office, and beyond. Get inspired and re-imagine your work wardrobe with these chic outfit ideas and the key pieces to recreate them. A blazer stands as the reigning work wardrobe staple, and for good reason. The classic piece comes in various prints, hues, and fabrics, making it easy to mix and match throughout the week.  A burgundy blazer adds a fresh update to your closet of black, white, and gray¬†essentials. Plus, this color is basically a neutral.¬† During the fall season, turtlenecks become a go-to. Play with rusted tones and textures when you get dressed in the morning. The turtleneck is also perfect for freezing office temperatures and hair tucking.  Everything about this turtleneck screams "chic," from the fabric, to the color, to the ribbing details.¬† Tie-dye is a fun, seasonless trend that doesn't have to be exclusive to your weekend plans. Play with the print during the work week by layering it beneath your blazer.  This pretty tie-dye tee from up-and-coming cool-girl brand Little High, Little Low will look sophisticated underneath a blazer. The Purple Haze tee's come in a variety of unique shades and psychedelic prints.¬† You can't go wrong with the right pair of loose fitting trousers, especially in black. Go for a wide-leg, oversized silhouette in a cotton-blend or wool fabric.   This affordable black pant from Topshop is eternally put-together, and can be worn with sneakers, pumps, or heeled boots.¬† Unless you're in a fashion industry office, having on too many jewels and baubles can be a bit too over-the-top. Instead, opt for the perfect pair of gold hoops to spice up any suiting look.  Not too big, not too small, and not too pricey.¬† Button down shirts are nothing new, but they can be modernized when worn as a layering piece. Wear your favorite black turtleneck underneath for added interest and easy trouser tucking.  Burberry's crisp iteration gives a whole new meaning to understated luxury.¬† The Bermuda short resurgence was one we didn't expect, but we're happily embracing the trend for workwear and beyond. Ditch your favorite jeans and try on a pair these utilitarian staples.  These longline shorts are cut from vegan-friendly leather, and sit on your hips in a relaxed shape. Make a serious statement with a camel-hued chunky sweater.¬† Before you discard your favorite summer midi dress, think again. Adding a blazer over and layering some work-appropriate trousers beneath adds a new element of cool to every work ensemble.   The perfect summer dress for layering into fall.¬† Style an oversized blazer over a bright pleated skirt for an proportional juxtaposition between womenswear and menswear.  Our favorite pleated skirts of today come in varying colors, shapes and hemlines.¬† White footwear can be worn year-round, and they're  a chic way to break up darker tones during the fall and winter.  This white bootie from cult-favorite brand Dear Frances offers a comfortable heel height and a sleek, creamy off-white tone.¬† Utilitarian trousers or cargo-inspired pants allow you to take a break from wool trousers or denim, which is especially appropriate for an office setting.  The utilitarian pants of today aren't the ones your camp counselor wore in the early 2000's. When worn with a black turtleneck, they become an easy styling piece.¬† A good knitwear piece in a neutral tone can truly carry you throughout fall and winter. Sweaters are fantastic layering options; whether over midi dresses or underneath double breasted blazers.  Let this cozy cashmere knit become your go-to sweater.¬† Trench coats have become a street style staple and a model off-duty go-to because of its durability despite rain, sleet or frigid cold.  This trench is light enough to wear at the beginning of fall and heavy enough to protect you from the rain.¬† A leather trouser or leather jumpsuit is an easy, unexpected way to enhance a classic blazer look.  It's both parts work appropriate and fashion-forward.¬† Put aside your neutral trousers and opt for a plaid pair that'll make such a statement, a T-shirt, turtleneck or basic sweater will suffice.  These stunning trousers will bring new life to every work week uniform.¬†
 Kim praised her as "The OG." Last night, you might've seen multiple Kim Kardashians on your Instagram feed. A select group of Kardashian-Jenner friends, celebrities and influencers modeled Kanye West's Yeezy Season 6 collection by recreating the paparazzi shots where Kim first debuted the looks (styled by Carine Roitfeld) in December. The result was a complete, Yeezy-fied social media ambush inspired by one of the internet's most famous users. #Yeezy pic.twitter.com/ls7voophEl The Kim clones included Kylie Jenner's best friend Jordyn Woods, former Yeezy Season 4 model Amina Blue and model and Jaden Smith's ex Sarah Snyder‚Äîyour classic Instagram cool girls.

 Ooh la la, Dior, Chanel, Givenchy, et plus... We're in the final quarter of fashion month‚Äîwith so many major runways left to see. See the best looks from the best shows happening in the City of Light. From Dior all the way to Chanel, Loewe, and Vuitton‚Äîget in losers, we're going to fashion week.  Nicolas Ghesqui√®re went on a colorful and eclectic journey through time for spring. There were references to Art Nouveau, Paris' Belle √âpoque era, and even the Gibson girl. But amidst all the various time periods, colors (the colors!), prints, and silhouettes, there was a modernized stream of cohesion that proved Ghesqui√®re is moving fashion forward, even while looking back.  Virginie Viard is looking to keep the house of Chanel young, fun, and steadfastly Parisian. With a set built to look like the iconic rooftops of Paris, the look was based on Nouvelle Vague or New Wave. Little hats, ultra feminine mini skirts, tweedy two piece suits with cropped pants, and some well-positioned denim brought the '50s look into the now. And plenty of logo dresses will please costumers who like to wear their Chanel loud and proud. While one may not realize just from looking at Sarah Burton's Spring 2020 collection‚Äîbut the creative director took a sustainable approach to her latest offering for Alexander McQueen. She upcycled fabrics used in the past (even from Lee McQueen's days), and sourced fabrics from Ireland, enlisting the help of damask linen weavers and flax farmers. Together, it all created one of the most wearable collections to date but still encompassing that signature handiwork and attention to detail that we've come to expect.  Clare Waight Keller was all about the mix for Spring, citing, ‚Äúfractal symmetries drawn from the botanical world entwine with a tough urban energy. From the blossoms of old-world Paris to the raw denim spirit of New York City.‚Äù That translated to leather trenches, floral gowns, volume, and street vibes. Those street vibes were most apparent in 90s denim, washed and distressed shorts, wide two-tone jeans and column skirts, the result of upcycling.  Pierpaolo Piccioli has won over even the most cynical fashion hearts. Who doesn‚Äôt fall in love all over again over dramatic, clean, pretty white poplin dresses while Frank Ocean croons Moon River over the loudspeakers? There were also bold neon hues on familiar dramatic silhouettes, some purple sparkles, white feathers, a black shorts suit on Kaia Gerber, and an intricate white gown that illicted gasps. 
 They're by Garrett Leight California Optical, and they're available now. Brad Pitt is an exceedingly cool guy. I mean, I don't know him or anything‚Äîthough we can all get to know him a little better in Esquire's new interview with Pitt and his Once Upon a Time...In Hollywood buddies Quentin Tarantino and Leonardo DiCaptrio‚Äîbut the guy exudes an aura of general coolness. And he doubled down on that vibe when he hit the red carpet at Cannes this Tuesday wearing a pair of extremely stylish sunglasses.  Because Pitt is, in addition to being a cool guy, a very famous guy, we're now lucky enough to know the provenance of those sunglasses: They're called the "Calabar," and they're by boutique eyewear brand Garrett Leight California Optical. The Calabar is a riff on the classic wayfarer shape‚Äîbut with a few key changes.    First off, the shape is a little different than the old-school version of the wayfarer. The frames are more squared-off, and the browline isn't quite so flat, dipping at the bridge to give the glasses a new feel. Plus, the temple pieces are toned-down (and inspired by '50s car fins, if you're looking for a conversation-starter). Basically, they feel both retro and modern, which is a very good combo when it comes to sunglasses.  Plus, they're Brad Pitt-approved. Think about it: Once Upon a Time...In Hollywood is one of the summer's biggest releases. Cannes is one of the movie industry's biggest events, and a huge chance for stars to show off their style, to boot. If these sunglasses are good enough for a guy like Pitt at a time like this, they're good enough for your hungover coffee run this weekend.  At $340, the Calabar isn't exactly cheap. But good eyewear is worth the investment. You're wearing it on your face, after all. Don't you want your face to look good? Like, maybe even Brad Pitt good? Just don't forget your pair at the beach‚Äîor on the red carpet of the next gala you attend. Pitt probably wouldn't approve.

 Royals are resourceful too.  Over the weekend, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle treated us all to another royal wedding appearance when they attended the nuptials of Harry's cousin, Celia McCorquodale in Lincolnshire, England.   For the occasion, the Duchess of Sussex channeled her late mother-in-law, Princess Diana, in a blue and white print Oscar de la Renta dress‚Äîwhich is still available to shop. In typical royal wedding guest attire, Meghan topped off her look with a white fascinator and a matching box clutch. But as it turns out, it was her cutout white satin pumps that were most significant.  Oscar de la Renta dress, $5,490, modaoperandi.com. SHOP NOW If the newlywed's shoe of choice looks familiar, it's because she already wore the bespoke satin Aquazzura pumps on her own wedding day (you may remember she married Prince Harry last month in a totally low-key and chill ceremony). Fans behind Meghan's Mirror, a style blog documenting the royal's outfits, were quick to spot the Duchess' accessory repeat.  SHOP SIMILAR AQUAZZURA SHOES Originally, the Duchess of Sussex wore the Aquazzura pumps with her second wedding reception dress by Stella McCartney.  Over the years, her sister-in-law Kate Middleton and Queen Elizabeth II have both become known to recycle outfits and accessories on numerous occasions (as have Prince George and Princess Charlotte). And it looks like the newest addition to the royal family plans to follow suit. 
 We appreciate you, Amal... It's a bittersweet day to be a woman in America.  In D.C., Dr. Christine Blasey Ford put everything on the line‚Äîher reputation, her safety, her privacy‚Äîto testify in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Amidst conversations around her courage and resilience, some women are tweeting about the pressure she must have felt in deciding what to wear: how to have her hair blown out, how much makeup to wear before going in front of the world to be judged, to speak about the darkest moments of her life.  It's complicated, the material aspects of being a woman, but all of those things, what we wear, how we do our hair, what lipstick to choose, or not choose, can be equal parts armor, self-care and, in the best of circumstances, up-lifting.   In New York City, Amal Clooney is appearing daily at UN meetings. To celebrate her unique and polished approach to style is not to undercut her intellect or her mitigate the important work that she does as a human rights attorney. It's to celebrate one aspect of being a woman‚Äîto find the light, ignore the haters.  And that polka dot suit, comprised of a flowing jacket, tied at the waist with a coordinating belt, with a slight ruffle at the sleeve, paired with a matching midi skirt, an oversized black bag (presumably for all of her legal docs) and simple black pumps, is a sartorial winner. It is technically a suit, but wears like a dress. Clooney has become a style icon, synonymous with her elegant style, often compared to Jackie O. This suit may or may not be vintage, but it's certainly vintage-inspired. It doesn't take itself too seriously, which is never to say Clooney doesn't take herself seriously.  The mom of twins kept her beauty look natural, with flowing, slightly curled, impossibly bouncy hair, a touch of blush and a light pink lip. Sapphire and diamond earrings frame her face, her nails are perfectly manicured in a high-shine, deep red hue.  Because being a woman can mean having the option of feeling beautiful and empowered all at once‚Äîand we are grateful to the ones who show up for all of us.

 The designer presented his latest collection in Times Square.  For his last show during the traditional New York Fashion Week calendar, Alexander Wang set up office in Times Square.  Merging together some major '80s Working Girl vibes with the '90s Matrix look, Wang's Fall 2018 collection was presented in the cubicles of the former Conde Nast building at 4 Times Square. Sticking with the corporate vibe, signs reading 'AWG' (the Alexander Wang Group) covered the mock office.  A swift departure from the designer's usual #WANGFEST after party blowout, this season's show meant serious business. The collection was comprised of tailored suiting, leather trenches, deconstructed blazers, and ultra-small sunglasses that looked straight out of The Matrix. Of course, Wang still brought his own signature style to the corporate world with tights bedazzled with "CEO," pink tweed mini skirts, and sweatpants reading "A. Wang Platinum"‚Äîinspired by your office corporate card. Kaia Gerber hit the runway in a sexy, reconstructed blazer dress, but the show also had its fair share of futuristic leather looks mixed in with some of the designer's beloved streetwear.  Plus, Wang achieved the impossible and made tying a knit sweater around your shoulders look cool‚Äîno easy feat.  Along with the small black frames, a bedazzled pair of tiny cat-eye sunglasses hit the runway, an accessory that is sure to take over the street style scene and just about every model off-duty.  Beyond the collection, the beauty look also mirrored the '80s and '90s businesswoman aesthetic with models wearing giant silver claw clips in their hair.  If anyone can bring back the claw clip and the Working Girl look, it's undoubtedly Alexander Wang. 
 A new girl-power fashion collaboration is born for International Women's Month.  In celebration of International Women's Day on March 8th, luxury fashion e-tailer Net-A-Porter is launching a limited-edition female-centered collection in collaboration with six designers, with all proceeds benefitting Women for Women International. The collection features six unique graphic t-shirts designed by Stella McCartney, Ganni, Off White, Bella Freud, Rosie Assoulin, and Chlo√©. Each shirt is an interpretation of the designer's outlook on female empowerment, printed on a fresh cotton tee. The pieces are varied, but hold a common white backdrop and celebratory messages of women supporting women. And our guess‚Äîall will be quick to sell out. Of her gold chain design inspiration, Chlo√©'s creative director, Natacha Ramsay-Levi, said it's a tribute to the symbolic union of femininity. ‚ÄúRecognizing both the universality and individuality of women was behind much of what I wanted to say with my first collection at ChloeÃÅ," Ramsay-Levi explained. "This is what drew me to using a Cycladic totem of femininity, a symbol dating back more than four millenniums, yet still timeless, as a pendant necklace," she continued. "I wanted to translate this message for International Women‚Äôs Day, repeating this symbol in gold thread on the pocket with a matching metallic ring piercing through the sleeve. Together these details represent the life-giving force within all women.‚Äù Designer Bella Freud drew her inspiration from the unifying force of love. ‚ÄúLove is inclusive, it unites us," she said. "Love opens our hearts and minds to go beyond our limitations.‚Äù Though overtly more tongue-in-cheek, Ditte Reffstrup, Ganni's creative director, said his 'Girls on Top' shirt is both good-humored and celebratory. Reffstrup explained that his t-shirt was made for: ‚ÄúAll the amazing girls and women who show the way forward and won‚Äôt be pigeonholed or held back by their gender.‚Äù Rosie Assoulin explained that her 'Do It For Grandma' design was inspired by her familial relationship to women, and the sense of shared history that bonds all of us together. Because really, we all got it from our grand-mamas. "I was inspired by my grandmother, who spoke many languages, and lived in many countries," Assoulin said. "With each brave move she experienced a strange and new place, and her wisdom and experience are invaluable. What our grandmothers lived through, historically and personally, is inspiring, and the equality we are able to fight for today was often unspeakable in their time." Net-A-Porter will donate 100% of the profits from the collection to Women for Women International, which, in its 25-year existence, has equipped more than 462,000 women across eight conflict-affected countries with the resources to break out of poverty and stand up for their rights. It's in the spirit of solidarity and sisterhood that this fashion collaboration is born‚Äîand in today's political climate, we couldn't be more here for it.
 Once again, phresh off the runway.  Rihanna is known to rock looks straight from the runway (she doesn't have a song called "Phresh Out The Runway" for nothing), so it's no surprise that her latest outfit comes right from Off-White's Spring 2018 collection.  Last night, the singer stepped out in the Virgil Abloh-designed look worn by Kaia Gerber on the runway at Paris Fashion Week. Posing in front of a giant framed $100 bill (how else does one show off their new outfit?), Bad Gal Riri wore the full look from the cropped camel jacket down to the white boots.  She accessorized it with a mini Louis Vuitton trunk bag and took to Instagram to share off more photos along with a side profile view because, why not give the people what they want?   And just in case you forgot what it looked like on the Off-White runway, 16-year-old Kaia Gerber wore it during her breakout fashion month:
 And she narrowly avoided a wardrobe malfunction.  Selena Gomez's style is always on point, and her latest outfit is no exception. Heading out to dinner on Friday night in Los Angeles with friends, Gomez opted for a gorgeous satin gown, with a dramatic thigh-high slit.  She paired the dress with a peach and pink Pieced Shearling Bomber by Coach: The singer wore a simple pair of pointy pumps with the gown, and accessorized the outfit with a waist-length necklace. Gomez is rumored to be dating ex-boyfriend Justin Bieber again, and she recently completed a program for depression and anxiety, according to People.  A source told the publication, "She felt like she needed to get away and focus on herself with no distractions. She came back feeling very empowered."

 VS Angel Candice Swanepoel is adding designer to her resume.  We couldn't think of a better authority on swimwear than Candice Swanepoel. The top model, and Victoria's Secret Angel has made a name for herself showing off her famously fit physique. So, it was no surprise today when she announced on Instagram that she'll be launching a swimwear brand of her own.  The brand, called Tropic of C, will be available starting next month and is comprised of '80's inspired one-pieces and Bond Girl-esque two-pieces. She added on her Instagram caption that the brand has been created with "loads of love." The breathtaking beach campaign was photographed at Amanyara in the Turks & Caicos.  The African beauty has a lot to celebrate these days. In December she announced that she's pregnant with her second child just a few weeks after walking the 2017 Victoria Secret Fashion Show in Shanghai. Meaning, yes, she walked the show while pregnant‚Äîalthough her fans were none the wiser.  Swanepoel also shared last week that she is having another boy. Her first child, Anaca was born in October of 2016. Her fellow Angel gal pal Behati Prinsloo is also pregnant for the second time. The two models gave birth to their first children within a month of each other.  Swanepoel was recently photographed spending the holidays in Brazil, where her fiance, Herman Nicoli is from. The beautiful couple was joined by fellow supermodel Doutzen Kroes, husband Sunnery James and their two children.  For now, Swanepoel fans can sign up for updates on topicofc.com to be the first to shop the supermodel's designs. 
 After skipping a season, the singer/designer is returning to the NYFW calendar.  If last season's New York Fashion Week calendar seemed less exciting, it's probably because it was missing Rihanna riding a dirt-bike down the runway. But good news for this September: the singer/designer is making a return to NYFW after sitting last season out.  As WWD reports, not only is Bad Gal Riri slated to show during this season's schedule, she's actually serving as the grand finale of the week. Unlike her previous runways in New York and Paris, she's showing without Puma this time.  Instead, Rihanna will host a Savage x Fenty event, bringing her collection of lingerie to the New York Fashion Week scene for the first time. The presentation, which is set to be an "immersive experience," is slated to take place in Brooklyn at 7:30 PM on Wednesday, September 12, following the Marc Jacobs show at 6:00 PM. Rihanna closing out NYFW in lingerie? Yes, please.  The Savage x Fenty presentation will be shown in a see-now, buy-now format and available to shop immediately at SavageX.com and a series of pop-up shops this fall.  Bad & BOUjee ‚úñÔ∏è| @shabakaaa serving #BLACKWIDOW in the Sheer Marabou Romper A post shared by  SAVAGE X FENTY BY RIHANNA (@savagexfenty) on Aug 20, 2018 at 9:01pm PDT Upon its brand launch in May, the Savage x Fenty website instantly crashed several times due to such high-demand. Featuring bras, underwear, furry robes, and more, Rihanna's line of lingerie and intimate accessories was heralded not only for being affordable, but for being inclusive in terms of sizing. Along with featuring a diverse lineup of models, the collection also boasted a wide range of nude shade options for all skin tones in both bras and underwear.  SHOP SAVAGE x FENTY LINGERIE NOW

 Will the real Carla Bruni please stand up? Supermodel and singer Carla Bruni and top model Bella Hadid have us seeing double. Both ladies are currently in France for the annual Cannes Film Festival, and the pair posed for pictures together during a dinner for Dior last night. When Bruni posted a black and white photo of herself and Hadid in a warm embrace to her Instagram, we had to do a double-take. They're basically twins. Despite both women wearing two distinct outfits‚ÄîHadid in a Dior nude off-the-shoulder top and skirt and Bruni in a Celine by Hedi Slimane black turtleneck‚Äîtheir glam was essentially the same. Both sported face-framing wispy bangs and put their matching brunette hair in an updo.   "With my (slightly younger) sister @bellahadid üòúü¶ãüíïat the @vogueparis x @Dior dinner in Cannes," Bruni captioned her Instagram. "Love you so very much üñ§üñ§üñ§," Hadid responded in the comments section. Bella's mother, Yolanda Hadid, even chimed in, adding two red heart emojis, letting everyone know that she approves of their precious twinning moment.

On May 13, Bruni shared another black and white snapshot of herself and Hadid smizing at the camera during the 2018 Cannes Film Festival. At the time she wrote "Do I have a hidden daughter? ‚ù§Ô∏è @bellahadid" as her caption.  Do I have a hidden daughter? ‚ù§Ô∏è @bellahadid A post shared by  Carla Bruni (@carlabruniofficial) on May 13, 2018 at 2:42pm PDT Perhaps in the future, the two models will continue to use the Cannes Film Festival as their yearly meeting spot to perplex us all with their stunning look-alike features.

 The brand says Stefano Gabbana's account was hacked. Dolce & Gabbana has quickly canceled its Shanghai show on the day of the event, following claims that designer Stefano Gabbana has posted offensive Instagrams regarding China.  The controversial posts appeared on Stefano Gabbana's account following backlash to a series of videos the brand released. Titled "eating with chopsticks," the videos featured a model being instructed in Mandarin by a male voice how to eat Italian food, including pizza and spaghetti. Critics said the videos trivialized "China's centuries-old culture... depicting Chinese women in a stereotypical and even racist way" (via BBC and Jing Daily). Gabbana appeared to criticize China in a series of posts and messages, in an attempt to defend the "eating with chopsticks," and lament the fact that it had been deleted from Chinese social network Weibo. Diet Prada posted a screenshot of the Instagram exchange between Gabbana and Michaela Phuong Thanh Tranova:  As @dolcegabbana prepares to mount their next runway show in Shanghai this coming evening (7:30PM) and the rest of Instagram fawns over what‚Äôs sure to be an overly lavish ‚Äúlove letter‚Äù to China, we‚Äôll be wondering if we‚Äôll see chopsticks as hair ornaments, take-out boxes as purses, or even kimonos misappropriated as Chinese costume.  Time will tell.  For now, we‚Äôll let y‚Äôall simmer on this DM between Stefano and Dieter @michaelatranova (chronology is reversed in slides). Word has it that they‚Äôre still in the process of model casting (over 200 Asian girls scheduled)...wouldn‚Äôt let them walk the show if we were their agents lol.  Also, curious what the Chinese government will think of their country being called shit basically...especially considering how strict they are on who to allow to enter the country on work visas based on a thorough social media background checks. ‚Ä¢ #DGTheGreatShow #DGlovesChina #runway #fashionshow #cancelled #racism #dolceandgabbana #altamoda #rtw #dgmillennials #stefanogabbana #shanghai #chinese #china #wtf #dumb #lame #asianmodel #asian #dietprada A post shared by  Diet Prada ‚Ñ¢ (@diet_prada) on Nov 20, 2018 at 7:05pm PST According to WWD, actress Zhang Ziyi was one of the first stars to say that she would no longer be attending, while the China Bentley modeling agency revealed that the 24 models they represent who were meant to be walking in the show would now be boycotting. Apologizing for the posts, Gabbana wrote on his personal account, "My Instagram account has been hacked. My legal office is working on this. I love China and the Chinese culture. I‚Äôm so sorry for what happened." The brand's official page also shared two apologies regarding the incident:  Our Instagram account has been hacked. So has the account of Stefano Gabbana. Our legal office is urgently investigating. We are very sorry for any distress caused by these unauthorized posts, comments and direct messages. We have nothing but respect for China and the people of China.

 Demonstrated by BAZAAR‚Äôs Kerry Pieri. When curating your fall wardrobe, shorts and high hemlines probably aren't at the top of your list. But to that, we say: why not? Thanks to the versatile power of tights, you can wear almost any piece year-round‚Äîthe trick is clever layering. To demonstrate, our Fashion and Features Director Kerry Pieri styled four different pairs of Calzedonia tights with outfits for four different occasions: work, date night, the weekend, and a formal night out.  Some may balk at the idea of wearing shorts in brisk weather, but pairing them with Calzedonia's cozy pair of super-warm cashmere tights makes them perfect for cold-weather styling.  Here, Kerry styles tailored schoolboy shorts with a plaid coat and combat boots‚Äîwhich adds an edge to the otherwise preppy look.    A V-neck cardigan dress with a few added layers‚Äîsuch as a turtleneck and a pair of seamless, sheer polka-dot tights‚Äîcan easily take you from work to dinner or drinks. Kerry complements the tights‚Äô fun pattern with macro-embellished buttons.  For a ‚Äò70s-inspired look, Kerry mixes three fall-ready pieces: a cashmere top, a corduroy mini skirt, and leather loafers. Each texture can stand on its own, but it‚Äôs the opaque Calzedonia tights in a warm gray hue that bridge the white-and-black duotones and create one fresh, modern look.  This black wrap dress, complete with dramatic statement sleeves and luxe draping, makes for a sophisticated look perfect for a formal evening. The rich satin sheen of the dress offsets Kerry's super-sheer seamless tights‚Äîwhich allows for open-toe platforms even in brisk weather.
 NYFW designers will lend their support   For the second season in a row the New York fashion industry is coming together to stand up for what‚Äôs right. Today, the Council of Fashion Designers of America has announced that it will be launching an initiative during fashion week to support the ACLU. Titled ‚ÄúFashion for ACLU,‚Äù the CFDA is hoping it will encourage its members to speak out against racism, bigotry, and hatred. ‚ÄúWe want to be on the front line, not the sidelines, to boldly fight to protect our precious rights and freedoms, which has taken on a renewed urgency after the heart-wrenching events of Charlottesville,‚Äù Steven Kolb, President and CEO of the CFDA, said in a statement. ‚ÄúOur goal is to actively support concrete work that will move our country meaningfully forward. The ACLU is doing that critical work.‚Äù Designers are being asked to feature the ‚ÄúFashion for ACLU‚Äù tagline at their events, and to pass out a special edition of the ACLU‚Äôs blue lapel ribbon. Meanwhile, attendees are being asked to use #StandWithACLU and #FashionforACLU when posting on social media. Over 50 designers (including Adam Selman, Diane von Furstenberg, Monse, Opening Ceremony, Prabal Gurung, and Public School, among others) have already pledged to help promote the initiative.  Additionally, the ride-share service Lyft will run a special promotion during fashion week where it will donate $5 from rides to and from NYFW events to the ACLU, when riders use the promo code ‚ÄúFASHIONSTANDS.‚Äù This will mark the second season in a row in which the CFDA has put its weight behind a worthy cause. Last season it partnered with Planned Parenthood, creating pink buttons that were worn by many all week long. It goes to show that not only does New York fashion have a heart, but that it is also fearless in the face of adversity.

 Give your feet the royal treatment.   You guys, it looks like Meghan Markle's treasured Sarah Flint sandals, the Grear style in "Saddle," are finally back in stock today. Great news if you've ever tried to cop these bad boys previously, only to find that they were sadly sold out. What makes them her fave shoes, you ask? Only the fact that she's worn them, like, a thousand times. OK, maybe not a THOUSAND, but you get my drift.  She wore them twice while on her royal tour of Australia last year and she also wore them at the Audi Polo Challenge last June. Plus, she was even seen wearing them *before* she was a Duchess because they were all over her now-deleted Instagram.  While they aren't exactly inexpensive, they're definitely not as much as the Givenchy dresses and Aquazzura pumps she sports on some formal occasions. Need more of an incentive to snag yourself a pair? According to a press release, the last time there was a restock, they sold out in less than one. day. While Meg is a fan of the tan colorway (which is by far the most in-demand version), the shoe is also available in white, gold, and, now, in a brand-new black hue.  Anyway, it's almost summer, and your toes deserve to be freed in these Duchess-approved sandals, right? Treat yourself!

 Rising rent and falling visitor numbers have led to the iconic store's demise Iconic department store Barneys is set to close after it filing for bankruptcy. The New York department store has felt the effects of rising rents and fewer visitors to its luxury fashion boutiques.  The chain listed estimated liabilities of between $100 million and $500 million and sought to avert bankruptcy by finding a partner or buyer, according to the Business of Fashion. George Angelich, from law firm Arent Fox, explained that ‚Äúit becomes very challenging to maintain profitability‚Äù when rents increase and consumers favour buying online rather than in store.  Its closure marks changing times for the high-street, as more consumers favor shopping online than in brick and mortar stores.  Here in the UK, there are similar pressures. One in 12 shops on the British high-street have closed in the last five years according to the Guardian. In June, Topshop, formerly a British high street giant, was saved from administration after a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) agreed to Green‚Äôs proposed rent cuts - up to 50 per cent less - plus 23 store closures and 520 job losses. Barneys quickly became an icon of high fashion for men and women in the 1970s, after originally being founded as a men‚Äôs retailer in 1923. The Manhattan store went bankrupt before in 1996 after falling out with a Japanese partner.  In 2019, the retailer is owned by investor Richard Perry and operates stores in New York City on Madison Avenue and Chelsea. Other store locations include Beverly Hills, Chicago, Seattle, Boston, San Francisco and Las Vegas.  Barneys planned to downsize the Madison Avenue store to reduce the annual rent, which had tripled the year according to Bloomberg.

 His family said he ‚Äúhad been in failing health of late and was heartbroken over the recent death of his beloved daughter.‚Äù Just two weeks after designer Kate Spade died at 55, her father, Earl F. (Frank) Brosnahan, has died at 89, his family announced in a statement Thursday. Funeral services for Spade were just about to start at the time of the announcement, the Kansas City Star reported. ‚ÄúWe are deeply saddened to announce that Katy‚Äôs father, Earl F. Brosnahan, Jr. (Frank), passed away last night at age 89. He had been in failing health of late and was heartbroken over the recent death of his beloved daughter,‚Äù the statement read. ‚ÄúHe was at home and surrounded by family at the time of his passing.‚Äù    Brosnahan, who lived in Kansas City, Missouri, was a veteran of the U.S. Navy who took over his family‚Äôs construction business from his father. He and his wife, June Therese Mullen, were married in 1953 and had six children, including Kate, before divorcing in 1972. He remarried, and his wife, Sandy Palmer, was by his side when he died.    He told the Kansas City Star he hoped some good would come out of conversations surrounding his daughter‚Äôs death. "One thing we feel is that any talk that they do that helps somebody else, Katy would have liked that," he said. "She was always giving and charitable. If that helped anybody avoid anything‚Äîfine, she'd be delighted."   Kate Spade New York announced plans Wednesday to donate $1 million to mental health awareness and suicide prevention charities.   
 The French house is headed to Hamburg, Germany. Karl Lagerfeld has chosen his hometown of Hamburg, Germany, as the next location for Chanel's M√©tiers d‚ÄôArt, the French house confirmed to WWD. The venue of choice is the Elbphilharmonie, an architecturally stunning concert hall perched right on the Elbe River, overlooking the city's port. The presentation will take place on December 6. The structure, known for its wave-like roof, was designed by architects Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron. Although it just opened inJanuary, it was inspired by ancient amphitheaters and stadiums like the theater at Delphi.  The collection hitting the runway will be Chanel's pre-fall, ready-to-wear range, which Lagerfeld debuted 16 years ago. (We imagine models will parade the looks from floor to floor in the concert hall's abstract interior, but who knows what he has in mind.)  The designer has previously shown M√©tiers d‚ÄôArt collections in the Ritz in Paris, Dallas, Salzburg and Tokyo.  Lagerfeld just presented his Spring 2018 range for the French house yesterday at Paris Fashion Week, debuting some chic rainwear alongside artificial (but nonetheless astonishing) waterfalls in the Grand Palais.
 He marks the brand's first African-American artistic director. Virgil Abloh, founder of high-fashion streetwear brand Off-White and creative director for Kanye West, has been named the new menswear artistic director for Louis Vuitton.  He is the first African-American artistic director the brand, and is one of the few designers of color to helm a major fashion house, following Olivier Rousteing for Balmain and Ozwald Boateng for Givenchy (during 2003-2007), the New York Times reports.  Abloh will debut his first collection for Vuitton in June for men's fashion week in Paris. He replaces Kim Jones, who left in January to become the menswear designer for Christian Dior, a position previously held by Kris Van Assche for 11 years. Like Abloh, Jones will also host his first show for Dior in June. The Off-White designer announced his new position late last night with a cryptic picture of a Vuitton trunk on Instagram. "I feel elated," Abloh told the New York Times. "This opportunity to think through what the next chapter of design and luxury will mean at a brand that represents the pinnacle of luxury was always a goal in my wildest dreams. And to show a younger generation that there is no one way anyone in this kind of position has to look is a fantastically modern spirit in which to start." Louis Vuitton CEO Michael Burke praised Abloh's "innate creativity and disruptive approach (that) have made him so relevant, not just in the world of fashion but in popular culture today." Indeed, since meeting Kanye over 10 years ago and founding Off-White in 2013, Abloh has risen to prominence with beyond just fashion folk, and has become a favorite among stylish young people. (He often makes a cameo on Bella Hadid's Instagram.) The designer will continue to helm Off-White and collaborate with West. His first order of business at Vuitton? Creating an "eight-page brand manual" to "define new codes," Abloh explained to NYT. "My muse has always been what people actually wear, and I am really excited to make a luxury version of that."

 The tried and tested heels for walking pain and blister-free.  The term ‚Äúcomfortable heels‚Äù may sound like an urban fashion legend, but trust us: they exist. From platforms to block heels to classic pumps, there are plenty of footwear options that give you some height without sacrificing comfort or style (these aren‚Äôt your grandma‚Äôs orthopedic heels). If you‚Äôre still in search of the perfect pair that you can stand/walk/survive in without battling blisters or crippling pain, look no further than these heels that were tried and tested by the editors of BAZAAR.com. Scroll down to shop them all (your feet can thank us later).  "In the summer, sometimes all you need is a colorful mule to take an outfit to the next level. I love this pair from M. Gemi; just slip them on and go!" ‚ÄîErica Gonzales, News and Entertainment Editor "A wedge is the ultimate way to get height without sacrificing comfort. I lived in these Chlo√© espadrilles throughout my pregnancy and they're still my summer go-to." ‚ÄîJoyann King, Executive Director¬† "These sandals have quickly become my favorite summer heel because they're the perfect mix of comfort and fashUN. Not only are they the perfect walking height, the straps don't uncomfortably dig into your feet, which is difficult when shopping the strappy sandal trend." ‚ÄîLauren Alexis Fisher, Market Editor "A good platform gives you all the height with none of the pain associated with other¬†heels. Prada makes a good one." ‚ÄîKerry Pieri, Fashion/Features Director¬† "Honestly, I've never had a bad experience in a Schutz heel, they're so comfortable and this style has become my go-to because you can literally wear them with anything." ‚ÄîChrissy Rutherford, Special Projects Director, Talent and Social¬† "This is the MOST¬†comfortable¬†heel¬†I own. It dresses up all of my summer outfits, and I‚Äôm able to stand for long periods of time without my feet aching. It‚Äôs the perfect work-to-happy hour shoe." ‚ÄîIngrid Frahm, Photo Designer ‚ÄúI rarely wear¬†heels‚Äîso if I have a rare super-fancy event I don‚Äôt mind if my shoes make my feet ache. But if I have an occasion that requires wearing¬†heels¬†for longer than just a dinner, I‚Äôll reach for the Banana Republic 12-Hour Pump. I have them in three colors and can wear them all day long without even an inkling of discomfort. They‚Äôre inexpensive and basic and I can run around in them.‚Äù ‚ÄîJenna Rosenstein, Beauty Director¬† ‚ÄúThese¬†heeled sandals are great in warmer weather and can take you from work into the weekend. I especially love the pop of yellow with a pair of jeans or a simple sundress.‚Äù¬† ‚ÄîLauren Sheffield, Content Strategy Manager "My giant feet make it hard to find shoes that fit, look good, and are¬†comfortable. I swear by Madewell‚Äôs block-y¬†heels for everything; they put them on dozens of styles and I tend to buy them in every color." ‚ÄîJulie Kosin,¬†Director of Audience Strategy and Entertainment "I wear these boots all fall and winter (and sometimes with short skirts in the summer)¬†and can run in them if needed! I own them in suede, velvet, and satin and they go with absolutely everything.¬†¬†They easily transition from weekend wear, to¬†the office to nights out‚ÄìI pair them just as easily with¬†cocktail dresses as I do with jeans and sweaters during the colder months.‚Äù ‚ÄîCarrie Goldberg, Weddings & Travel¬†Director "These start out miserably uncomfortable, like most new shoes, but after a week, they feel like slippers. The chunky, 2-inch¬†heels¬†helps‚Äîthey never get stuck in New York City grates, and they're just high enough to avoid hurting the ball of your foot." ‚ÄîOlivia Fleming, Features Director
 Bella Hadid's latest Versace runway look says yes. A group of wise prophets once said, "I don't think you're ready for this jelly," and that's the only way to preface the information I'm about to drop here: exposed thongs are trying to stage a comeback. Let's all take a moment of silence before we embark on this journey together... Over the weekend, Versace Men's Spring 2020 runway show unfolded in Milan. A total of 58 looks, comprised of both men and womenswear, ranged from leather to suiting to animal print. But amongst the lineup of very Versace prints and silhouettes, one late '90s/early '00s trend snuck in: an exposed (and bedazzled) thong paired with low-rise pants. Perhaps more importantly, it was worn by none other than Bella Hadid.  If you're confused about the significance and severity of the situation here, let me remind you of a key line that our Founding Fathers once wrote in the Constitution, "anything Bella Hadid wears shall become a trend immediately." I don't make the rules, people, I'm just reporting the facts. Of course, the return of the exposed thong trend shouldn't come as a complete surprise. With fashion's current obsession with nostalgia, we've seen the return of just about every '90s and '00s trend (from ultra-tiny sunglasses to heeled flip flops and so on) in the past few seasons. It was only a matter of time until wearing our underwear above our pants became a Thing again. Most recently, Hailey Bieber brought the exposed thong to the red carpet at this year's Camp-themed Met Gala. Nostalgic camp, it seems, is having a moment outside the Met Costume Exhibition too.  As well as being worn by every It girl of the early 2000s (Britney, Xtina, Paris, etc.), the exposed thong also notoriously made it to many red carpets of the past. Gillian Anderson famously wore the look to an Oscars after party in 2001, while Halle Berry and Christina Aguilera both hit red carpets in thong-baring dresses in the year 2000.   The exposed thong's status was of course cemented with the 1999 anthem, "Thong Song" by Sisqo. Love it or hate it, how many questionable trends have received a full-on bop in their honor? The correct answer is: that thong thong thong thong thong. If anyone has the power to bring back this polarizing trend in the year 2019, it's Bella Hadid. But are we all ready to show off our thongs again? In this economy? Only time (and our Instagram feeds) will tell...
 The best-selling author opens up about the couture Christian Dior dress that gave her some of her most magical memories.  A love story about a dress. That sounds a little odd. But a special dress in this case. An haute couture dress from Christian Dior in Paris. From the Fall/Winter 1994 haute couture collection in Paris, designed by Gianfranco Ferr√©. A dress in which memories are made. Haute couture is a rare art form today. It‚Äôs something I grew up watching and loving, with a lifelong passion for fashion. I was lucky enough to go to haute couture shows as a young girl in Paris, in my teens. My grandmother gave me my first couture suit at 17 by a designer who has long since disappeared. I loved it, it was pale blue and white wool, and I wore it with my Twiggy-styled hair then and felt incredibly chic. And my mother-in-law gave me my first haute couture evening gown when I married, a black satin Balenciaga evening gown. It had previously been hers and fit me like a glove. My passion for fashion was serious and sincere. I eventually went to Parsons School of Design at the same time I attended NYU. Five of my nine children are daughters, three of whom work in fashion, and have the same love of beautiful clothes that I have. I took them to the haute couture shows when they were very little children. And yes, haute couture clothes have always been expensive, but not the way they are today. Today, they are out in the stratosphere. There are almost no haute couture houses left. The only ones remaining of the original houses are Dior and Chanel. It is a very rare protected species now, but it‚Äôs still alive! "There are two to three fittings, and it will be many months before you get your dress. The anticipation is part of the mystery and the magic." What defines ‚Äúhaute couture‚Äù is that every stitch is made by hand (not a single machine stitch anywhere!). Designed by a great master, the garment is then handled by seamstresses who train as apprentices for 12 years before they are allowed to make the actual clothes. For the client, first she goes to the runway show, in January and July for haute couture, by invitation only, in an impressive location. Gorgeous models wear the clothes; movie stars and fashion editors and presidents‚Äô wives attend. And then you go to an appointment at the couture house, and try on the clothes you loved most in the show. It makes one dream a bit, there is magic in the air, you put on an exquisite gown and feel like a fairy princess. And that‚Äôs only the beginning. There are two to three fittings, and it will be many months before you get your dress. The anticipation is part of the mystery and the magic. The first fitting is in muslin, which is part of the ritual. The next fitting or two are in the actual dress in the fabric it was designed for. And at last, in an exquisite box, the gown or dress or suit arrives, and there is your gem, your prize, the dress you dreamed of for many months, which fits you to perfection and you have a dress you will love forever, and hopefully in which you will have experiences you will never forget. The dress I am writing about flew from Paris to San Francisco, and arrived in an enormous wooden crate, about five or six feet tall, and six feet wide, to accommodate the enormous hoop skirt. Opening the crate, which wouldn‚Äôt go through any door, was like unveiling a work of art. There it was, the dress I had waited for. And when I tried it on, it fit perfectly of course, after three fittings at the House of Dior in Paris. The dress is an ivory heavy silk blouse, long sleeves, high neck, loose flowing folds, and a small waist, to go with a cognac-colored shimmering pleated silk immense ball gown skirt over a hoop frame, like 18th- and 19th-century dresses. What I thought immediately when I saw it was that it reminded me of Anna in The King and I. The fabric is light, and the hoop (a thin metal wire like a huge birdcage under the dress) holds it out several feet all around. The skirt moves like a bell, it has a train which trails gently behind. And the hoop is very lightweight so the dress seems to float around you. Being very fond of old things and old homes and relics of the past, my husband, John Traina, and I, as our family began to grow, bought a very old home (very much like Downton Abbey). It hadn‚Äôt been lived in for many years, and we restored it completely. And among the wonders of the house is a ballroom. We loved to give parties, and could give dinner parties for a hundred people in black tie, with a band so we could dance all night. It was a style which was already antiquated then, and an era which will never come again, but how beautiful it was! "I will never forget the feeling of gliding onto the dance floor in that magical dress with the huge ball gown skirt swirling around me as we danced." It was the perfect room for the beautiful Dior dress with the cognac-colored ball skirt. My husband was very elegant and a wonderful dancer. And I will never forget the feeling of gliding onto the dance floor in that magical dress with the huge ball gown skirt swirling around me as we danced. And I felt just like Anna in The King and I when they played ‚ÄúShall We Dance?‚Äù ‚Ä¶ yes, we shall ‚Ä¶ forever and ever in that magical dress. Couture gowns are meant to make you feel magical. And it truly did. I could wear the dress today, it‚Äôs so beautiful and timeless. The dress is a poem in a love story that will last forever. I wore it more than once, and once for a book cover. It is regal. Shall We Dance? ‚Ä¶ yes ‚Ä¶ forever and ever ‚Ä¶ and ever. Best-selling author Danielle Steel‚Äôs latest books are Silent Night, out now, and Blessing in Disguise, available May 7.

 An updated guide on which luxury fashion brands are now fur-free. Joining a growing list of designers, Versace is the latest luxury fashion brand going fur-free.  In an interview with 1843 Magazine, Donatella Versace announced Versace would no longer work with real animal fur in its collections moving forward. "Fur? I am out of that," the designer said, "I don‚Äôt want to kill animals to make fashion. It doesn‚Äôt feel right."    Although the designer expressed her disdain for using real animal fur in the future, the brand has yet to formally announce its decision to stop the production of fur products. In fact, you can still buy a pillow made of rabbit fur for $1,450 on the Versace website‚Äîwhich raises the question as to when this new policy will go into effect.  Versace's announcement follows a string of high fashion brands also deciding to ban the use of real animal fur. Gucci, Michael Kors, Tom Ford, Furla and Givenchy have all recently vowed to stop the use of fur. Meanwhile, brands like Stella McCartney, Tommy Hilfiger, Ralph Lauren, Vivienne Westwood, and Calvin Klein have been fur-free for years now‚Äîpaving the way for more high fashion brands to follow suit.  As the luxury industry continues to cut back in its fur use, see an updated guide on the high fashion brands that have officially gone fur-free below:
 A long list of fashion and beauty brands just signed the New Plastics Economy Global Commitment.  The world's plastic crisis is continuing to worsen‚Äîso much so that the UNEP estimates if current pollution rates continue, oceans will have more plastic than fish by the year 2050. As the issue becomes more and more dangerous to the environment, a growing list of companies are looking to become more sustainable in their operations‚Äîespecially those in the fashion and beauty industries. Just last week, Everlane announced plans to eliminate all virgin plastic from its supply chain by the year 2021. The sustainable fashion brand also launched a collection made from recycled plastic bottles. As of today, over 250 brands across an array of industries are also pledging to address the plastic crisis by signing the New Plastics Economy Global Commitment. Launched by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, the New Plastics Economy Global Commitment aims to minimize plastic pollution through several initiatives across the globe. Burberry, L'Oreal, Stella McCartney, H&M, Inditex (which owns Zara), and Unilever (which owns Dove) are amongst the top fashion and beauty companies who have committed to the initiative.  "Plastic waste and pollution is a big global environmental challenge," Cecilia Br√§nnsten, environmental sustainability manager at H&M, said in a release from the brand. "There is no single brand that can tackle this industry-wide challenge on its own. We must act as one voice and the New Plastics Economy Global Commitment is a big step in the right direction, as it will align business and governments on a common agenda and timeframe. The New Plastics Economy Global Commitment seeks to amend the plastic crisis in three major ways:  Launched in collaboration with the United Nations Environment, the pledge has thus far been signed by organizations which represent 20% of the world's plastic packaging production. All companies that are part of the commitment will be required to publicly disclose progress in cutting back plastic consumption through the above initiatives every year.  ‚ÄúOcean plastic is one of the most visible and disturbing examples of a plastic pollution crisis. The New Plastics Economy Global Commitment is the most ambitious set of targets we have seen yet in the fight to beat plastics pollution. It sets out the steps businesses and governments must take if we are to find a solution to the root causes of plastic pollution and we urge all those working towards dealing with this global issue to sign it," Executive Director Erik Solheim said in a release.

 The actress opens up about the best red carpet gown she's ever worn.     No dress has ever changed my life. Marrying my husband, Keith [Urban], having children‚Äîthose things changed my life. Nevertheless, the fairy-tale aspect of wearing couture is a glorious sidebar to my career. Golly, it is still lovely to me. I always say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to the ball,‚Äù when I‚Äôm walking a red carpet because it really does have that Cinderella quality.  When you‚Äôre nominated for an award, you‚Äôre very emotionally invested. But last year after the Emmys and the Golden Globes [at each of which Kidman took home an award for best actress, for Big Little Lies], going to the Oscars as a presenter was just plain fun. I wore an Armani Priv√© dress, and I have to say they really take care of the details, like how to make a giant bow sit. Because remember, you have to be able to sit in the dress for four hours! Strangely enough, despite the boning on the corset top, this dress was unbelievably comfortable.    We fit it at my home in Nashville before flying to Los Angeles, and it took only two fittings because the team knows my body so well. I‚Äôm five foot 10¬Ω‚ÄîI‚Äôm very proud of the half because I don‚Äôt want to be five foot 11‚Äîso structurally there are certain things that suit my frame, you know? Doing a fitting reminds me a bit of being a little girl in Sydney. My mother would sew all of my dresses, and she would stand me up on the table or on a chair to make sure the hem was just so. The perfect finishing touch to my Oscars look was a platinum- and-diamond Omega watch from 1953. I like to wear their vintage timepieces on the red carpet because they‚Äôre so delicate and exquisitely made. Often the face is masked, so it looks like a beautiful piece of fine jewelry.  "The fairy-tale aspect of wearing couture is a glorious sidebar to my career. "  Keith had to work the night of the Oscars, so I decided to get ready at a hotel close to the Dolby Theatre. Somehow I still managed to be late to the red carpet because we got stuck in traffic. I passed one of those Hollywood tour buses, so I rolled down my window to say hi. I love moments where you can break down that whole barrier and just meet people. There‚Äôs something amazing about awards shows. It‚Äôs an opportunity to acknowledge other actors‚Äô craft and go up and say, ‚ÄúOh, my gosh, I saw your film, and I loved it.‚Äù Many times you would never cross paths otherwise. I still get starstruck when I see people like Jane Fonda or Clint Eastwood‚Äî all of these amazing women and men who have paved the way.  I rarely go out afterward. I‚Äôd rather get home to see my kids. I take everything off, and I fold the dress and am very protective of it because obviously it‚Äôs art. Just like with Cinderella, everything needs to be returned to its maker! Then I run a hot bath. When I go to bed, I wonder, ‚ÄúWas that a dream?‚Äù For the little girl who used to scour flea markets with her mother, the joy of having access to this kind of beauty will never fade for me. ‚ÄîAs Told To Alison S.

 The collection was a tribute to the late designer.  For Spring 2018, Donatella Versace staged a beautiful tribute to her late brother, Gianni Versace, on the runway. Coinciding with the 20th anniversary of the legendary designer's tragic death, Versace's spring collection was an ode to Gianni's greatest prints‚Äîwith his iconic baroque swirls, butterfly prints, and pop art all reimagined into new pieces. Perhaps most moving of the show was the original '90s supermodels‚Äîincluding Naomi Campbell, Cindy Crawford, Claudia Schiffer, Helena Christensen, and Carla Bruni‚Äîall returning to the runway for an epic finale walk. Making for the most exciting moment of Fashion Month thus far, the reunion brought both the magic of Gianni and '90s fashion back on the runway in a truly moving show.

 The star's most cherished clothing, accessories and film memorabilia are going up for auction this September. The personal collection of Audrey Hepburn will be showcased by Christie's at a flagship auction in London later this month. Hepburn's beloved clothes and accessories, as well as film memorabilia and photography, will make up the 500 lots included in the sale, with single items expected to reach up to ¬£80,000 (about $106,000). The price tags might be impressive, but the auction serves as a unique archive charting the 40-year career of the Hollywood legend. It's also the first time these items, which Hepburn left to her sons, Sean Ferrer and Luca Dotti, have gone up for sale, giving Hepburn fans a rare opportunity to buy and view piece's from the star's wardrobe. With this in mind, Meredith Etherington-Smith, creative consultant on the auction, is anticipating attention on a global scale. "We are really expecting global interest because Audrey Hepburn never really goes away," she told Harper's Bazaar UK. "You see her everywhere and her look was always unbeatable, so generations who have might have only just discovered her will be fascinated by this auction." It's Hepburn's "unbeatable" appeal that makes her so relevant today. This will no doubt help to draw in the buyers when the auction opens to bidders online on September 19. "After Marilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor, people were captivated by Hepburn when she came along," Etherington-Smith explained. "They still are because's her look is still modern. The capri pants, ballet slippers and malo sweaters are still relevant, so when you look at her in the films, she doesn't look dated. Audrey looked young, alive and exercised, and people still want to look like that."   As to be expected from one of the world's most admired style icons, some of the most sought-after pieces come from inside Hepburn's wardrobe. There's a Burberry trench coat, with an estimated price tag of ¬£6,000-8,000 ($7,966-$10,622), a 1970s red silk couture coat from Valentino, a collection of her cherished Ferragamo pumps and a blue satin cloqu√© satin dress dress by Hubert de Givenchy, who became a life long collaborator and a close friend of Hepburn's.  But as Etherington-Smith notes, there are a couple of designs not to be missed by her biggest fans.  "The piece which sums up the Audrey look is a dress that Givenchy made for her in 1968. It's a black shift trimmed with cock feathers and it's engaging and young and fun." Other stand out fashion items from Hepburn's films include another black satin Givenchy two-piece which she wore in the 1963 movie Charade. It's expected to reach ¬£50,000-80,000 ($66,000-$106,000) and it's said to be one of Hepburn's favorite items of clothes. "She loved it so much, she wore it a lot after the film," Etherington-Smith confirmed. While Hepburn's annotated scripts from Breakfast at Tiffany's, Sabrina and My Fair Lady are tipped to reach the highest prices, it's the pieces from her wardrobe that highlight just how much Hepburn appreciated fashion both on and off screen.  "If she loved an item, she kept it and all the clothes in the auction are the things she really loved. She invented the little black dress, but she was also fairly obsessive about shoes. 'If you've got wonderful shoes, nothing else really matters,' she believed."   As well as couture, the auction includes a number of Hepburn's treasured gems and jewels. A personalized Tiffany & Co. bangle, presented to Hepburn by Steven Spielberg after filming Always will be featured alongside a colorless tiara which Hepburn wore with a Givenchy gown to the London premiere of The Nun's Story in 1959. Out of all the lots being offered up for auction, there is perhaps one which sums up Hepburn perfectly. A letter from legendary fashion editor and Harper's Bazaar columnist Diana Vreeland informing Hepburn of the success of her UK Vogue cover in April 1971 is estimated to reach ¬£400-600 ($531-$797). In it, Vreeland writes: "The most appealing creature there ever was." Over 40 years later, that sentiment is still true today. The auction of Audrey Hepburn's personal collection will take place at Christie's King Street headquarters on 27 September, alongside an online sale which will be open for bidding from 19 September until 3 October. The collection will be on view to the public in an exhibition at Christie's from 23 September and Christie's Lates - a night celebrating the renowned film actress - will take place from 6pm - 9.30pm on 25 September.

 Career, clothes, mall food‚Äîall of it. Reasons to love Christian Siriano: He‚Äôs inclusive. He‚Äôs industrious. He‚Äôs chiffon-powered. And he truly isn‚Äôt shy. That last part was especially true this week, when Siriano and Fern Mallis discussed his Wham! Pow! career at the 92nd Street Y. Among the revelations: His first commission came from Victoria Beckham, his new store will have a caf√© by Alicia Silverstone, and he‚Äôs definitely a Scorpio, though less Kris Jenner (‚Äúmeh‚Äù) and more Grace Kelly (‚Äúamazing‚Äù). Also, he went to the Step Up School (a.k.a. Baltimore School of the Arts) from sophomore through senior year.    Here are some more of Siriano‚Äôs wise words, including advice to young designers, when it‚Äôs time to ghost on your boss, and how expanded sizing can save a growing business.   "I did a summer program at FIT, and a teacher encouraged me to apply. Well, I didn‚Äôt get it, so instead, I went to London and studied there. The head pattern maker at Vivienne Westwood was my teacher, so she was like, ‚ÄúYou need to go work for Vivienne,‚Äù and I did. It was so far to her studio, like a two-hour commute each way, but I did it because I loved it and I learned so much. Then I interned for [Alexander] McQueen. McQueen was a very inspiring place, and it was a very creative place. I still try to run my studio like that because it was very hands on. But if I‚Äôd been at FIT, I don‚Äôt know that I would have had those experiences‚Ä¶ Now? I have two pieces in their museum, so I think it worked out. And they asked me to speak at their commencement this year. My opening line would have been, ‚ÄúI didn't get in, but congratulations to you all.‚Äù So yeah, it‚Äôs very full circle and I think it all worked out!" "My time [interning] at Marc Jacobs was brief. I don‚Äôt talk about that experience because it was so short. Obviously, Marc Jacobs is an incredibly talented, amazing designer, and I have so much respect for the label, but I didn‚Äôt do a lot there. I copied fabrics every day for eight hours that entire week. My boss was not a fan of me, so that was my job‚Ä¶ so after a week, I did the thing you‚Äôre not supposed to do. I was sent to run an errand, and I was so annoyed, when I got back, I put the stuff on her desk. I was like, ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs all this fringe tassel!‚Äù and then I just left and didn‚Äôt come back." "I auditioned [for Project Runway] when I was 20. I was a kid. Those decisions you make so early shouldn‚Äôt shape your entire career. It‚Äôs like an actress‚Äîone movie isn‚Äôt her entire career, especially her first movie. Other designers did things early in their careers and moved on!... I guess I don‚Äôt like to talk about it too much because being on the show is the worst thing you could do for your career. It‚Äôs reality TV but it‚Äôs not real. Somebody else is paying for your fabrics? You can make whatever you want? It‚Äôs not a real world situation. I wish I could still do that! The show itself, I mean, there‚Äôs something really beautiful about watching people make something out of nothing every week. That‚Äôs amazing. But [to young designers], I don‚Äôt recommend it." "Adding plus sizes to my line tripled my business. Why wouldn‚Äôt you do that?! Do we not want to triple the business? Do we not think these women should wear our clothes? Do we not want these women to have beautiful things because we‚Äôre afraid they‚Äôre not beautiful? What is going on here? Of course it‚Äôs a process to make things in bigger sizes. The patterns are different. There‚Äôs more fabric involved. But we will never charge more for a larger size, because that‚Äôs not the right thing to do. The whole point of being a designer is to make people feel good, we‚Äôre here to make people look cute in a dress. You want to look cute in a dress and you're a size 26? Why not?!"    "You have to put it in people‚Äôs faces. We‚Äôre visual. It has to be on the runway to get through to people. We‚Äôre all stubborn, even me. So when it‚Äôs on the runway, it‚Äôs there‚Ä¶ Now, our business is 50 percent plus size.  The reason it‚Äôs going so much is because the retailers will go with us. We got Moda Operandi to change their whole website‚Äînow they go up to our sizes! Knowing we have a part in change like that, it‚Äôs amazing‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs still crazy to me that it‚Äôs not the norm."

 Just a casual stroll with baby Stormi, nothing to see here.  New mom Kylie Jenner continues to prove she's not a regular mom, she's a cool mom.  While taking her two-month-old daughter Stormi for a walk through the neighborhood, the 20-year-old beauty mogul decided to match her Fendi logo baby stroller (more on that later) by wearing a vintage Fendi logo dress and fanny pack from What Goes Around Comes Around.    Although Stormi isn't visible in the photo, one could only hope the newborn is also rocking a Fendi outfit too. While Jenner's exact stroller doesn't seem to be available online (yet), a similar Fendi one is available for $1,600 at Saks Fifth Avenue. Fendi logo stroller, $1,600, SHOP For the first time since the early 2000s, designer logomania has been making a strong comeback. Logos were spotted on the Fall 2018 runways at Versace, Louis Vuitton, Dior, and perhaps the most popular so far, Fendi. The full-on Fendi logo look has been spotted on a countless number of influencers as well as Kim Kardashian, Rihanna, and Nicki Minaj's latest cover art.  Of course, Kylie Jenner turning the Fendi logo into a baby stroller (and matching look, nonetheless) is really taking the trend to the next level. Though she hasn't shared too many photos of baby Stormi's face on her Instagram feed (minus a few selfies), here's to hoping we can expect the baby to sport a Fendi logo look in the near future. She does, of course, need a look of her own to match her stroller too.  Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott welcomed their daughter into the world on February 1, 2018. Jenner ann0unced the news with an 11-minute documentary-style video that showcased her pregnancy journey. 
 Girl, get your skirt suit on... From royals like Kate Middleton to actresses Keira Knightley and Janelle Monae, and blogger Aimee Song, the skirt suit is slowly taking the fashion reigns. It's also a chameleon: pulled-together and ladylike from Chanel, boardroom-ready by Altuzarra, young, fun and ready to pose for your Insta shot by Tibi. Whether you're in for flirty minis or something more official‚Äîshop 5 that get the job done. The whole ethos of a great suit is getting two pieces that work beautifully together, and look just as fantastic apart. Just like any successful love affair.¬† We'd wear this skirt with a white blouse and black kitten heels¬†when we don't pair it with that killer jacket. A post shared by H ƒí I R (@patriciamanfield) on Dec 15, 2018 at 7:36am PST Patricia Manfield lends some edge to her ladylike suit with unexpected accessories. Belt this oversized blazer or wear it open with a white tee underneath.¬† It doesn't get cooler than this pencil skirt with a matching jacket and great knee high boots. Although this pink coat is utterly lovely on its own, just add a mini and you have a game-changing look.¬† While not under the category of essentials, a pink mini skirt is certainly a wardrobe bonus.¬† Keira's Chanel suit is pulled together, but not too serious. We love the addendum of a matching little hat. This crystal embellished jacket feels right on time for our current '80s revival. A great white skirt is perfect with a coordinating jacket, and looks just as chic with a simple black turtleneck. A cropped silhouette takes this skirt suit from all business to weekend-wear. Menswear suiting has become de rigueur‚Äîmix up your oversized boyfriend blazer by wearing it with a matching mini skirt rather than trousers. A good mini changes up this whole skirt suit game in the best way.

SHOP Original story, 12/4: Skipping a traditional runway show at New York Fashion Week, Kanye West instead opted for a fresh way to debut his Yeezy Season 6 collection: on paparazzi shots of Kim Kardashian West.  The rapper/designer enlisted his wife to showcase his latest designs, which she shared on Twitter and Instagram. According to Kim, the looks were all styled by BAZAAR's global fashion director (and good friend to Kimye), Carine Roitfeld.  Sticking with West's signature neutral color palette, the new pieces range from hues of brown, black and gray to a pretty new shade of dusty blue. While some pieces are similar to those in past Yeezy collections (the standard spandex shorts and minimalist bra tops), Season 6 introduces some fresh West designs like high-waisted wide-leg pants, a trench coat and a shearling-lined jacket.  #Yeezy pic.twitter.com/ls7voophEl Kim unveiled each look one by one, proving there's a Yeezy outfit for every occasion like a "McDonald's run Yeezy," which consists of an oversized chocolate brown jacket and no pants: McDonald‚Äôs run #Yeezy pic.twitter.com/dHrIMiX5xe And "Smoothie run Yeezy," which obviously includes a pale blue bra top, matching high-waisted sweatpants and nude sock boots. If you're wearing anything else while drinking a smoothie, you're doing it all wrong.   Smoothie run #Yeezy pic.twitter.com/lzqHVc1Wcu Similar to "Smoothie run Yeezy" is "Delorian ride Yeezy," a look in which one emerges from the Back to The Future car. (Kim spelled DeLorean wrong, but hey no runway show is perfect).

Storage unit run #Yeezy pic.twitter.com/mvhDiKsC5F And my personal favorite, "Kit Kat run Yeezy," which includes a very good chocolate trench coat that I would love to wear on a Kit Kat run.  Kit Kat run #Yeezy pic.twitter.com/nPuNbQr0Dr Neither Kim nor Kanye has announced when Yeezy Season 6 will be available to shop, but it looks like it may be one of West's strongest collections yet. This is the first collection that West hasn't unveiled at New York Fashion Week. Yeezy Season 5 was the designer's last collection, which he debuted in February 2017 at NYFW. 
 The brand paid homage to its late founder in the perfect way.  This season marks the first New York Fashion Week since the tragic passing of Kate Spade in June. To honor her legacy, the Kate Spade New York brand paid homage to its late founder with a touching tribute on its Spring 2019 runway.  Show notes left on the seats of attendees read, "She left a little sparkle everywhere she went," a play on one of the designer's most famous quotes, "She leaves a little sparkle wherever she goes." Furthering the touching sentiment, the brand's pink runway was lined with a path of silver sparkle and glitter.  It was a subtle, but perfect way to celebrate the woman who loved bringing sparkle, color, and a touch of playfulness to not only fashion, but the everyday lives of the women wearing her designs. The Spring 2019 show marked the brand's first under its new creative director, Nicola Glass, after Deborah Lloyd stepped down in November 2017. Glass embraced the extremely colorful and bright prints the fashion house was originally built on, further paying respect to the legacy of Kate Spade (who hasn't been associated with the Kate Spade New York brand since 2007). An emphasis was also placed on the brand's signature motif, a spade, which played a big role in a range of pieces from the spring collection.   a peek into spring 2019: our 3-d printed floral spade emboss. see the full collection by our new creative director, nicola glass, live. friday, september 7th at 11am est, here on instagram. #nyfw #katespadeny A post shared by  kate spade new york (@katespadeny) on Sep 5, 2018 at 7:04am PDT In the past, Kate Spade New York has shown its collections in a presentation format, but this season marked the beginning of its switch to runway shows. Luckily, it looks like the heart and mission of the brand won‚Äôt be changing any time soon. 
 We're here for these, Janessa Leone and Anine Bing... Anine Bing helped bring Scandi chic to the masses, first as a fashion blogger and then as one of the first fashion bloggers to launch her own ready-to-wear brand. She's since opened up multiple brick and mortar stores and expanded into shoes, bags, home and beyond, never veering from the minimal, cool, rocker aesthetic she's synonymous with. Janessa Leone is the LA-based milliner who helped bring the boater into the fashion lexicon. The hat and accessories designer has a way with sleek lines and imbuing her collections with just the right amount of edge. It stands to reason then, that these two blondes would make something fantastic should they ever join forces. Enter: Anine Bing x Janessa Leone, a collection of three hat styles, a tan fedora, black fedora with studded detail and a classic felt boater that will help bring every fall wardrobe to the next level.  ‚ÄúI  love  the style  and feminine  energy of Janessa‚Äôs  designs and  have always  admired how her  hats can add the  perfect rock  ‚Äôn‚Äô roll  touch to an  outfit," Bing tells BAZAAR.com. "She understands  the beauty in  minimalism  and I love  how closely our  brands are able to co-exist.  Working with  her on this partnership  was amazing and  I am  so proud  to have created three timeless pieces  that will make  the women  wearing them  feel effortless  and confident.‚Äù Anine Bing x Janessa Leone hats retail for $207-$230 and are available on aninebing.com and janessaleone.com now.
 From designer musical chairs to standout runway moments and more, a look back at the year in fashion.  It was a year of highs, lows, and some strides of progress in the fashion industry. From fashion activism to more diverse runways and conversation-starting red carpets, 2018 brought about some positive change in the fashion world. But there were also some notable controversies and the loss of several prominent design icons as well. As the year comes to an end, we're taking a look back at all the biggest moments that meant the most in fashion.  The year kicked off with women of Hollywood bringing the Time's Up movement to the red carpet at the Golden Globes. Wearing all black in solidarity, stars from Meryl Streep to Kerry Washington and #MeToo founder Tarana Burke used their award show fashion to speak up about sexual harassment and gender inequality in Hollywood and beyond.  For Kim Jones' final show as creative director at Louis Vuitton Men's, '90s supermodel icons Naomi Campbell and Kate Moss reunited on the catwalk. Marking their first runway show together in years, the fashion legends also escorted Jones down the runway for his final bow.   Making history, Virgil Abloh became the first African-American artistic director at Louis Vuitton Menswear‚Äîsucceeding Kim Jones' in his role. In June, the creative director debuted his first runway collection for the fashion house to a star-studded front row. The monumental show ended with an emotional moment shared between Abloh and his longtime collaborator Kanye West.  In February, Carolina Herrera announced her Fall 2018 runway show would be her last before stepping down as creative director. Marking the end of an era, the designer's final collection celebrated her most memorable designs over the years and concluded with a standing ovation. Wes Gordon, who worked as a creative consultant to the designer for a year, succeeded Herrera in her role.  Delivering another jaw-dropping Met Gala look, Rihanna showed up to this year's Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination theme looking like a high fashion pope. The singer stunned in a pearl and jewel-encrusted robe, matching papal mitre, and necklace designed by Margiela‚Äîwhich easily became the most memorable look from this year's fashion event.  Another shakeup hit New York Fashion Week when Alexander Wang announced he would no longer be showing during the traditional NYFW calendar. Instead, the designer will now show "seasonless" collections twice a year in June and December to align with the brand's production schedule. To kick off his new schedule, Wang presented "Collection 1" and "Collection 2" this year‚Äîboth of which were odes to America.  From the royal wedding watched around the world to a pregnancy announcement, it was a whirlwind year for Meghan Markle. Now officially a Duchess, it was all eyes on Meghan and every single thing she wore this year. She crashed designer's websites, sold out nearly every item she wore, and established her new style as a member of the British royal family. In 2017, fashion houses including Gucci and Michael Kors announced their decisions to ban real animal fur. This year, a growing list of designers including Versace, Diane von Furstenberg, Coach, and Burberry followed suit in going fur free. Additionally, San Francisco became the largest U.S. city to ban real fur in March.  Melania Trump sparked outrage when she wore a Zara jacket reading "I Really Don't Care, Do U?" on her way to go meet detained refugee children at the Texas border. Causing an outcry across the country (and world), it was one of the most talked-about fashion choices of the year. The First Lady later said her disrespectful jacket choice was a message "for the left-winged media who are criticizing me." K.  Legendary Harlem couturier Dapper Dan debuted his first major collection with a luxury brand in June. Inspired by the streets of Harlem and custom pieces from his '80s archives, the Gucci x Dapper Dan collaboration included apparel to footwear, eyewear, and accessories. It was Dan's long-overdue reckoning in the fashion world, following the 1992 shutdown of his Harlem atelier.  After months of consumer backlash and many stores opting to drop the brand, Ivanka Trump's namesake fashion label announced its closure in July. Following the 2016 election, Trump distanced herself from her brand in order to take an official role in the White House. But given the label's close ties to the Trump family, it wasn't able to survive criticism of its political ties.  Lady Gaga's breakout film role in Bradley Cooper's A Star Is Born may be generating a ton of Oscar buzz, but we'd also like to submit her amazing promo tour looks to the Academy for consideration as well. The singer-turned-actress repeatedly stunned at every one of the film's worldwide premieres. First, there was her epic boat arrival to the Venice Film Festival followed by a show-stopping pink feathered Valentino Couture gown. There was an archival Alexander McQueen look for the London premiere, a dramatic all black veiled look in Toronto, and a sparkling cape gown by Givenchy Haute Couture. A star was born (again), indeed.  After a few seasons of showing at Paris Fashion Week, Rodarte made a grand return to New York Fashion Week in September. The fashion house staged a hauntingly beautiful runway show in a rainy graveyard that perfectly contrasted a lineup of swoon-worthy, tulle-heavy gowns. It made for one of the most stunning moments of the Spring 2019 shows.  To ring in 50 years of Ralph Lauren, the designer staged a dazzling, star-studded show in Central Park. Featuring over 100 runway looks, the collection was an homage to the brand's legacy and greatest moments over the years. On top of the incredible venue and collection, the show was packed with a long list of A-list attendees from Hillary Clinton to Oprah Winfrey, Iman, Blake Lively, Priyanka Chopra, Kanye West, Calvin Klein, and more. Unsurprisingly, the designer received an applauding standing ovation during his bow.  Making for one of fashion's most diverse and inclusive runways of the year, Rihanna made a splash with her first ever Savage x Fenty New York Fashion Week show. The stunning celebration of womanhood featured women of all sizes, races, and ethnicities. Most notably, it also cast two pregnant models in lingerie‚Äîincluding Slick Woods who went into labor right after walking the show. Once again, Bad Gal Riri knows best.  In September, Riccardo Tisci presented his first collection since being appointed creative director at Burberry. Featuring an astounding 134 runway looks, including both men and womenswear, the designer unveiled his reimagined take on the British heritage brand, ushering in its next chapter.  In one of the year's most shocking pieces of fashion news, Michael Kors bought Versace in a $2.1 billion deal. In its acquisition of the iconic Italian fashion house, the Michael Kors Holdings fashion group changed its name to Capri Holdings. Donatella Versace, who will remain the brand's creative director, said in a statement, "We believe that being part of this group is essential to Versace‚Äôs long-term success. My passion has never been stronger. This is the perfect time for our company, which puts creativity and innovation at the core of all of its actions, to grow.‚Äù Hedi Slimane shocked the fashion world when he unveiled his first collection for Celine in September. A drastic departure from Phoebe Philo's polished vision at the brand, Slimane brought the party-ready, '80s-infused looks from his Saint Laurent days to Celine. The outcome resulted in a ton of criticism from fans missing the old Celine.  Though there's still a lot of work to be done, huge progress was made at the September shows during New York Fashion Week. In New York's most diverse runway season ever, the Spring 2019 runways featured 44.8% models of color and an increased representation of plus-size models as well. Small strides were also made in terms of age diversity along with transgender representation.  In one of the fashion industry's most meaningful moves of 2018, Nike cast Colin Kaepernick as the face of its new "Just Do It" campaign. Kaepernick, who began kneeling during the National Anthem to peacefully protest police brutality and racial injustices against the African American community, hasn't been signed to an NFL team since 2016 due to controversy surrounding his activism. Nike went on to broadcast the inspiring commercial during the NFL season opener in September‚Äîfurther making a powerful statement.  Giving us a major dose of fashion nostalgia, Marc Jacobs announced the reissuing of his famous 1993 grunge collection for Perry Ellis‚Äîwhich ultimately led to his firing from the brand 25 years ago. Jacobs brought back the full collection with a capsule dubbed 'Redux Grunge Collection 1993/2018 Marc Jacobs'. To celebrate the reissuing, the brand tapped Gigi Hadid, Slick Woods, Dree Hemingway, and more to model the collection in a campaign shot by Juergen Teller.  A post shared by Dolce & Gabbana (@dolcegabbana) on Nov 21, 2018 at 6:27am PST Dolce & Gabbana found itself in hot water after controversy surrounding its planned (and later cancelled) Shanghai fashion show. Instagram account @DietPrada posted screenshots of an exchange between Stefano Gabbana and Michaela Phuong Thanh Tranova, which included a series of problematic, racial remarks from the designer. Gabbana then claimed that his Instagram was hacked, and that he wasn't responsible for the offensive content. Dolce & Gabbana's official account also posted an apology, explaining that both accounts had been hacked. But after backlash spread online and high profile guests began pulling out of the scheduled Shanghai show, it was quickly cancelled.  Following a heated meeting with President Trump, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi captured everyone's attention not only with her fiery words, but with her red power coat by Max Mara. While exiting the White House like a true boss, Pelosi caused the internet to collectively obsess over her outerwear choice. Memes spread instantly, a Twitter account called "Nancy Pelosi's Red Coat" was born, and The Boston Globe dubbed it "Big Coat Energy."  The infatuation with Pelosi's coat was so immense that Max Mara decided to reissue the design (originally from its 2012 collection) in honor of the House leader. It will be available to shop in 2019‚Äîproving the influence of politics in fashion.  After a year of endless runways, a design collaboration with Karl Lagerfeld, and several ad campaigns, the Fashion Awards declared Kaia Gerber as 2018's Model of The Year. As predicted, the 17-year-old is quickly following in her supermodel mom's footsteps‚Äîand this is only the beginning.  Although there were plenty of feel-good moments in the fashion industry this year, there were also a few big losses. Most shocking of them all was the tragic death of Kate Spade in June. The 55-year-old died of an apparent suicide, leaving the fashion world in mourning at her loss.  In March, the industry lost another icon when Hubert de Givenchy passed away at the age of 91. He was most-known for founding the Givenchy fashion empire and designing some of Audrey Hepburn's most famous looks.  A month later, handbag designer Judith Leiber passed away at the age of 97. She was celebrated for her incredibly ornate, quirky, and luxurious handbag designs.

 Yes, you read that correctly.  Victoria Beckham, the high-heel aficionado who once proclaimed, "I can't concentrate in flats!," surprised us all last fall by announcing a new partnership with Reebok. And now, we've finally got a first look at what the unexpected collaboration will look like.  Making a swift departure from her Posh days of sky-high stilettos only, the designer dropped the first of her collaboration with the athletic brand last night: a line of merch dedicated to Shaquille O'Neal. Yes, really.  Looking to the '90s era of Reebok‚Äîwhich was ruled by the basketball legend himself‚ÄîBeckham created a collection paying homage to the heritage of the brand. For the official unveiling of the pieces, she was joined by none other than Shaq himself. Making for the world's unlikeliest pair, the duo posed together on a basketball court in matching looks from the Beckham-curated collection.  Both wearing sneakers, Victoria and Shaq showed off their hilarious height difference (the designer is 5'4, while the basketball player stands at 7'1) while posing side by side. To even out the difference, Beckham later got some help by standing on a wooden podium‚Äîand then by Shaq himself who helped her make a slam dunk.   Slam dunk! @shaq @reebok #ReebokxVictoriaBeckham A post shared by  Victoria Beckham (@victoriabeckham) on Apr 12, 2018 at 6:17pm PDT Later in the evening, the pair showed off the new Reebok tees with an appearance on The Late Late Show With James Corden followed by a private dinner in Los Angeles with both the Beckham and O'Neal families.   @shaq @j_corden @latelateshow x #ReebokxVictiriaBeckham A post shared by  Victoria Beckham (@victoriabeckham) on Apr 12, 2018 at 11:30pm PDT David Beckham, along with sons Brooklyn, Romeo and Cruz, were amongst the first to wear the Shaq-inspired pieces.   @shaq @davidbeckham üíúüíõ A post shared by  Victoria Beckham (@victoriabeckham) on Apr 12, 2018 at 11:27pm PDT  So glad you like it @romeobeckham! x #ReebokxVictoriaBeckham A post shared by  Victoria Beckham (@victoriabeckham) on Apr 12, 2018 at 9:27pm PDT The unisex line of Shaq merch, which is set to drop soon, is just the first of Beckham's collaboration with Reebok. The designer's full collection for the sportswear brand‚Äîwhich will likely include both apparel and footwear‚Äîis slated to drop sometime later this year. 
 Entrepreneur, designer, influencer, visionary‚ÄîYoyo Cao is the complete package and then some.  All eyes on Yoyo Cao. With her chic clothing label Exhibit and expanding lifestyle site YOYOKULALA, the Singapore-based style star continues to captivate the fashion scene. Your greatest source of inspiration? It‚Äôs cheesy, but inspiration can come from anywhere for me. I‚Äôd say travelling is a big source of inspiration for me. Favorite style icons? My mother was the first person to introduce me to fashion so I‚Äôm going to pick her. She‚Äôs a really chic lady. How do you see yourself fitting in the fashion scene? This industry can get really rough and chaotic. I want to be someone who is able to spread positive vibes. Favorite off-duty pastimes? I love to just chill at the couch with good friends, good food, and good conversations. An occasional karaoke session never hurts too. Most memorable fashion moment? I‚Äôm going to cheat and say my very first fashion season almost four years ago. Everything was so new and overwhelming to me, but every day was one of those ‚Äúpinch me‚Äù days. Style philosophy? Less is more. Who are your heroes and why? My parents. They work hard and they‚Äôre driven, but they‚Äôre also the kind of people who aren‚Äôt afraid to try. What‚Äôs the biggest change you want to see in the industry? It is always so heartening to see female designers making a name for themselves and getting the recognition that they deserve both as designers and businesswomen. We need to continue supporting our women! If you could own one outfit from any time and place, what would it be? I‚Äôve been re-watching some of my favourite fashion documentaries and I think anyone would be lucky to own any one of the couture pieces featured in it, whether it is couture today or from the fifties or sixties. It is like owning a piece of fashion history. Your go-to uniform? I‚Äôm definitely a t-shirt and vintage cropped jeans kind of girl on an off-duty day. I love a white shirt, too. For dressed up events, a pantsuit never fails. What does Singapore mean to you and how has it affected your style? It‚Äôs my second home and where all my closest friends are. I think the weather in Singapore really teaches you to find way to go around trends. We can‚Äôt wear coats or shearling boots, but what can we do in place of it? What‚Äôs the most powerful advice you received? To simply work hard and remember to count your blessings.  Beyond grateful and blessed to be doing @exhibitstore's fourth runway collection ‚Äì thank you @charleskeithofficial @singaporefashionweek who have been behind us from the start and to every single one of you who have helped make my dream a reality. And finally, to my amazing team, I couldn't have pulled it off without you. A special thanks to my bunny @ireneisgood for being my opening and closing warrior princess.

 Here's what to pack if you're headed across the pond. In lieu of the royal wedding, travel across the pond has seen an uptick. But packing for a trip to the land of Cadbury and civilized public transportation can be daunting: there's the inconsistent weather, for one, and an enormity of excursion options, all of which seem to demand their own dedicated wardrobe, shoes and accessories.

 The model reveals the one dress that changed her life‚Äîand how it transcended time.    I was in a car coming home from the airport in 2010 when Diane von Furstenberg called me and said, ‚ÄúDarling, the CFDA has nominated you.‚Äù And I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄúFor what? I‚Äôm not a designer.‚Äù And she said, ‚ÄúThe Fashion Icon Award. It was unanimous.‚Äù And I said, ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm honored.‚Äù Then automatically I was like, ‚ÄúWhat the hell am I going to wear?‚Äù I knew I wanted something that would transcend time, that nobody could ever put a date on. I didn‚Äôt want a color, so if you look at a black-and-white picture it could have been 1950. It had to be couture and have a presence but feel timeless and iconic. Giambattista [Valli] had sent me a couple of dresses for other events, and beautiful as they were, they took up the entire room. I‚Äôve always told him jokingly, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not Sarah Jessica Parker.‚Äù I‚Äôm much taller than she is, but somehow she pulls off these huge gowns effortlessly. I don‚Äôt like big gowns. I have a Somali body; we‚Äôre very small-boned, so things can overwhelm me. And I don‚Äôt want to wear something that I‚Äôm worried about how to walk in all night.  When I was nominated I contacted Giambattista, and he sent some pictures, and I was like, ‚ÄúThis is the dress!‚Äù When you know, you know. So he sent the dress to me in New York, and I had a lot of fittings; we were still tweaking it at the very last minute. I wanted this dress to be like it was cut for me. You see some celebrities on the red carpet, and the dress is way too long, and you think, ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt anyone hem it?‚Äù It‚Äôs one of those things someone in fashion knows. I could walk in this dress; it was easy. I wore it with a classic black satin Manolo Blahnik heel.  I also wanted my hair and makeup to transcend time. That‚Äôs why I chose a chic chignon. I didn‚Äôt want any lip, just a little bit of a smoky eye. And then the jewelry. We went to Fred Leighton, and they were like, ‚ÄúOh, with your neck, you should wear a long earring.‚Äù And I‚Äôm thinking, ‚ÄúNo, I shouldn‚Äôt. That will destroy this picture.‚Äù I ended up wearing simple diamond earrings and some diamond bracelets. I‚Äôve always been anti-trends. I‚Äôm not interested in wearing the latest length or the designer who is hot. When I walk into a room, I want people to remember me rather than what I am wearing.  "It had to be couture and have a presence but feel timeless and iconic." I asked Isabella Rossellini, who is a very close friend‚Äîand an icon in my mind‚Äîto present the award to me. I then wrote my speech and ran it by my husband [the late David Bowie]. He made sure that I rehearsed. He said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want you looking at teleprompters. It‚Äôs your speech; you should know it.‚Äù I was like, ‚ÄúGod, don‚Äôt make it so difficult.‚Äù Only a performer like him would know something like this, because when the dress arrived he told me to try it on with the heels and say my speech. And I forgot half of it. He said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why dress rehearsal is done. You put on the clothes, you stand there, and you will feel it.‚Äù Thank God I had him to walk me through that. I felt amazing in the dress, and it was a wonderful night. I wasn‚Äôt modeling anymore, but I was in a room full of people I knew, both established designers I‚Äôd worked with and young, up-and-coming ones I admired. One of them was Alexander Wang, who made a dress for me, a short dress, for a party held in my honor a week later.  You don‚Äôt win the Fashion Icon Award; you‚Äôre awarded it, so my speech was about being thankful for what got me here, like my long neck, which I inherited from my parents. I also wanted it to be funny and to have a quotable moment. My husband didn‚Äôt know how my speech ended; he heard it for the first time when I got up there. I said, ‚ÄúNow I can finally say to my husband, ‚ÄòMove over, you‚Äôre not the only icon in the house.‚Äô‚Äù He told me that it was the perfect ending, and for me it was the perfect evening being with him and wearing the perfect dress, which I‚Äôve archived.  My husband never kept any of his awards in our apartment‚Äîeverything was in his office. But now I have two statues at home, my award and a tribute award that the CFDA gave to my husband after he passed away. They sit side by side.

 "What they did to me is unacceptable," the Victoria's Secret Angel shared on Instagram. People reports that model Sara Sampaio has added her voice to the growing number of women sharing their personal stories of sexual harassment‚Äîwhether in Hollywood, the modeling industry, or their everyday lives‚Äîin the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal.  The Victoria's Secret Angel alleges that Lui magazine, which is considered "the French Playboy," pressured her to pose nude in a recent photoshoot and used a picture where her nipples were accidentally exposed on the cover of its newest issue, in violation of her "no nudity" contract. Sampaio added that she plans to take legal action against the magazine with the help of her agency and lawyer. People reached out to Lui for a comment, but the magazine has not yet responded. "Even with the 'No Nudity' clause in my agreement with Lui, I was aggressively pressured to do nude shots on set, asking me why I didn't want to show my nipples or go fully nude," 26-year-old Sampaio shared in an Instagram post.  "Throughout the shoot day, I needed to constantly defend myself and reiterate my boundaries with no nude images, making sure I covered myself as best as I could," she added.  When she saw the photos taken, she noticed there were "accidental exposures with parts of my body I didn't want exposed," she continued. Sampaio says she told the magazine she didn't want those photos used.  The photo Lui ultimately used featured Sampaio wearing panties, no top, and a coat that was positioned so it revealed one of her nipples. "Like so many models, I've had negative experiences in the past where I felt pressured to pose nude," she wrote, saying she'd been coerced by photographers or stylists who have seen her pose nude in the past. "I was bullied," she added.  The model added that she's "selective" when it comes to being exposed during photoshoots. "Just because I've consented to posing nude in the past, it does not give anyone the permission to assume I would do it again under any circumstance," she said. "I feel violated, mistreated, and disrespected as a professional and as a woman." "What they did to me is unacceptable. I feel violated, mistreated, and disrespected as a professional and as a woman," Sampaio continued. "I want to do what I can to prevent this from happening to me again, and to others." She concluded saying this kind of "bullying and abuse" is "systemic" in the modeling world, echoing '90s supermodel Christy Turlington Burns, who recently told WWD that "harassment and mistreatment have been widely known and tolerated in the industry." "Sadly, this is not an isolated incident, and I am not alone," Sampaio wrote.   The model tagged her revealing post with #MyJobShouldNotIncludeAbuse, a hashtag created by model Cameron Russell, who's been sharing anonymous stories of sexual harassment in the modeling industry on her Instagram profile. Flip through below to see Sampaio's full statement on Instagram.  I was reluctant even scared about posting this but now more than ever is important to speak out!  As models and as women, we need to stand together and demand the respect we deserve.

 Jeweller Carolina Bucci reveals her glittering journey. As the first woman to oversee her family's jewellery dynasty, Carolina Bucci knows a thing or two about breaking glass ceilings. The Italian designer is the fourth generation of jewellers after her great-grandfather opened a workshop in Florence in 1885, specialising in pocket-watch repairs. After studying jewellery design in New York, Carolina returned to the family business to create her own eponymous brand. Under the newly-created label, Carolina Bucci, she launched the Lucky bracelet, which appeared on the wrist of none other than Carrie Bradshaw, propelling the designer to worldwide fame.  Today, Carolina is known for fine jewellery that is both playful and sophisticated as well as her collaboration with Swiss watch brand Audemars Piguet. Here, she reveals how her journey began. Growing up in Italy and surrounded by jewellers, I received beautiful jewellery as presents, but I always wanted to transform the pieces into something different, more unique. My father, indulging me, would say, "Make a sketch and present what you‚Äôd like to do." The process would go back and forth until my vision was picture perfect. Then I would sit with a jeweller until I created what I wanted. It was the most natural training and I learnt to persevere in turning a vision into a reality.  "I learnt to persevere in turning a vision into a reality." My father has been building the business since he was 18. He's now 82. He maintained our family‚Äôs Florentine workshops and grew the business internationally. Meanwhile, I was studying fine arts and jewellery design at FIT in New York.  When I returned to Florence after my studies, I wanted to prove myself so I worked alongside local goldsmiths and encouraged them to push the boundaries of their traditional practices. We used a centuries-old Florentine textile loom to weave gold and silk threads and I launched my first collection, Woven, in 2001.  I'm now creative director of the business. Despite being the first woman to run it within such a male-dominated industry, I haven't faced gender inequality ‚Äî I believe that a good idea is a good idea, no matter who it comes from. My father continues to be my biggest mentor and critic. Working with your family means complete trust and that's something you cannot buy.  Things really took off for my designs in 2002 when the Lucky bracelet appeared on the wrist of Sarah Jessica Parker in Sex And The City. Demand went through the roof! That was the moment I realised my ideas could have a commercial future. I worked hard on creating the Florentine Finish, which is achieved by beating gold with a diamond-tipped tool leaving small dents in the surface that sparkle. It's now become my trademark.   As a jeweller, my husband has a tough job buying me gifts. On my 35th birthday, he was struggling to find a watch I liked. The watches available for women were predictable with diamonds and pink straps. One day, I spotted a lady in New York wearing a beautiful watch ‚Äî in a slightly stalker way, I followed her up five floors of Bergdorf Goodman. Finally, I got close enough to see it was by Audemars Piguet, the luxury Swiss watch brand.  It was their Royal Oak, a man‚Äôs watch from the late ‚Äô70s that was no longer in production. Luckily, my husband found me a pre-loved version and I instantly stopped wearing any other watch. The Royal Oak compliments my jewellery and my wardrobe perfectly so it naturally became part of my everyday style.  A post shared by Carolina Bucci (@carolina_bucci) on Jul 2, 2018 at 1:39am PDT I started posting images of my beloved Royal Oak on Instagram, which led to Fran√ßois-Henry [Bennahmias, CEO of Audemars Piguet] contacting me for a meeting. It was 2013 and I was invited to Le Brassus where I learnt more about their world, then I invited him to Florence to learn about my business. It was like dating! We clicked.  After several conversations, Fran√ßois bluntly asked why I was wearing a man‚Äôs watch. So, in a similarly frank way, I told him that the women‚Äôs watches don‚Äôt do it for me. He set me a challenge to design something better and I instantly accepted.  My passion was to design a watch for women by a woman. I deliberately wanted to move away from the usual approach to just make a man's watch smaller. First, I used the signature Florentine technique from my jewellery to add a shimmering surface to Audemars Piguet's classic watch design. It took seven attempts to perfect. We launched the first iteration to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the first ladies‚Äô Royal Oak and it was hugely popular.  "I've learnt from working in my family business that there's always a way." For the second adaptation, I wanted to create the watch in yellow gold, my favourite metal. I also wanted to create a highly reflective, perfectly smooth mirror dial in contrast to the rough finish of the bracelet. It's a logistical nightmare, so, initially, I was told it wouldn't be possible. But I‚Äôm stubborn! I've learnt from working in my family business that there's always a way. The result is incredible. Even the watch boxes are works of art. I now wear my Royal Oak iteration for everything from work to weekends. There are only 300 pieces available so each one feels special. I hope that it will reflect the unique lifestyle of the woman who wears it, all reflected in the beautiful mirror dial.  As well as the launch of the Royal Oak Frosted Gold Carolina Bucci Limited Edition watch, I've just opened a new store for the Carolina Bucci brand at 22 Motcomb Street in London. It's at the opposite end of the street from where our previous boutique was for over 10 years. It's three times the size and has different areas, from a VIP client Living Room as well as my Mood Room. I'm excited for people to visit and enter my world for the first time. It's something I hope my great-grandfather would be proud of.  Discover the Royal Oak Frosted Gold Carolina Bucci limited edition here

 Virgil Abloh sent the unexpected pairing down the runway at Off-White's Paris show.  If you're unsure of what one wears to a Super Bowl party, allow Virgil Abloh to give you some guidance ahead of game day. While unveiling Off-White's Fall 2019 collection at Paris Men's Fashion Week today, the creative director sent a series of football helmets, fringe disco boots, and floral bodysuits down the runway. Game day lewk come thru.  In the predominantly menswear collection, two models stood out in matching floral bodysuits accessorized with white football helmets and leather fringe boots. If you're unsure of how football works, this is what they call a touchdown.  And for those nights when you have a game at 7 but have to be at Studio 54 at 8, there was a pair of metallic fringe boots that were the stuff of disco dreams.  Another iteration of the over-the-top fringe boots in a black-and-white leather style featured Abloh's signature "For Walking" text down the shaft.  The cheeky "For Walking" boots are currently available to shop in a cowboy boot style‚Äîsans the dramatic fringe.    Abloh also offered additional options for game day outfits. A model wearing a Colts helmet donned a floor-length shirt dress and black cowboy boots. Sporty, but make it Southern Charm is officially the new aesthetic we didn't know we needed.    So it's been decided by Virgil: We're wearing football helmets in 2019. Leave your berets and baker boy hats in 2018. Helmets are the only headwear accessory suitable for blocking out the BS this year.
 Under the trailblazing, sky‚Äôs-the-limit leadership of editor Anthony T. Mazzola, Bazaar‚Äôs attitude toward the fashion and culture of the 1980s was simple: ‚ÄúMore is more.‚Äù  As the sage maximalist Diana Vreeland once remarked, ‚ÄúToo much good taste can be very boring.‚ÄùThe 1980s‚Äîin Harper‚Äôs Bazaar and in fashion‚Äîwere not boring. By the dawn of the decade, Vreeland, then in her late 70s, was already ensconced at the Costume Institute at New York‚Äôs Metropolitan Museum of Art, where she was revisiting (and, in some cases, remaking) fashion history according to her own ecstatic worldview. But had she still been working as an editor, she no doubt would have greeted the explosion of good taste, bad taste, exuberant taste, and tastelessness that marked the Reagan years as a gift from the fashion gods.The ‚Äô80s have long been regarded as a period of unabashed, and at times irredeemable, egotism and excess. Everything in fashion got bigger and broader‚Äîthe hair, the makeup, the silhouettes, the ideas‚Äîor was otherwise gilded, embellished, glossed, or giddily gaudy. In fact, the only thing about the decade that seemed to fly under the radar was the extraordinary creativity and innovation that fueled so much of the over-the-top fashion, which designers have only in recent years come to acknowledge and re-embrace.  Bazaar editor Anthony T. Mazzola‚Äôs reinvention of the magazine in the 1970s as a pragmatic, earthy, and enlightened women‚Äôs book proved successful. By focusing on fashion in the context of the new kind of lives that so many women were leading, Mazzola harkened back to the original spirit of Bazaar. But as the ‚Äô80s approached, the more aspirational aspects of that vision took on a life of their own. Studio 54 signaled the return of high glamour, feminism gave way to careerism, bohemianism was supplanted by materialism, and the concept of having it all‚Äî‚Äúit‚Äù being loosely defined in some variable order as a job, love, beauty, family, and security‚Äîstarted to become a big driver in American culture. As early as the mid-1970s, designers like Ralph Lauren, Giorgio Armani, Calvin Klein, and Donna Karan (who was still working for Anne Klein) began to build wardrobes, brands, and entire empires around notions of success. The president was a former actor. It was a brave new Technicolor world.  In the 1960s, Bazaar's celebrated foray into space exploration imagined Jean Shrimpton as an otherworldly beauty who fell to earth. But by the 1980s, we‚Äôd been to the moon and back, and the magazine‚Äôs return to the theme was a metaphor for the boundlessness of the modern woman. An April 1983 story titled ‚ÄúDestination: Space!,‚Äù which was shot by Bill Silano at NASA‚Äôs Johnson Space Center in Houston, began: ‚ÄúShe can go anywhere, do anything. The sky‚Äôs the limit. And reaching for the moon is no longer a pipe dream.‚Äù The piece also included a few predictive tidbits about space travel for the masses, even putting forth the notion that NASA was ‚Äúconsidering flying private citizens to a distance of 250 miles from earth‚Äîclose enough for a superb lunar view.‚Äù (‚ÄúWe are not selling tickets,‚Äù a spokesperson for NASA said at the time, ‚Äúand we are not taking any reservations.‚Äù) Chronicling this woman of the era became a project for Bazaar. Nonnie Moore, a onetime Mademoiselle fashion editor, joined Bazaar in 1980, lending a stylish eccentricity to the magazine‚Äôs take on the nascent more-is-more age of shoulder pads and power suits. But the prime avatars for the new Bazaar woman were model-actresses like Brooke Shields, Andie MacDowell, and Isabella Rossellini‚Äîwomen who seemed to make having it all look natural and achievable.  Celebrity was becoming an increasingly important part of Bazaar. Mazzola was intrigued by the cult of personality that was developing in the early part of the decade, and he helped pioneer the now commonplace practice of using movie, TV, and pop stars to sell fashion‚Äîor, in his case, a fashion magazine‚Äîby putting them on the cover. His wife, Michele Morgan Mazzola, was Bazaar‚Äôs special projects editor, and oversaw the brokering of arrangements with fashion houses to dress cover stars for shoots and events. And Mazzola himself was an early mover in the tradition of fashion magazine editors squiring actresses and singers to the collections. Visually, Bazaar became more lush. The fashion stories, even ones built around workaday looks, oozed ambition and opulence, and Mazzola worked with master portraitists and image-makers such as David Bailey, Matthew Rolston, Albert Watson, Patrick Demarchelier, and Francesco Scavullo to infuse the magazine with an air of casual refinement. As he had with the introduction of his popular ‚ÄúOver-40 & Fabulous‚Äù features in the late ‚Äô70s, Mazzola created annual ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs 10 Most Beautiful Women‚Äù portfolios, which featured a mix of notable women of different ages (for instance, Farrah Fawcett, Joan Collins, Lisa Bonet, Cybill Shepherd, and cast members from Dallas, at one time or another, all made the cut). It was Scavullo, however, who perhaps best captured the essence of the 1980s. His rich, luminous portraits of cultural figures like Muhammad Ali, Frank Sinatra, and the sculptor Louise Nevelson brought both glamour and gravitas to Bazaar.  One of Scavullo‚Äôs more auspicious discoveries for the magazine was a post‚Äì‚ÄúLucky Star‚Äù Madonna, whom he famously shot in her full Madonna-ness for an accessories story in the November 1984 issue, which came about after he encountered her on another shoot earlier that year. ‚ÄúShe was playing the clubs then, and this was for a club story with witchcraft accessories,‚Äù Mazzola recalled of Madonna in 2007. Pop stardom back then was beginning to be more all-encompassing, and the rise of MTV helped transform the game into one that was as much optical as aural‚Äîsomething Madonna understood intuitively. The Scavullo shoot came just before the release of Like a Virgin, the album that would launch her into the stratosphere, and for Madonna represented the start of a collaboration with Bazaar that would span more than three decades. (Madonna‚Äôs first Bazaar cover appeared four years later, in 1988; her most recent one was in February of this year.)  Another memorable Scavullo session was with Nancy Reagan, when the first lady granted Bazaar the rare opportunity to photograph her at the White House for the September 1986 issue. Rarer still, Reagan changed outfits four times, arriving in an ivory bugle-beaded top and a black velvet skirt by Oscar de la Renta, before putting on an embroidered navy chiffon dress by James Galanos for a portrait in the Blue Room; a black, rose, and blue lam√© suit by Adolfo for one in the Green Room; and, for the finale, a red silk gown by Bill Blass in the Red Room. Times were heady all around: Commercially, Bazaar continued to flourish in the ‚Äô80s. When Mazzola arrived in 1972, the magazine‚Äôs circulation hovered around 415,000; by 1985, it had increased to more than 750,000. And during his tenure, advertising revenue more than quadrupled.  On some level, though, society‚Äôs reluctance to give the 1980s its due had less to do with the events than with the hangover, which was punishing. On the heels of the stock market crash of October 19, 1987‚Äîor ‚ÄúBlack Monday,‚Äù as it‚Äôs referred to in the history books‚Äîthe bubble unceremoniously burst. Ronald Reagan was said to be already grappling with the early stages of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, and his administration had become enmeshed in the Iran-Contra affair. Soon, Bazaar‚Äôs bright, optimistic outlook, marketable as it was, began to feel like another era. Fashion was changing too, as a group of new models, led by Linda Evangelista, Christy Turlington, Cindy Crawford, and Naomi Campbell, would soon emerge‚Äî√ºber models who would rival the celebrity of movie stars. Mazzola retired from Bazaar in 1992. To some, his reworking of the magazine over his 20-year tenure was a radical success; to others, his Bazaar wasn‚Äôt radical enough. For his part, Mazzola seemed to take any praise or criticism in stride. ‚ÄúI have always thought that success should not be measured entirely in advertising pages or newsstand circulation; real accomplishment, often, is simply putting out the best product in a finite amount of time,‚Äù he wrote in his final editor‚Äôs note, which ran in the June 1992 issue. ‚ÄúThe job has never been anything less than totally engrossing.‚Äù He then signed off with a quote: ‚ÄúIn the words of Sir Winston Churchill, ‚ÄòNothing in life is so exhilarating as to be shot at without result.‚Äô" The year of Mazzola‚Äôs retirement was also Bazaar's 125th anniversary, and to commemorate the occasion he edited a collection of images, illustrations, and writing from the archives titled 125 Great Moments of "Harper's Bazaar," produced as a limited-edition box set of unbound pages. Mazzola remained with Hearst, working on special projects and serving as curator of the corporation‚Äôs fine-art collection. He died in 2014, at the age of 90, having spent 66 years at the company.

 Ahead of the Guggenheim International Gala.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. Selah Marley, daughter of Lauryn Hill and Rohan Marley (and granddaughter of Bob Marley), is a rising model and singer. You've likely seen her in fashion spreads, fronting brand's like Beyonce's Ivy Park and the coolest fashion soiree's from New York to Paris.  The pint-size fashion plate invited us along to her Dior fitting as she was set to attend the 2018 Guggenheim International Gala presented by the iconic French brand.  With the entire 57th street boutique at your fingertips, how does one choose the perfect look? We captured Marley as she tried on and played around in Dior's chicest resort looks‚Äîa floral-embellished skirt, a feminine mini with pleated skirt, the brand's statement jewels and more.    Finally, she settled on an ecru and burgundy stripe and Toile de Jouy print cotton voile dress from the brand's Cruise 2019 collection, which she had tailored to perfection and paired with their black leather combat boots. "Not only does it remind me of an equestrian; but I feel like a spunky tiger and I love the way the color palette of this look blends with my complexion," she told us about her final outfit choice.  Marley, who just turned 20 earlier this month,d explained that there's no real method to the madness of getting ready for a big event such as Dior's at the Guggenheim. She keeps it simple with makeup unless a makeup artist is booked, and if she has the time she'll play around with hairstyle constructions.  "It‚Äôs shameful actually, that I will procrastinate and take my time when I have to get ready for a party. Normally I will set an alarm on when I should start getting ready‚Äîbecause I do enjoy winding down and taking my time before going out, so I stay punctual." The process always involves music though, which isn't so surprising when your family heritage is made up of music legends.  She certainly made it on time to the Guggenheim to mingle with friends and Maria Grazia Chiuri and enjoy the special performance by Jorja Smith last night.  As for music of her own, Marley says we'll just have to wait for what's in the works. 
 The fashion designer is also a business powerhouse. Michael Kors‚Äô parent company announced this week it was acquiring Versace in a multibillion-dollar deal. It‚Äôs just the latest big move for Michael Kors himself, who went from college dropout to fashion world multibillionaire. Here‚Äôs how he did it.  In 1977, Kors enrolled at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York, but dropped out nine months later when given the opportunity to sell his designs at New York shop Lothar‚Äôs. Eventually, after a buyer saw his collections in the shop window, he was able to sell his designs at Bergdorf Goodman, and his career took off from there.  Kors started his namesake collection in 1981, and had his first runway show in 1984. He gained a group of celebrity fans, ranging from Aretha Franklin to Sharon Stone to Courtney Love. Kors looks back at the 1990s as a down point in his career, because of a combination of financial issues and an economic downturn.  "It was a domino effect‚Ä¶.And then the next thing you knew, it was all about nose rings and ugly. I mean, it was a trifecta of a nightmare for me,‚Äù he told ABC News, adding he learned to be true to himself during this slump. "The customer will appreciate that," he said, "and they will stick through thick or thin with you if you do that."   He ended up filing for bankruptcy protection in 1993, when an Italian company declined to continue producing his lower-priced licensed collection, KORS Michael Kors. "Because of the loss of licensing income," he told The New York Times at the time, "we had no choice but to do this. Quite frankly, it was a combination of many things, including the loss in volume as a lot of stores, especially small boutiques, went out of business. In the last two years, we lost a good 15 to 20 stores nationwide." Kors restructured in 1997 when LVMH invested in his company and he launched a lower-priced line. That same year, he was hired as the designer of LVMH-owned C√©line, and became the brand‚Äôs creative director the following year. At C√©line, he was credited with turning the brand around with well-received ready-to-wear collections and accessories. He stayed until 2004, when he decided to leave to focus on his own brand.  A lot happened very quickly around that time. In 2003, Sportswear Holdings Ltd. bought an 85 percent stake in the company. In 2004, he launched MICHAEL Michael Kors, a diffusion line that performed well during the recession, and expanded into perfume, watches, and handbags, while also opening ‚Äúlifestyle‚Äù stores across the country. He also signed up for Project Runway, where he‚Äôd become a mainstream household name beyond the fashion world as a judge. He stayed on the judges‚Äô panel until 2012.  In 2011, Michael Kors Holdings went public. By 2014, Kors became a billionaire after shares of the company went up by 18 percent. Forbes reported he had a $360 million stake of the company, plus more money from the value of the stock he sold over the previous few years. Two people with controlling stakes in his company, Silas Chou and Lawrence Stroll of Sportswear Holdings Ltd., became billionaires before he did thanks to the company‚Äôs success.  In 2015, his company raked in more than $4.5 billion in net sales. Even still, the company announced in 2017 they would close up to 125 stores because of low sales. Nevertheless, in 2017, Michael Kors Holdings bought Jimmy Choo in a deal worth $1.2 billion.  Michael Kors Holdings is changing its name to Capri Holdings Ltd. after purchasing Versace for about $2.2 billion. And Bloomberg reports the company has big plans for Versace, like doubling the brand‚Äôs sales. It plans to do so by boosting e-commerce, opening new stores, and expanding to markets in Asia. It also plans to sell more shoes and accessories.   ‚ÄúIf you look at some of the other Italian luxury brands‚Äîwhich will remain nameless‚Äîthey are doing in the billions of euros today,‚Äù Kors CEO John Idol said on a conference call announcing the acquisition. ‚ÄúSo Versace is terribly underdeveloped and that‚Äôs really going to change now that they‚Äôll have the resources of Capri behind them.‚Äù

 NEED. YOU GUYS. Just when you thought that Primark couldn't get any better after the whole Chip mug, Beauty and the Beast homeware range and Harry Potter christmas accessories lines, they go and NAIL your next must-have for the holiday season. Remember those Minnie the Mouse heels from earlier this year that were REALLY cute but cost about $547.75 from Net-A-Porter? Here they are to jog your memory: Well, now Primark has decided to make all of our Disney-related Christmas dreams come true by releasing their own pair of heels just in time for the party season. And yes, they're just as gold, just as sparkly, and have the same super-cute Minnie ear situation going on at the back. Here they are looking fire:   They do a black pair, too. The best bit about the Primark pair is that they will cost you a measly $18.48. That's like five coffees at Starbucks.  And while this is super exciting, there are still so many questions: When are these beauts out in stores? Is Primark planning on releasing any more colors? Does this mean there is going to be a whole load of Disney-themed party merch you can pick up for Christmas? Need some answers.

 Day 13 of Love's Advent calendar is here and it's üî•üî•üî• Though this year's Love Advent Calendar has featured less lingerie and more workout sessions, Hailey Baldwin's video for Day 13 combines the best of both worlds.  Hitting the model-favorite workout spot, The Dogpound, Baldwin trains wearing a white lingerie set, pigtails (with white scrunchies, nonetheless), tube socks, and sneakers‚Äîas any workout aficionado does.  The workout routine is so relatable, in fact, that you will probably ask yourself, "am I watching Hailey Baldwin workout, or is this lost footage of me at the gym last week?"  Summing up her experience in this year's "Strong is Sexy" themed calendar series, Baldwin said, "I love exercising in lingerie. I mean, who doesn't?" A quote for the history books, indeed.   Watch Baldwin's sexy video in full below: Sign me up for this workout class stat. 
 A look back at the designer's photography for the magazine.  As the fashion world mourns the loss of Karl Lagerfeld, we're taking a look back at his impact on the industry as well as the pages of Harper's BAZAAR. Along with being the most prolific designer of our time, Lagerfeld was a skilled photographer too. The late icon frequently put his photography skills to use, going behind the lens to shoot‚Äîas well as star in‚Äîeditorials for the magazine. From memorable supermodel shoots to the first cover of Kim and Kanye, we're taking a look back at all of Lagerfeld's best photography featured in the magazine over the years.

 Kim Jones looked to the future at Dior Men's Fall 2019 show.  We've seen models walk on water, sandy beaches, and even fire-lined paths, but today, Dior brought us a runway with no walking required at all. Giving us a live-action remake of Back to The Future, the fashion house sent models down a moving conveyor belt runway for its Fall 2019 Menswear show in Paris.  The @Dior catwalk... without the walk. #BoFW #pfwm pic.twitter.com/XpRdUyezXj Of course, this eliminated any need for models to actually move in their looks, instead they stood completely still while being whisked down the catwalk. The idea of a conveyor belt runway may seem like something of the future, but the concept was actually a nod to couture salons of the past. On Instagram, the brand revealed its moving runway was thought of as "a couture salon showing of times past but on an operatic scale."  After Dior, I‚Äôm no longer walking anywhere. pic.twitter.com/AFN1FpBiS9 The show marked Kim Jones' second as artistic director at Dior Men's. He succeeded Kris Van Assche in the role, who stepped down after 11 years at the brand in 2018. Along with its innovative runway, the collection of leather, knitwear, and suiting brought forth quite a star-studded front row.  From runway legends Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell to A-listers like Miguel, Robert Pattinson, Kid Cudi, Lily Allen, and Pusha T, many stars came out to support Jones' latest collection‚Äîand futuristic vision‚Äîfor Dior Men's.

 The stylish way to stick to one color.  While it‚Äôs true that a power suit or the perfect pair of jeans can change your life, occasionally it‚Äôs an accessory that makes the biggest impact. Case in point: a colorful watch. A classic timepiece may conjure up images of black bands and silver faces, but fashion‚Äôs current love affair with bold prints and dynamic hues has paved the way for a fresh approach. We took inspiration from candy-colored timepieces to create five fresh monochrome moments.  Whether it‚Äôs a trench or a traditional swing silhouette, a caramel coat combines function and fashion. Look for styles with oversized sleeves, or belt it to make it a dress. Gold additions, like this braided, yellow gold threaded watch, add a subtle and chic touch. La Mini D de Dior Satine Tress√©e watch, price upon request; Dior trench coat, $4,100; Dior Rose Des Vents earrings; Belt, stylist's own; Martiniano shoes Available at Dior Boutiques Nationwide, 1 800 929 Dior The Parisians may have perfected the blazer and jean combination, but don‚Äôt be afraid to try it in all-white. Stick with a t-shirt to keep it cool, and opt for accents with a similar vibe. A silver steel mesh bracelet with a larger, more masculine mother-of-pearl watch face adds a certain nonchalance that a smaller style might not.  La D de Dior Satine Gold and Steel watch, $10,100; Dior jacket, $3,800; Dior Pants, $1,200; T-shirt and shoes, stylist's own Available at Dior Boutiques Nationwide, 1 800 929 Dior Head-to-toe-black is an all-occasion winner. For an element of surprise, play with pieces you might not normally think to combine. An apron dress becomes brunch-appropriate when paired with a button-up shirt, and looks more casual when worn with a hat. A colorful accessory takes center stage against this backdrop‚Äîlike a malachite and diamond timepiece with an eight-pointed spinning star.  La Mini D de Dior Rose des vents watch, $5,400; Dior shirt, $1,450; Dior hat, $1,250; Dress and boots, stylist's own Available at Dior Boutiques Nationwide, 1 800 929 Dior Five days a week of office  attire can be draining on even the most fashion-obsessed. Mixing two tones of blush is a breath of fresh air. For a punch, try a neon pink patent leather  wraparound watch that transitions easily to after-work drinks.  La Mini D de Dior Wraparound watch, $4,100; Dior dress, $2,500; Coat, stylist's own Available at Dior Boutiques Nationwide, 1 800 929 Dior Dressing for the evening is easy when you start with an elegant dress in a sophisticated color. Search for styles with intricate details, and accessories in the same hue. In this case, a single sheet of impeccable emerald-green jade (with pink gold and diamonds) makes this watch a statement accessory.

 A GoFundMe has been started for the 68-year-old supermodel whose Medicare won't cover treatment in Paris.  Legendary supermodel Pat Cleveland has been diagnosed with colon cancer. After walking the runways at Paris Fashion Week last month, the 68-year-old fell ill and was rushed to a hospital in the French capital. Her family is now asking for help with medical expenses via a GoFundMe page.  Cleveland unexpectedly had to undergo emergency surgery in Paris after modeling in Tommy Hilfiger and Zendaya's '70s-themed runway show. According to reports, she's currently in intensive care at the American Hospital in Paris, where she must remain until doctors clear her for travel back to the U.S.  The supermodel doesn't have health insurance and her Medicare won't cover treatment outside of the United States. Cleveland‚Äôs husband, Paul Van Ravenstein, set up a GoFundMe page to assist the family's medical expenses.  "This was totally unexpected, but Pat is doing OK, she is staying very strong. She is going to have to undergo chemotherapy after a month, and we are hoping she‚Äôll be home in the US to do that. We have to wait to see what the doctor says about travel for Pat. It‚Äôs a shock, how is it possible that this could happen to somebody so healthy?" Van Ravenstein told Page Six. Since the family launched its GoFundMe campaign on March 31, the page has raised $58,000 of its $150,000 goal. Fashion industry insiders including Zac Posen, Kimora Lee Simmons, and Anna Sui are amongst those who have donated to the supermodel's medical expenses.      As one of the first African American models to achieve runway and editorial success in the fashion industry, Cleveland rose to fame in the 1960s and 1970s. During that time, she was photographed by legends from Andy Warhol to Richard Avedon and walked for major fashion houses from Yves Saint Laurent to Valentino and Dior. She was also notably one of the Halstonettes, Halston's go-to model troupe that helped define '70s fashion.  Donate to Pat Cleveland's GoFundMe page here.

 Iris van Herpen lit up the runway at Paris Couture Week.  Paris Couture Week always offers an array of swoon-worthy gowns to lust over. But yesterday, Dutch designer Iris van Herpen lit up the runway with a little more than just artful dresses.  Inspired by celestial maps, astrology, and outer space galaxies, the designer tapped into a futuristic world defined by 3-D printed face jewelry and glow-in-the-dark heels. The latter made for an epic grand finale at the brand's Spring 2019 Haute Couture show.   Standing out as the pi√®ce de r√©sistance of the galactic-infused collection was a sea of  transparent plexiglass heels that lit up in the dark. According to Times reporter Elizabeth Patton, the shoes took a total of four days to create and were infused with two colors of ink, then carved by hand into undulating curves. The end result is a glowing heel reminiscent of the light-up sneakers you begged your parents for as a kid.    Along with the glow-in-the-dark heels, the collection's dresses looked to other cosmic forces as sources of inspiration. A series of voluminous, cloud-esque gowns were inspired by artist Kim Keever, a former NASA engineer whose work merges painting with photography.  Other sculpturally-shaped looks offered a similar effect, featuring 3-D lasercut detailing meant to give the illusion of mythological creatures. During a time when most designers are looking to previous decades for inspiration, van Herpen is looking onward to new galaxies.   
 The shoes that prove it's hip to be square.  Call it the Bottega Effect, but after seasons and seasons of pointed-toe shoes reigning supreme, the square toe is making a triumphant comeback. For his inaugural accessories collection at Bottega Veneta, creative director Daniel Lee debuted a bout of sleek, square-toed mules and mesh pumps that instantly won the fashion crowd over. The collection has since sparked a square toe renaissance‚Äîwith more and more brands joining in on the trend this season.  From Bottega's square-toe sandals (catch them before they sell out if you can) to the brands offering more affordable iterations of the trend, these are the best square-toe shoes to shop now.  Daniel Lee's new era of Bottega Veneta has not only sparked our new favorite Instagram account, but a crop of It girls convincing us it's hip to be square. From Elsa Hosk to Rosie Huntington-Whitely, fashion insiders can't stop, won't stop wearing the brand's new must-have shoes.   SHOP BOTTEGA VENETA SHOES Bottega's buzzy thong heeled sandals, offering up the perfect square sole, are still available to shop in red and white.¬† Transition into fall with these two-tone mules that offer up the perfect hint of snake print. Wear them with trousers for work, or jeans for the weekend.¬† The square look works even better with '90s-inspired minimalism‚Äîthink clean silhouettes and black and white color palettes.  Topshop's take on the square trend‚Äîwhich comes in several colors‚Äîachieves the look for under $100.¬† The trend isn't just for the 'gram, it also makes for a unexpected update on the 9-to-5 pump.

 100% of profits go to Planned Parenthood.  From a CFDA-helmed fashion week initiative to charitable accessories and apparel, the fashion industry has taken a firm stance in advocating for Planned Parenthood this past year. To celebrate the 100th anniversary of the nonprofit organization, Milly (master of feminist tees) teamed up with artist and filmmaker Laurie Simmons (yes, also Lena Dunham's mom) for a powerful new t-shirt.  Merging both fashion and art, the "100 Years Strong" tee features feminist artwork that Simmons originally created to auction at a Planned Parenthood gala last spring. "The prints sold out in like 50 seconds and we made almost $150,000 so I thought, okay this image has to have another life," Simmons told BAZAAR.com at Milly's launch party last night. The print, which covers the front of the t-shirt (the back reads "100 Years Strong"), is an extension of Simmons' ‚ÄòWalking & Lying objects‚Äô series, which uses long and lean doll legs to make a statement on traditional gender roles.  The artist then crossed paths with Michelle Smith, creative director at Milly, who's been a Planned Parenthood supporter for years and the two decided to collaborate on the charitable t-shirt‚Äîwith 100% of its profits going directly to Planned Parenthood.  "My voice is loudest and most effective through my designs, hopefully I can empower women to feel stronger and put something on a t-shirt that maybe they're afraid to say themselves but when they wear it, they can represent what they support," Smith said, summing up the significance of statement-making t-shirts in our current political climate.  The Laurie Simmons x Milly t-shirt is available now for $75, with 100% of profits benefitting Planned Parenthood, SHOP
  The Official Preppy Handbook author Lisa Birnbach reflects on Celine‚Äôs fall collection.  Gawd, I feel awful. I gave away all my knee-length pleated skirts. In the 1980s, I had a collection of them: Armani, Perry Ellis, J.McLaughlin. They were preppy to the max, and they took me to every business meeting, funeral, book party, and luncheon where I was expected. The skirts worked as well with blouses as with turtlenecks. Likewise with blazers or hacking jackets. I wore them with knee-high boots, pumps, and ballet flats. They looked especially good with stacked-heel loafers. If you need help imagining these outfits, please refer to The Official Preppy Handbook, which I co-wrote in 1980. You‚Äôll get the picture. Now these same looks are the backbone of Hedi Slimane‚Äôs sophomore collection for Celine, shown in March in Paris. In a black tent in front of Les Invalides, a glass box with flashing lights descended from the ceiling to the beeping and buzzing of electronic music. Out stepped a model wearing a blazer and plaid culottes, a look that could have come from the ‚Äô80s but felt utterly modern. It was a far cry from the former Saint Laurent and Dior Homme hitmaker‚Äôs signature rock-chick look that he reprised for his Celine debut. It‚Äôs hard to believe that one designer can zig and zag this spectacularly‚Äîit‚Äôs almost as if the woman he‚Äôd been designing for finally agreed to marry the nice young man from the great family with the huge house on the water, and now she‚Äôs expected to dress. Layering and accessorizing are key to the prep aesthetic and to Slimane‚Äôs fall range. Slim-cut jeans are tucked into over-the-knee boots, worn with camel hair capes and Fair Isle sweaters. Voluminous silk scarves are tied girlishly at the side of the neck. Horsey details tell us where our heroine spends her weekend. Aviator sunglasses are ubiquitous. What is happening here? I see cardigans! I see houndstooth! Hedi, you‚Äôre killing me. Do you see the suede baseball jacket? I had that. Your perfect navy pleated skirt practically has my name embroidered in the waistband. You sent the models out with simple air-dried hair, just like ours. Mostly straight, a little wavy; nothing studied or forced. Minimal makeup. Nothing too dramatic or sexy. We know. It‚Äôs the subtlety of this collection that is so appealing. It lures the people it‚Äôs meant to attract. And many of them like to show they have waistlines. Which is to say that it feels like a return to the roots of C√©line, the bon chic, bon genre label founded in the 1940s that I lusted after long before Slimane removed the accent. I remember my parents letting me choose a pair of loafers in the Paris shop on vacation: burgundy patent leather with a fabric logo inset on the vamp. Heaven. But not high fashion. When LVMH bought the company in 1996, the intent was to reinvent C√©line as one of the luxury conglomerate‚Äôs marquee brands. It had a series of star designers, including Michael Kors and Phoebe Philo, who immediately preceded Slimane. For a decade, Philo consistently delivered deconstructed minimalist clothes that women loved. Her handbags had waiting lists that moved slower than that of a top Manhattan kindergarten. And I bet Slimane‚Äôs will be even longer. 
 Tell me, Hedi, how did you do it? When we all thought you were studying art history at the √âcole du Louvre, were you instead going rogue and embedding yourself at Deerfield or Andover? Did you call yourself ‚ÄúEddie‚Äù or ‚Äúthe Hedster‚Äù and pretend to be a foreign exchange student? Did you smoke Gauloises behind the hockey rink so you wouldn‚Äôt get caught?   No more mourning for the Philophiles. Grief has given way to gluttony. That means everything automatically becomes the most wanted item in everyone‚Äôs shopping cart. So we‚Äôll all skip lunch for a couple of months‚Äîwho needs lunch? And, you know, instead of repapering the hall bath, we‚Äôll just‚Ä¶not do it, because I cannot make the same mistake twice.

 Sylvia and Julia Haghjoo take us behind the scenes of the storied French house's show. Art directors and sisters Sylvia and Julia Haghjoo photographed the Chanel Haute Couture Fall 2019 collection for BAZAAR.com today. The show took place in Paris at the Grand Palais, where Karl Lagerfeld staged his collections for many seasons. His successor at Chanel, creative director Virginie Viard, transformed the venue into a cozy yet massive library setting with over 350,000 books inspired by Coco Chanel‚Äôs personal library.  Viard's second collection (and debut couture show) for the French fashion house was a more pared down, intimate affair compared to Karl‚Äôs exuberant Chanel productions in the past. Her softer touch was evident in the rounded shoulders, chiffon dresses, and fluid pants that paraded down the runway. The collection also made heavy use of sequined embroideries and feather appliqu√©s from the brand's couture ateliers. An array of bright, punchy colors were interspersed throughout, as seen in a fuchsia jacket and minidress as well as an orange skirt suit. Models walked out in ruched halter dresses, elongated floor-length coats, and classic tweed jackets. Sylvia and Julia‚Äôs favorite picks were the iconic tweed looks, the acid-colored dresses, and the flat shoes. Sound director Michel Gaubert took charge of the music selection, which was the perfect soundtrack for the serene set. See the below gallery for a behind-the-scenes look from Chanel's latest couture presentation.  
 Meet Farm Rio, your new go-to summer brand.  After months of bundling up underneath turtlenecks and puffer coats, the countdown to our spring and summer wardrobe is finally on. And just in time, Brazilian fashion brand Farm Rio is launching in the U.S.‚Äîbringing over a much-welcomed mix of vibrant colors, tropical prints, and breezy styles sure to take over every fashion girl's Instagram feed this season. From rainbow striped co-ords to palm print pants and colorful crochet, the brand's summery designs embody the spirit and essence of Rio de Janeiro‚Äîexactly the kind of energy we're all trying to bring into our closets after a long winter.  Despite just making its U.S. debut now, Farm Rio is hardly a newcomer on the fashion scene. The label has been a mainstay in Brazil since its inception in 1997 when K√°tia Barros and Marcello Bastos started it out of a marketplace in Rio de Janeiro. Since then, it's become known and loved for its vibrant and colorful designs. The pieces come at an accessible price point too‚Äîwith most ranging from $50 to $250. For its foray into the states, the Brazilian brand will be available to shop online at Shopbop, Anthropologie, and Farm Rio's site. Next month, its first U.S. flagship store is slated to open on April 25 at 113 Prince Street in SoHo. The New York store will reportedly be followed by locations in Miami and Los Angeles later this year.  But for those itching to get a head-start on their spring/summer (and vacation) wardrobe before everybody else, Farm Rio's latest collection is already available to shop online now. Here's to a colorful summer.   

 Summer isn't over yet  We‚Äôre already halfway through summer and if you haven‚Äôt already suffered from a few severe bikini-induced meltdowns then you‚Äôre either lying or you came into summer very well prepared.  For most of us, choosing the perfect swimsuit comes down to a few simple factors: tan-ability ‚Äì yes, that super sexy cut-away bikini makes your waist look miniscule, but you might go home looking like a tiger if you lay out in the sun for too long. Then there‚Äôs the very sensible notion of support ‚Äì underwired bikini tops are so early 00s (and not in a good way) so going au naturel is usually the best option, but depending on how active you plan to be on your holiday ‚Äì a good solid swimsuit can usually go a long way for those sluggish early morning guilt-swims.   And most importantly, it‚Äôs about having options. Lots and lots of options. Not only in case you bump into someone wearing the same swimsuit by the pool, but also so that you can change up the vibe on a daily basis - no-one wants to be caught on their Instagram stories wearing the same yellow bikini for the entirety of their 10-day trip. Here we present five of the best new (soon-to-be-cult) swimwear brands for the season. Fantabody A firm favourite of MIA and Dua Lipa, Fantabody is the brainchild of Milan-based fashion photographer Carolina Amoretti. Previous seasons have seen ready-to-wear bodysuits made of super-shiny Italian Lycra and delicately brushed velvet, but for SS17, Amoretti presents her debut collection of swimwear and it‚Äôs better than we ever could have imagined. Super-flattering high-leg swimsuits in juicy shades of deep grape and citrus lemon are athletic enough to do lengths in but slinky enough to be worn out of the water with a skirt or jeans.  fantabody.com Hunza G Cult London-based swimwear brand Hunza G has been around since the 80s when Julia Roberts rocked their slinky Lycra dress in Pretty Woman. Today‚Äîthe brand‚Äîwhich has been revamped by Creative Director Georgiana Huddart‚Äîhas become the go-to swimwear brand for everyone from Emily Ratajkowski and Rihanna to Adwoa Aboah. With their signature seersucker frabic, insanely flattering cuts and 80s work-out vibes, Hunza G is a no-brainer summer choice (and an instant hit on Instagram). hunzag.com Marieyat  What started as an ultra-modern, all-cotton underwear line designed by Central Saint Martins and Hussein Chalayan alum Marie Yat, is bound to be a game changer in the swimwear industry. Presenting her debut swimwear collection, (which continues to explore simplistic, sensual designs elements like delicate cut-outs and floating suspender straps) Marieyat marries relaxed Italian fabrics with subtle tones of black and stone ‚Äì they‚Äôre not poppy and obviously ‚Äògram worthy, but they‚Äôre timeless and super flattering.   marieyat.com Matteau Swim Designed between Sydney and New York‚Äîby stylist Ilona Hamer and sister Peta Heineken‚ÄîMatteau is a brand that merges timeless designs with simple silhouettes and has already become a staple for everyone including Hailey Baldwin and NY model Coco Baudelle. The sisters‚Äô aim was to simply reduce the swimsuit down to its bare essentials by creating a ‚Äúcalm and assured aesthetic‚Äù. Think ultra-low back swimsuits with spaghetti straps in burnt orange and olive green and sports bra tops complimented with the perfect tanga bottoms.  matteau-swim.com Wave & Watermelon Conceived as a rebellion against the idea of perfection that‚Äôs so often projected in the swimwear industry, Wave & Watermelon is the Copenhagen-based brand that‚Äôs quite literally about to make waves. Founded by Katarina Hentze Grahn (the sister of insta-crush Veneda Budny), Wave & Watermelon blends together badass 90s hip-hop vibes‚Äîthink slouchy Dickies worn with a Brazilian bikini and nothing else‚Äîwith minimalist Danish design-inspired sports tops and classic triangle bikinis (in colourways of rich ochre, crisp white and early noughties J-Lo inspired silver).   waveandwatermelon.com

 It's the second royal award received by Burberry's former chief creative officer. 
 This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window.  Christopher Bailey's work at Burberry is being recognized by Queen Elizabeth, as the designer is set to receive a CBE for his services to fashion. CBE stands for Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire, and recognizes the achievements of people across the United Kingdom. The Queen's New Year's Honors list names 1,148 people, who will all receive awards in 2019. This will mark Bailey's second time receiving recognition from the palace, as he was previously awarded an MBE, or Master of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire, back in 2009. 
  Bailey stepped down as Burberry's chief creative officer in March 2018, and his inclusion on the New Year's Honors list commemorates his impactful time at the fashion house.  Having been brought in as Burberry's design director in May 2001, the designer went on to be named as creative director in 2004 and, subsequently, as chief creative officer in November 2009.

 The First Lady wore all-white Michael Kors Collection today. Just last week we said goodbye to Olivia Pope in the series finale of Scandal, and now, all we're left with is First Lady Melania Trump wearing the white hat. Let's all take a moment to reflect on the irony of this situation... And one more just for good measure... Okay, that's enough. Let's unpack this. To welcome French President Emmanuel Macron and First Lady Brigitte Macron to the White House this morning, Melania Trump donned an all-white Michael Kors Collection look: a crisp belted white blazer, a pencil skirt, and a wide-brim white hat.  The whole ensemble practically screamed Olivia Pope, so much so that Scandal's costume designer, Lyn Paolo, even noticed on Twitter.  Is Melania wearing the white hat?? She is certainly wearing Olivia's jacket....I see #Scandal everywhere....#Gladiators Though the First Lady's look was undeniably chic, its symbolism raises a lot of questions. "Wear the white hat," of course, refers to the act of a hero saving the day. It also symbolizes morality. Was Trump trying to say she's here to save democracy? Is she trying to send a signal √† la Olivia Pope? Or is she simply just as bummed as the rest of us that Scandal is officially over (the TV version, that is)?  Regardless of what she was trying to convey with her outfit, the First Lady certainly stole the show at The White House this morning‚Äîand maybe that in itself was the point of the look. If only white hats could talk... Either way, this is not the Scandal reboot we asked for. Please help, Shonda Rhimes. In the meantime, I'll leave you with this ominous sneak peek at the White House's next horror film:
 A twisty love story, endless flowers, and your dream mansion all in one.  With just one week until the highly-anticipated Erdem x H&M collection drops, a new short film is here to make you fall even more in love with the collaboration.  Directed by Baz Luhrmann, the four-minute video takes place in the dreamiest country mansion where it's "always spring." Much like the collection, the mansion is filled with colorful blossoming flowers. But the floral pieces aren't the only thing evoking romance in the short film; a dramatic love triangle unfolds following a luxe dinner party on the terrace (as one usually does).  ‚ÄúI wanted the film to be like a whole movie. It‚Äôs a very modern love story, set in a country house that is full of its own secrets and it‚Äôs like a metaphor for our times‚Äîit‚Äôs harsh out there in the world, but in here, the things that really matter keep growing in an eternal spring,‚Äù Luhrmann said in a statement from the brand.  And while the incredibly gorgeous setting along with the mysterious/slightly confusing love story is enchanting to watch, the fact that all of these sparkling, floral-filled, and luxe-looking pieces are going to be shoppable at H&M is the real treat to watch unfold. 
 See the look book for the full Erdem x H&M collection, which hits stores on November 2nd, below:
 Olivier Rousteing announced the news at WWD‚Äôs Retail & Apparel CEO Summit.  The Balmain Army is marching into couture. Olivier Rousteing announced plans for the French fashion house to return to the Couture Week calendar this morning at the WWD Retail & Apparel CEO Summit. As WWD reports, Rousteing is "looking to bring back the Parisian DNA" to the Balmain brand with a foray back into the haute couture world. Marking the creative director's first stint as a couturier, Balmain plans to show at Paris Couture Week in January 2019. This will be the fashion house's first couture collection in 16 years. The last was shown in 2002 when Oscar de la Renta was creative director.   Along with couture, Rousteing added that he wanted Balmain to delve into accessories, fragrance, and cosmetics in the future as well. Since his appointment as creative director in 2011, Rousteing has ushered in a new era of Balmain‚Äîone complete with A-list celebrities, model squads, and brand collaborations.  Recently, the creative director has experimented with some more affordable partnerships for the fashion house. In 2015, Rousteing spearheaded a Balmain collaboration with H&M which sold out instantly, becoming one of the retailer's most-wanted designer collections. Last year, the brand also collaborated with Victoria's Secret on a capsule collection for the lingerie brand's annual runway show. The collection, which was available to shop online immediately after the show aired on TV, marked the first time Victoria's Secret teamed up with a luxury fashion brand. While much of Rousteing's work has helped Balmain reach a younger audience and become more accessible, it will be interesting to see how he navigates the opposite end of the design spectrum.

 Some heroes DO wear capes... Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez joined female lawmakers in wearing all white to last night's State of the Union address in honor of the work of suffragists. The style direction was at the request of the Democratic Women's Working Group.  Ever the stylish millennial and House member, Ocasio-Cortez  took her look a step further from your everyday white suit or dress to Gwyneth-Paltrow-in-Tom-Ford-at-the-Oscars places, wearing a white cape-jacket hybrid paired with coordinating pants. Adding her signature gold hoops and red lip, she channeled a '90s Sade on a mission to help save us all. Wearing an actual cape doesn't hurt the superhero connotations.  "2019 is the 100th anniversary of the women‚Äôs right to vote... There‚Äôs so much more that we have to fight for, from wage equality to paycheck fairness to protecting ourselves and believing survivors,"AOC told CNN before President Donald Trump‚Äôs address.

 Her second collection with Quay Australia arrives next week. Since last weekend, baby news has been on everyone's minds when it comes to Kylie Jenner. But as the 20-year-old continues to disregard rumors, she now has something else to distract her followers with‚Äîher second sunglasses collab with Quay Australia. Jenner's follow-up collection comes three months after her releasing her debut collection with the Australian eyewear brand in June. This next drop features three new designs: a rectangular silhouette, a futuristic aviator and a translucent cat eye. "I‚Äôve been wearing Quay Australia sunglasses for a long time," Jenner said of her first drop. "I‚Äôm so excited to create my very own collection and share my love for the brand with my fans." The second Quay x Kylie limited-edition collection drops on October 4th on quayaustralia.com. SHOP Watch Jenner sport the sunnies above, and scroll through the new styles below.
 You'll want to chase Chanel's waterfalls.  1. The Set: Chanel has become synonymous with runway sets of grandeur, and we've come to expect the unexpected. This season was less theatrical than last season's but no less stunning. Karl Lagerfeld clearly got in touch with his outdoorsy side, as this season's backdrop was a towering cliff with several waterfalls and lots of greenery. The models entered and exited the boardwalk runway from caves cut into the cliff.  2. The Clothes: Don't go chasing waterfalls without some Chanel gear. Although this collection was not necessarily made for nature walks, or cliff-climbing‚Äîevery look was punctuated with gear for the occasion‚Äîplastic boots and plastic hats, and some dresses and tweed suits were covered in protective rain ponchos.  3. The Models: Kaia Gerber continued her reign as the 16-year-old queen of Spring 2018, opening the show in a cute mini skirt and coordinating crop top. Victoria Secret Pink ambassador and model-on-the-rise Grace Elizabeth closed the show in a silver evening look. 4. The Beauty: Sam McKnight created ponytails wrapped in perspex, and Tom Pecheux painted an '80s-inspired beauty look with dramatic blue eyeshadow and red lips.    5. The Front Row: Naturally, Gerber's supermodel mom Cindy Crawford was front and center of the Chanel show‚Äîalong with famed photographer Patrick Demarchelier and many of Chanel's favorite ambassadors like Vanessa Paradis, Caroline de Maigret, and Marie-Ange Casta.

From '80s-inspired designs to unique takes on knitwear and unexpected details, these are the emerging brands to watch (and shop!) this year.  With '80s-ready dresses and bold silhouettes, it's no surprise this Copenhagen-based brand is quickly becoming a favorite amongst the fashion set. Launched by Danish influencers Jeanette Madsen and Thora Valdimars, Rotate only debuted its first collection in Fall 2018, but its playful party dresses have already taken over Instagram. We'll be watching for what this brand has up it's dramatic puff sleeves next.  SHOP ROTATE After a breakout year on the runway, you've likely already heard of Kerby Jean-Raymond's Pyer Moss. The brand captured the attention of those in and out of the fashion industry last September with its stunning New York Fashion Week show that celebrated black culture. Merging activism and important social conversation with a new take on streetwear, Pyer Moss is ushering much-needed perspective into the fashion world‚Äîone that celebrates and advocates for black culture in an unapologetic way.  Despite the fact that the brand was founded in 2013, this year will likely be one of tremendous growth and importance for Jean-Raymond, who was just named the winner of 2018's CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund Award.  SHOP PYER MOSS A mashup of menswear meets womenswear, this budding Ukrainian brand is one to watch. From pretty pearl bralettes to must-have trench coats and reimagined suiting, Chakshyn's pieces are a breath of fresh air in a world ruled by Instagram trends. Helmed by Dima Chayun and Anton Yakshyn, the brand offers up a modern, art-inspired take on femininity and masculinity‚Äîplus a stunning collection of pearl jewelry and statement tees.  SHOP CHAKSHYN With just one collection under its belt, Bande Noir has already reeled us in. Under the creative direction of former editor and stylist Mayte Allende, the brand brings forth a mix of '80s and '90s silhouettes defined by their delicate detailing. From open-back turtlenecks to sheer puff-sleeved blouses, the play on femininity and unexpected details has us waiting for more from this newbie.  SHOP BANDE NOIR Sequin suiting, feathered trim, crystal-embellished denim: maximalism meets minimalism in this recently-launched UK brand.

From vintage-inspired blouses to the coolest of jackets, there are several unique gems to add to your wardrobe from this rising brand. Designed and hand-made in Uruguay, Tach is currently an undiscovered secret amongst the fashion set‚Äîbut not for long.  SHOP TACH CLOTHING  In just one year, this Parisian-based designer's e-shop already sells out every week‚Äîand for good reason.

Though her designs have already been worn on-stage by Lorde, we're betting the Brooklyn designer's bespoke creations will gain more momentum in the next year.  SHOP KELSEY RANDALL  You've most likely already seen, screenshotted, and saved this brand's highly-coveted silk, open back blouse on Instagram. Offering a range of seasonless pieces, Orseund Iris' designs have quickly become a favorite for just about every cool girl looking for some new wardrobe essentials. Expect to see more of the New York brand's must-have blouses and suiting take over in the New Year.

 The duo shares their earliest UGG boot memories while facing the brand's 40th anniversary campaign.  From logomania down to the reboot of Laguna Beach, the early 2000s are staging a comeback‚Äîbut the era's staple UGG boots have been here all along. In fact, this year marks the 40th anniversary of UGG and to celebrate, the brand tapped some of fashion's coolest faces for a campaign that's making us want to order a new pair again.  Model Adwoa Aboah and designer Heron Preston star in UGG's anniversary campaign together‚Äîeach bringing their own unique style to the iconic boot. The duo is the first amongst a lineup of new brand ambassadors that will be revealed throughout the month of October. And if you still picture Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie on a Kitson shopping spree when you hear the word 'UGG,' Aboah and Preston are about to change that, ushering in a new wave of the brand.    Along with the campaign, UGG also launched a 40th Anniversary collection, which includes a range of boots and slippers for men and women. The collection, priced from $120 - $295, is now available to shop on both UGG.com and Nordstrom.com. BAZAAR.com spoke with Aboah and Preston ahead of their campaign launch their earliest UGG memories, what's inspiring them in fashion right now, and more. Do you have a memory of the first time you wore UGG?  Adwoa Aboah: Yes, but my sister will kill me! She had the Classic Chestnut pair of UGG boots and I used to steal them from her room before she woke up and wear them out! Heron Preston: I remember I went to the UGG store in Soho with my girlfriend and I bought us matching UGG mini boots, I got the chestnut and I got her the black. I originally only intended to wear them in the house, but they were just so comfortable I couldn‚Äôt take them off! So from the house, I started wearing them in the street just to go grab something from the corner store. But then all of a sudden I started wearing them everywhere! I guess you could say it took some baby steps, but now I‚Äôm full blown rocking them everywhere I go.   What kind of vision did you want to bring to the UGG brand?  AA: I wanted to reflect my peers and I took inspiration from all of my friends and the girls from my Gurls Talk community, looking at how they express themselves with fashion. I love how everyone mixes different styles now and thought it would be great to mix in looks from the street with the UGG Classic boot.  HP: A new and refreshing look at how and who wear the boots. Offering a bit of edge and culture, new faces in the conversation. There are a bunch of cool kids that wear their boots but no one really gets to hear those stories because they are drowned out by past perceptions of the brand. The vision is to introduce new stories to the brand that feel in line with what I've been up to and who I connect with.  Do you have any styling tricks for wearing UGGs?  AA: With a cocktail dress, of course! [Laughs] Anything goes, they are worn best with a badass attitude and confidence. HP: Honestly, let‚Äôs just start with wearing our pants over the boots instead of tucked in. That‚Äôs how I‚Äôve always worn them and it took me seeing another guy wearing them like that to make me want a pair. His style was on point. There are some exceptions to this rule, like sweatpants, since they have elastic at the ankles its hard to pull off this code so it‚Äôs cool that they kind of sit at the top of the boots but NEVER tuck in!  What‚Äôs inspiring you in the fashion world at the moment?  AA: I‚Äôm so inspired by the huge diversity in fashion right now, it makes me so happy and hopeful for how our industry will continue to develop in the right direction. I love how brands can have a direct link to the consumer and I think this is one of the major causes for this amazing change.  HP: I‚Äôm excited that it feels like we‚Äôve hit a point in the fashion industry where people aren‚Äôt so afraid to try new things and take chances and risks. I think the industry is a bit more open-minded for embracing change. Look at the work Rihanna is doing with her lingerie line. Or Virgil‚Äîwho is a trained architect‚Äîbut just became head designer at Louis Vuitton. And my friend Tommy Ton is a very well known and respected photographer, but he just designed his first collection. James Jebbia won the Men‚Äôs Fashion Designer of the Year award and in his acceptance speech he first started off clarifying to the audience that he‚Äôs not a fashion designer! Traditions are being broken and shaken up. There is no longer one lane to follow. People are creating their own lanes. This is very exciting and inspiring for me.     
 The model returned to the runway at Paris Fashion Week.  Cara Delevingne seldom walks fashion shows anymore, but today she made a grand return to the runway at Paris Fashion Week. The model-turned-actress opened and closed Balmain's Spring 2019 show‚Äîwhile lip syncing, no less.  Kicking off the show, Delevingne walked the runway while singing along as Prince's "When Doves Cry" blasted through the venue. She wore a sweeping white jacket with strong shoulder pads, matching high-waisted pants, and a metal futuristic bra top from the 1980s-inspired collection.   @caradelevingne lip-syncing ‚ÄúWhen Doves Cry‚Äù to open @balmain, and designer @olivier_rousteing darting among the models at its close. Video and photo by @matthewschneier A post shared by  New York Times Fashion & Style (@nytimesfashion) on Sep 28, 2018 at 3:44am PDT Making a second appearance, Delevingne also closed out the show as the final look in a white and black outfit. As the Balmain Army stormed the runway for the finale walk, she walked alongside Balmain creative director Olivier Rousteing while a medley of '80s hits played.  Her appearance was a surprise one, as Delevingne has famously put her fashion career on the back burner since pursuing acting and opting to focus more on her mental wellbeing. In the past, she's opened up about the effects modeling had on her depression. In a 2016 essay for TIME, she wrote: Earlier this year, Delevingne also briefly came out of her runway retirement for Christopher Bailey's final show as creative director at Burberry. She wore a colorful rainbow fur coat in the Fall 2018 show that celebrated LGBTQ pride. 
 The designer celebrates her brand's 10-year anniversary in the perfect way.  Victoria Beckham has come a long way since 2008. Back then, the former Spice Girl was just making her first foray into the fashion industry‚Äîand she made it with a splash by starring in an instantly iconic ad campaign for Marc Jacobs. Now, ten years later, Beckham is celebrating a decade of her own namesake brand by recreating those famous shopping bag ads.    Ahead of her tenth anniversary show at London Fashion Week, Beckham tapped Juergen Teller (who also photographed her Marc Jacobs campaign) to recreate the ads with her own brand's shopping bags this time. Coming full circle, the new images are a playful nod to her start in fashion.  "When Marc Jacobs featured me coming out of a shopping bag a decade ago it really was just the beginning of my journey into the fashion industry. It was funny and ironic and brilliantly captured by Juergen Teller. And it came out just as I was about to present my debut collection. So what better way of illustrating the story of the past ten years than by revisiting the creative but this time with my own branded bag," Beckham said in a statement from the brand.  Before she recreated the iconic ads, however, she made sure to get Marc Jacobs' approval, "Marc gave me his blessing to recreate the shot and Juergen agreed to collaborate with me again which was just incredible, and him appearing in one of the images was really important to me. The collaboration with him was incredibly special and I wanted to document it," Beckham explained.  For those who can appreciate this throwback piece of truly iconic fashion history,  you can now shop the famous ad in t-shirt form on Victoria Beckham's site. Retailing for $150, the shirt is now available for a limited amount of time.   
 From sketch to celebrity. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. Fast fashion may make it seem like clothes just magically appear overnight, but the truth is that it takes hours and hours of work and hundreds of skilled individuals to make just one dress worthy of walking the red carpet. Think couture-level dedication to embroidery, fit, and pattern. While coming up with a design may seem like the hardest part, it doesn't get much easier from there. The process also involves choosing the right fabric, creating the very first sample, communicating with teams around the globe, and weighing the opinions of dozens of people. From the initial sketch to the final red carpet strut, take a look at how a custom dress really gets made.
 The actress talks cowboy boots and prairie dresses for the fall season.  These looks remind me so much of the clothes I wore growing up in the South. I was always dressing in prairie skirts and cowboy boots when I was little. I loved to watch Little House on the Prairie and play cowgirl. My favorite childhood memories are rooted in country music, doing square dances in cowboy boots. I learned to clog- and line-dance before I learned the fox-trot. I‚Äôm very influenced by country singers like Loretta Lynn, and, of course, Dolly Parton is my biggest idol. And I loved all the gorgeous long, flowing lace dresses Sissy Spacek wore when she played Loretta Lynn in Coal Miner‚Äôs Daughter. Western is such a huge style in Nashville. There was a famous designer named Nudie, and everyone from Johnny Cash to Dolly Parton wore his suits. The clothes have real Western flair. It‚Äôs so cool to see the look being recognized now as a global fashion trend. Maybe it‚Äôs about returning to a time and place that people find comforting and when everything seemed simpler. But it‚Äôs always been a part of my life. I mean, you‚Äôre talking to the girl who wore cowboy boots to her own wedding reception. I switched out my gown and heels for a short dress and cowboy boots because they‚Äôre comfortable and fun to dance in. I do love the look of a pretty dress or a floor-sweeping skirt with cowboy boots. It‚Äôs feminine and a little rugged, which encapsulates my personality.  I remember being in fifth grade and begging my grandmother to buy me a prairie skirt, and when she finally did I wore it every day with white cowboy boots. I‚Äôm definitely a dress-or-denim-skirt-and-cowboy-boots sort of girl. Every time I put on a pair, I feel like I‚Äôm back home. It‚Äôs so funny because my daughter just walked into my room wearing an off-the-shoulder vintage prairie dress‚Äîshe‚Äôs so on trend. Except that she was wearing sneakers, and I was like, ‚ÄúI wish you had some boots on.‚Äù I have so many pairs of cowboy boots; I buy them new from Betty Boots when I‚Äôm in Nashville. And I buy every single one of my kids cowboy boots, and they wear them until they fall off. I also wear mine until they‚Äôre threadbare. They look better when the leather is worn-out, then I resole them. The intricate stitching and detail on Western shirts are so pretty and add a little something, as do tasseled bags and purses. And I love cowboy hats, obviously. They‚Äôre beautiful, and they give a prairie dress or skirt that something extra. The best versions are those that aren‚Äôt overly embellished. I can wear a cowboy hat with anything‚Äîyou have to own it. For an easy and chic way to incorporate a bit of Western into your wardrobe, I like the idea of a chambray shirt over a dress. We work a different iteration of the chambray and Western shirt into our Draper James collection [Witherspoon‚Äôs fashion label, which she launched in 2015] each season. For us down South, it‚Äôs the perfect layering piece because it‚Äôs so hot. Our Draper James chambray shirts and jeans are made in Blue Ridge, Georgia, by these wonderful women who have been making blue jeans for 40 years. It‚Äôs an honor to be part of that tradition. I think there‚Äôs a mood for wanting to celebrate classic Americana right now. The whole Western look is very romantic, and there‚Äôs no beating that wearability and durability factor.

 Dior, Tom Ford, and Vetements are all on loan. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. Supermodel Natalia Vodianova has found great success in the fashion industry with her numerous runway walks and memorable photo shoots, and is also known for her lucrative contract with Calvin Klein. The mother-of-five is also a well-known philanthropist who founded the Naked Heart Foundation in 2004, a Russian-based charity that provides play facilities for underprivileged children with special needs. Given her fashion and philanthropic background, it's no surprise that she is now combining both worlds with help from peer-to-peer fashion rental site Villageluxe.   The e-commerce company recently launched its philanthropic initiative, Charity Closets, and it tapped Vodianova to help kick things off. On loan are 24 fabulous items straight from her closet in Paris, where 100 percent of Vodianova's earnings as a lender will be donated to her Naked Heart Foundation charity. In the spirit of giving, Villageluxe is also donating a portion of its borrower fee to Vodianova's charitable cause. "I'm really passionate about Villageluxe," said Vodianova in a statement. "Together, we can benefit charities around the world by opening our closets and our hearts with Charity Closets. I invite all of you to rent these special pieces, lend your own, lift women up, and save the planet while doing it!"  Below are a few of the standout pieces we wouldn't mind adding to our closet.   On my way ‚ù§Ô∏èüë† üöò A post shared by  Natalia Vodianova (@natasupernova) on Jul 1, 2018 at 8:44am PDT Vodianova shared a snapshot to her Instagram of herself in a leopard-print Vetements minidress with long sleeves. This exact dress retails for $990 but can be rented for $125 a week. Consider adding a pair of embossed leather sandals from Christian Louboutin ($1160 retail and $100 rental fee) to complete your outfit.

The floral-print dress is available for rent at $250 and retails at $5,000. She previously wore a black Tom Ford tuxedo ($5,200 retail and $500 rental) to attend  the Berluti Men's Fall/Winter 2015 show in Paris. Vodianova was spotted arriving at Nice airport during the 2017 Cannes Film Festival carrying a Louis Vuitton x Jeff Koons Palm Springs backpack. The limited edition bag features Leonardo da Vinci's famous Mona Lisa motif and retails for $3,200 but you can borrow it for just $200.  All 24 pieces from Vodianova's Charity Closet donation can be shipped across the United States and can be messengered or picked up in New York City.

 Whether you want vegan, faux, or the real deal.  If you think about every cool girl depicted on TV and every off-duty supermodel strutting down the street, they always tend to have one thing in common: the best leather jackets resting on their shoulders. With their edgy vibes and timeless allure, leather jackets are the ruling monarchs of the outerwear world. To keep your favorite staple modern, shop the best of the season now. Whether you're into vegan, faux, or the real deal, click through to shop all our favorites. Trust us; they're worth the investment. Because of its simple, classic style, this jacket is a timeless staple that¬†can be worn year after year.¬† Remaining right on board with late '80s and '90s-inspired dressing comes the fringe jacket. The Spring 2019 catwalks boasted fringe in all its glorious forms; leather coats, dresses and box bags.¬† All the vegans out there, rejoice. This buttery soption from Jonathan Simkhai cinches the waist and features a balloon sleeve that'll rival every coat in your closet.¬† The classic trench coat and the staple leather jacket are wardrobe essentials, but Fleur Du Mal's version gives the two timeless outerwear pieces a major twist.¬† If you're looking to make a serious investment, this is it. The Balenciaga iteration has all the markings of a classic biker jacket with the added brand shoulder shape signature.¬† For a classic, but affordable biker style in an unexpected creamy hue.¬† If the biker style isn't your look, this sleek trench is perfect for an elegant take on leather.¬† As we all know, prints are here to stay, so why not dip your toes into the printed jacket trend? With a leather option like this, wearing all black becomes a bit more interesting.¬† You've probably seen this puffy leather coat¬†floating around on influencers, editors, and stylists alike. This black version can be styled with anything from a cropped trousers to a gingham skirt.¬† Add a subtle upgrade to your look with this cognac shade.¬† This boxy faux leather option is anything but ordinary; it comes in a beautiful dark navy. Open front jackets can double as a standalone outerwear piece or as a layering option. This J Brand jacket is versatile enough to throw on over a dress, and light enough to bundle beneath.¬† Done in a smooth camel hue, this patent leather jacket is a fresh take on a double-breasted coat.¬† The bomber jacket is the sporty alternative to a leather biker. You can wear this updated outerwear staple with everything, from worn-in Levi's to a knitted midi dress.¬† Croc embossed pieces have taken over in the form of block heeled boots and mini crossbody bags. This year, we're embracing the edgy style¬†as outerwear.¬†
 Your wish list calls for double denim, timeless trenches, and floral fantasies. As an intelligent, fashion literate woman of style, you‚Äôve moved beyond trends. Trends are the enemy of longevity; the death of individuality. Trends, as you have read repeatedly, are over, although you recognize that this may be a question of semantics. Switch the word ‚Äútrends‚Äù for ‚Äúupdates‚Äù or ‚Äúevolution‚Äù or ‚Äúrefreshers,‚Äù and trends start to seem not only relevant but vital. Also, you cannot help observing that without trends there is no momentum, no moving forward (even if sometimes the shift seems to be back to a previous era). So like a tech junkie hovering over her cell phone on a de-connectivity retreat or a Wall Street wolf prowling the Nasdaq, you find yourself scrolling through hundreds of runway images at the start of each season‚Äîjust so you can reject them. Obviously.  This is okay. Think of trends as software, what you do with them as coding, and the results as a newly upgraded, high-functioning closet. That makes the process sound important and advanced. Which it is. First, the overview. Lengths are still long, jackets are still oversize, the suit continues to make headway back into the mainstream, and florals will never die. What adds newness, nowness, and freshness are ingenious details, novel styling permutations, and innovative fabrics. Take the suit: At Calvin Klein, chief creative officer Raf Simons sent out a new alternative in matching tones of dark denim, with colorful topstitching (one of fall‚Äôs major micro details, and that‚Äôs not a contradiction; style is all about small but telling stealth flourishes). The unlikely combination of matching double denim, hailed as the new suiting, is a masterstroke‚Äîthe missing step in the suit‚Äôs rehabilitation in our daily lives. If the double dose is too caffeinated for your taste, at least consider denim in its upgraded, couture-y iteration. At Dior, for instance, Maria Grazia Chiuri has tailored it into the perfect wear-anywhere pants (‚Äújeans‚Äù may be the proper term, but it fails to communicate any of Dior‚Äôs refinement). Chiuri, Dior‚Äôs first-ever female artistic director, has an inestimable advantage over all of her predecessors‚Äîshe can wear the clothes herself, mixing those low-slung, perfectly calibrated jeans with an ultralightweight rendition of Christian Dior‚Äôs classic Bar jacket. ‚ÄúI believe in real life, women mix clothes‚Äîa beautiful jacket with jeans. That‚Äôs how I dress,‚Äù Chiuri says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs practical, but it‚Äôs beautiful.‚Äù Denim with satin, denim with sequins, khaki with velvet‚Äîsometimes it appears that the key to unlocking modern style is in the high-low mix. It‚Äôs probably no coincidence, then, that along with denim‚Äôs return to the agenda, feathers, seemingly denim‚Äôs oppositional force, are also back. Thanks to Miuccia Prada, who sent models out in a halo of ostrich and marabou feathers this season and last, you can now swathe yourself in them from the neck down. For those wanting a smaller dose, a skirt or wrist trim should do the trick.  For something more robust but equally glamorous, shearling (again, thanks to Mrs. Prada) is more glamorous than ever, dunked in vivid Hockney-esque hues and combed, softened, and generally subjected to a dazzling range of treatments. Like the supple patent leathers that Proenza Schouler molded into sleek but subtle reinterpretations of body-con, this fits the unstoppable march of utility luxe, which is good to behold because you know that these pieces combine function, beauty, and longevity. The aforementioned sequins are back too‚Äîas seen at Saint Laurent, Givenchy, Osman, Libertine. It might be easier to tag where they didn‚Äôt turn up. That‚Äôs quite a turnaround for a trend that even a season ago seemed a little blingsome. As a head-to-toe look, sequins are hard to outshine, literally, and are the optimal match for fall‚Äôs loose, simple-looking columns and slip-gowns. If you‚Äôre wearing a sequined skirt or tunic, the ideal partner is one that provides a knowing contrast, whether it‚Äôs a tailored navy blazer, a simple white tee, or a trench. Just add velvet slides (Gianvito Rossi or Ancient Greek Sandals) or chunky platforms (Gabriela Hearst). Speaking of the trench coat, if we‚Äôd all bought shares in Aquascutum‚Äôs invention back in 1914 we‚Äôd now be on a yacht in the Caribbean. Then again, there‚Äôs not much scope for trench-wearing in St. Barts, so maybe it‚Äôs more fun this way. Trenches are so interesting for 2017, reworked as dresses and gilets and generally so luxurious, you can forget about fur (unless it‚Äôs shearling). C√©line keeps sending them out, in classic black tuxedo styles as well as oversize versions in fail-safe shades of off-white, soft blue, and army green. Dior showed them too‚Äîfor resort. Put matter-of-factly, they sound straightforward. But the results are so sensationally chic, effortless, and transformational, you‚Äôll wear yours with everything, including next summer‚Äôs dresses. Which is fine, because that‚Äôs a look too. Then there‚Äôs Tibi‚Äôs trench for Resort 2018, though it‚Äôs more like a frock‚Äìtrench coat (a French coat, maybe?). Note the resort part of this equation. Trenches are now a year-round ally. In silk or velvet, they‚Äôre also 24-7. ‚ÄúSo much of fashion today is about context,‚Äù says Valentino's Pierpaolo Piccioli  If this sounds a little too pragmatic, rest assured that there‚Äôs plenty of fantasy and whimsy this season. At Alexander McQueen, Sarah Burton distilled all her inspirations from a fact-finding tour of Cornwall, the most remote southwestern tip of England. The resulting collection was one of her most confident and beautiful, filled with whipstitched leather and knits, trailing threads, metallic mesh, and exquisite sheer tulle gowns embroidered with sparkling jet and silver stars. Despite its dream-like detachment from the mainstream, Burton‚Äôs show tapped into many of fashion‚Äôs latest trends‚Äîsorry, preoccupations. I think there‚Äôs a lesson for all of us here. Trend awareness is not about being a literalist but about tapping into moods and keeping current‚Äîin your own way. Checks? Burton had tweed interwoven with bright twisted yarns and chiffon strips. Victoria Beckham also embraced houndstooth with her slouchy, oversize take on the pantsuit, as did Simons with his pant- and skirt-suiting and plastic-covered coats for Calvin Klein. Then there were Off-White‚Äôs cropped checked bombers‚Äîthe check is not sitting this one out. It‚Äôs pulling out all the stops, which is excellent news for those of us who want to break into print without wearing florals. But florals are everywhere, and they‚Äôre heady, usually set against vivid dark backgrounds (Alexander McQueen, Isabel Marant, Altuzarra, Michael Kors, and countless others), and sophisticated rather than twee: You can picture a gallerista wearing them. You can even see her stepping away from her habitual monochrome into red, which is becoming a new anchor color. Mixed with pink or burgundy, it‚Äôs acquiring a patina of complexity‚Äîmore of a long smolder than a quick-fire blaze. ‚ÄúSo much of fashion today is about context,‚Äù says Pierpaolo Piccioli, the creative director of Valentino. ‚ÄúRed has sometimes been seen as a bit too much, maybe too obvious at times. And pink? People see it as too soft. But mix them and something different and interesting happens.‚Äù The same could be said of fashion in general and personal style in particular. They don‚Äôt need to be radically upended each season. Sometimes the subtlest switch is all it takes to reset. Lisa Armstrong is fashion director of The Telegraph. This article originally appeared in the September 2017 issue of Harper's BAZAAR.
 This is the model's second time designing for the brand.  It's been a year since Gigi Hadid and Stuart Weitzman collaborated on a shoe together, and today the brand has released the supermodel's two new exclusive footwear styles for fall.  The Gigi mules named, "eyelove" and "eyelovemore" are suede pointed-toe flats that incorporate the mystical symbol the "evil eye". The toe boxes are lined with shearling to keep you warm through the colder months, but easily transition back into spring.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôve really been into slides lately and wanted a pair that can take me into fall‚Ä¶no more cold toes! The evil eye is a powerful symbol meant to protect those who wear it from negative energies. It‚Äôs emotionally comforting and beautiful and captivating to look at. The bright colors are fun and remind me why we designed these shoes ‚Äî they represent our commitment to build three additional schools with Pencils of Promise. Look Good, Do Good,‚Äù said Hadid who also stars in a campaign video for her collaboration. The 22-year-old supermodel, who has fronted ad campaigns for the shoe brand since 2015, traded in her lace-up ankle boots for mules this summer. She was spotted rocking Stuart Weitzman's Mulearky flats all over town‚Äîfrom her Victoria's Secret fittings to date night with boyfriend Zayn Malik. So it's easy to see why she wanted to design her very own.
 We chat with Mashburn about investing in classics and her perfect collection of vintage denim shorts. In this series for Harper‚Äôs Bazaar, I will be ‚Äúoutfit dissecting‚Äù women who work behind the scenes in the fashion industry. The women you will meet in these profiles work for some of your favorite brands, and whether they‚Äôre designing the pieces you love or answering your DM questions, they are also quietly cultivating trends. I traveled back to Atlanta to interview Elizabeth Mashburn in her home in Buckhead‚Äîa place that looks as casually chic and cool as Elizabeth always does. In the early days of the Ann Mashburn store, I would admire how she effortlessly put together classic pieces with a twist. Later, as a store and office intern for Mashburn, I got to see her creative work from start to finish. We chatted about investing in classics (Ann Mashburn is a great place to start‚Äîyou can‚Äôt go wrong with the Icon Shirt), her perfect collection of vintage denim shorts, and Belgian shoes.  Name... Elizabeth Mashburn What do you do all day? Copywriting and general creative things. I write copy about new products that launch online; I create email campaigns to sell those new products; I do things like window decals for stores. Anything that needs to be creative or designed, or made to sound better is what I‚Äôm tasked with.  How would you describe what you do to a toddler? I write little stories about pieces of clothing so that you can decide whether or not you want to buy it.   So you did the first logo for Sid Masburn? Yes! It was a font that my dad had on his computer and really liked. I started to see it in other logos; I think there‚Äôs a valet parking company in Buckhead that uses the font or a general contractor. We started to feel like it was a little stiff so, probably in 2013, I did it again by hand.  Where do you live and where did you grow up? I live in Atlanta, but I've moved around a ton. My phone number is a Madison, Wisconsin area code. I was born in New York, then we moved out to Connecticut. We were in San Diego for a year, Charlottesville, Virginia for a year. Went back to New York, then we were in Madison. I moved to Atlanta in 2007, when my parents were starting their business. I was in my last year of high school, so I was totally checked out. I was very interested in what they were doing business-wise, but I didn't know anything about Atlanta. I spent my time at my parents' house, school, and the store‚Äîthat was it.   Since you moved around so much, what place do you identify with most? Kind of nowhere! I love Atlanta, but I do not feel like I am from Atlanta. I think that‚Äôs why my family and I are so close; because we all are kind of from nowhere. All the little provincial print shirts, I‚Äôm like ‚Äúthat seems like home.‚Äù Even though it feels like five different versions of home, we had napkins out of that fabric growing up. Home is wherever my family is!  Do you think one place had a major effect on your style, or is it the combination of all of them? I mean, my parents had the biggest influence on my style. I always wanted to look like them. Actually, I had a brief phase where I didn‚Äôt.  What were your outfits during that phase? I wore black. I was still dressing like them, I was just like ‚Äúmy parents don‚Äôt look like other parents.‚Äù I‚Äôve always dressed exactly the same.   That‚Äôs one thing I love about you; you have extremely consistent style. I really value that in people!  Well, you do too! Which I guess is why you value it!   So many people can change so fast. Wear one thing one year and then change the next. I‚Äôve never mentally been able to wrap my head around that!  It‚Äôs very wasteful! Every piece of fashion writing in the entire world talks about investing in classics. It doesn't make me feel good to lean into a trend and be really tired of it. I get very tired of seeing everyone wearing the same thing, and I think that‚Äôs fine and fun, and it‚Äôs great to participate in trends and moments, but when I think about the things that I actually wear, I want to wear the same three sweaters over and over again. I want to wear the same lug sole until I can't anymore.    Tell me the story behind something you‚Äôre wearing right now. The shorts belonged to my mom‚Äôs brother, who passed away sadly before I was born, but they were his old jeans. She had a bunch of his jeans in her closet, they were super close, a year apart, they were best friends. So, she had all his old Levi‚Äôs in her closet and I cut them off into shorts when I was probably 18 or 19. They are the best! She said, ‚Äúhe would have loved to see you wearing those!‚Äù I‚Äôve patched the back‚Äîthey‚Äôre very old! My white shorts are his jeans too. Whatever his size was is exactly perfect!  How would you describe your style? A lot of things I wear are well loved and have a lot of wear behind them. There are definitely some old school preppy classic things about the way I like to dress. Matt Lambert has described it as ‚ÄúWASP-Goth‚Äù before, which is a studded belt, Levis, and Belgian Shoes. Definitely more in the winter. Goth is a little heavy! I‚Äôm going to show you my wedding dress. There is a part of me that really loves things that look like they are made for babies. I love fluttery sleeves. I made the dress with my mom and Lan. We did this little embroidery that I had drawn out. We made shirts in this organdy fabric. What do you buy ‚Äútoo much‚Äù of? I‚Äôm always looking for anything in a French provincial print. I cannot resist anything that is that kind of print. Mostly because it‚Äôs not being made anymore. I also probably should be buying more loafers since I end up wearing those all the time. I can never resist a fluttery top.    If you could be dropped in any time period strictly for the clothes what would you pick? Early 60‚Äôs is always really great to me. But also, the movie The Favorite, is so pretty. I was so inspired by it.  What movie had the biggest influence on your style? Virgin Suicides was huge for me and my sisters. I don‚Äôt know if anything they wear is literally what I own or wear, but several people said my wedding dress felt very Virgin Suicides. We watched that movie over and over again. Everything about that movie aesthetically I love and identify with, obviously until the end. My sisters and I all shared stuff, but we all have really different style now.  I think there is a connecting style dot between all of y‚Äôall still!  I mean, Harriet Mashburn wears velcro Stan Smiths, skinny blue J.Brands, and a different Boyfriend Shirt everyday!   What are 5 songs you always play? 
 It just debuted in Paris two weeks ago. In just three years, Off-White has quickly become regarded as one of the coolest brands out right now. It's no surprise considering creative director Virgil Abloh, formerly the creative director to Kanye West, has his finger on the pulse of everything cool, and ultimately has become the trendsetter himself. He also counts some of the most stylish girls like Kendall Jenner, Hailey Baldwin and twins Simi and Haze Khadra as friends, and a constant source of inspiration.  Just two weeks ago Off-White showed their Fall 2018 collection during Paris Fashion Week, to a star-studded front row and equally star-studded model lineup. While you'll have to wait months to get your hands on the cool Esquestrian-inspired ready-to-wear, starting Monday you can pick up one little piece of the runway. Off-White will officially launch their new sunglasses in partnership with Luxottica on March 20th. In a new campaign, the unisex frames are modeled by SimiHaze, the LA-based twin models/DJs, alongside male model-of-the-moment Alton Mason. The trio is dressed up in Off-White threads of course, hanging around a vintage car, looking as trendy as ever. The seven-piece collection has a little something for everyone‚Äîwhether you like square frames, oval or maybe you're more partial to a timeless cat-eye, available in pink, black and tortoise. No matter what your style, these frames are sure to up your cool factor regardless of what you pair them with. You can buy a pair on sunglasshut.com, for $179 starting Monday, March 20th.
 The allegations stretch back to 1982.  Photographer Bruce Weber has been accused of sexual misconduct by more male models, according to a report in The Business of Fashion. Over the weekend, the New York Times published a story with allegations from 15 current and former male models. The Times story also included 13 male assistants who accused Mario Testino of unwanted sexual advances.  On Wednesday morning, The Business of Fashion published a report with four more sources going on the record against Weber, and more speaking anonymously. The allegations date back to 1982.  One of those men is D.L. Janney, who described an incident that happened while he was shooting for British Vogue in 1982. During the shoot, Weber asked Janney to strip down to his underwear. He told the model that he wanted to take pictures to send to Calvin Klein (Weber was shooting their campaigns at the time). Weber asked Janney to get completely nude and said the photos wouldn't be published. Janney refused and said that Weber refused to talk to him for the rest of the shoot.  Another man, Christopher Cates, described an incident from 2006. Cates was modeling at Weber's home in Miami when the photographer asked him to go upstairs to another room, away from the rest of the crew. When Weber entered the room, he asked Cates to undress and touched  him inappropriately, according to The Business of Fashion.  In the article, two other men described similar situations, and Jason Boyce, the former model who recently filed suit against Weber, described a "shrug it off" culture around the famous photographer.  "Anytime you‚Äôd bring up Bruce it was always like, ‚ÄòOh yeah he‚Äôs a little weird, he‚Äôs a little creepy, he does these weird breathing exercises,‚Äô‚Äù Boyce said to The Business of Fashion. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs as far as anyone would talk about it. No one would ever fully-fledged say he assaulted me. It was always like a shrug it off, ‚ÄòOh well, let‚Äôs not make this a big deal,‚Äô as men do, ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs not make this a big deal.‚Äô‚Äù  Boyce's attorney, Lisa Bloom, said that since they filed suit, many more male models have come to her with similar allegations against Weber. When The Business of Fashion reached out to Weber for comment, his representative said he stands by the statement he gave to the Times: ‚ÄúI'm completely shocked and saddened by the outrageous claims being made against me, which I absolutely deny. I have used common breathing exercises and professionally photographed thousands of nude models over my career, but never touched anyone inappropriately. Given my life‚Äôs work, these twisted and untrue allegations are truly disheartening. I've been taking pictures for over 40 years and have the utmost respect for everyone I've ever photographed. I would never, ever, try to hurt anyone or prevent someone from succeeding ‚Äî it‚Äôs just not in my character.‚Äù

 Say bonjour to Les Reveries, the ready-to-wear brand on the top of our wish list... As a digital editor I more often than not see clothing and accessories for the first time on a screen and then try to see pieces in person to determine if the quality, tailoring and overall desirability is there. Les Reveries, a brand founded by the pretty and petite designing sister pair Ai Ly and Wayne Lee, was the rare exception that stopped me in my tracks (in real life) when I saw one of their backless silk gowns on a chic public relations director. Their dresses are part '90s slip dress, part floral la boh√®me for a cool girl approach to feminine style. Those gowns are offset with mini dresses with subtle ruffle detail, camis and layering pieces like fitted turtlnecks, t-shirts with French phrases and hoodies. Net-a-Porter has recently solidified its efforts to work with up-and-coming brands and talent with The Vanguard program. Each season, up to four designers will be offered a comprehensive mentorship with training and guidance from the e-commerce giant's global team. This season Les Reveries is in that rarefied pack, along with Ruh, Gu_de, and Martinez. We got even more up close and person with the duo to get to the heart of their inspiration and the girls that have them dreaming up their second collection.  What is it like to work with your sister?  Wayne: Interestingly because we are sisters we find it easy to agree and also to disagree. We‚Äôve always had similar tastes in music and clothes but what makes working together so much more effective is when we disagree and bring in other interests of ours into the design process.

Ai: Since it‚Äôs just the two us now we have our hands in everything. Why did you want to launch Les Reveries?  Wayne: We found ourselves not being able to find the perfect going-out dress so we decided to make it. What is your design process? Ai: Our design process is pretty organic. Its erratic and it comes in waves and usually we have to have a notebook with us all times to jot down spurts of ideas during our commute or while strolling around the city running errands. What did you feel was missing in the market and it made you want to launch? Ai: We wanted to make a dress line which is feminine, elegant, effortless and affordable. What are both your backgrounds? Wayne: We both have worked in the fashion industry for many years with design backgrounds. How would you describe your aesthetic? Wayne: Feminine, playful, modern and whimsical. Are there any particular women who inspire you? Wayne: Coco Chanel and Anais Nin Ai: Louise Bourgeois and Charlotte Rampling Any places that inspire you? Ai: The country side and seaside, flower gardens, libraries, museums and music festivals.
 Same.  With its over-the-top runway shows, iconic quilted logo bags, and 108-year brand history, we've always known Chanel was one of the top luxury fashion houses in the world. But yesterday, for the first time ever, the brand released its annual earning report to the public, revealing it garnered a cool $9.62 billion in sales last year.  At nearly $10 billion in sales from 2017 alone, Chanel surpasses many of its rival luxury fashion houses like Gucci, which earned $7.1 billion in 2017. Though LVMH doesn't reveal the individual earnings of each of its luxury brands, it's estimated that Louis Vuitton brings in somewhere between $9.28 billion and $11.6 billion annually.  The report revealed Chanel's sales for 2017 were up 11% from the previous year. It also detailed that the fashion house spent a whopping $1.46 billion last year on its extravagant runway shows and international custom events alone (which is no surprise when you think of all its over-the-top runway moments‚Äîahem the actual cruise ship it put on the runway pictured above).  While the brand's decision to release its earnings for the first time ever could indicate it was perhaps interested in selling, Philippe Blondiaux, Chanel's chief financial officer, disputed that rumor.  And that concludes today's lesson in How To Hit 'Em With The Receipts 101.   
 This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. California is officially becoming the first state to ban the sale and manufacture of new fur products.  On Saturday, Governor Gavin Newsom signed two new animal rights bills into law. In addition to the history-making fur-banning bill, Newsom also signed off on a bill that makes California the third state to bar most animals from performing in circuses.  Under the state's new fur law, residents will be barred from selling or making clothing, shoes, or handbags with fur beginning in 2023. California previously passed laws outlawing fur trapping and two major cities in the state, Los Angeles and San Francisco, had already banned fur sales.   "California is a leader when it comes to animal welfare, and today that leadership includes banning the sale of fur,‚Äù Newsom said in a statement. "But we are doing more than that. We are making a statement to the world that beautiful wild animals like bears and tigers have no place on trapeze wires or jumping through flames." The new bills have also earned praise from animal rights groups and activists.  Kitty Block, CEO and president of the Humane Society of the United States said in a statement:  There are some exceptions to California's fur ban, which doesn't apply to any used products (meaning thrifting fur will still be legal in the state) or to clothing used for religious or tribal purposes. The ban also "excludes the sale of leather, dog and cat fur, cowhides, deer, sheep and goat skin, and anything preserved through taxidermy," according to the Associated Press.  Still, the law could have a  significant impact on the fur industry, which brought in $1.5 billion in U.S. retail sales in 2014, according to the Fur Information Council's most recent data. Violating the law will be punishable with a fine of up to $1,000 in California. 
 The look is from Virgil Abloh's 'Queen' collection.  Just days after the French Open's sexist ban of Serena William's life-saving body compression catsuit, the tennis star made a triumphant return to the US Open in another head-turning look: a one-shouldered tutu dress designed by Virgil Abloh.  The incredible ballerina-inspired dress is part of Virgil Abloh's Off-White x Nike collection inspired by Serena and aptly called "QUEEN." Topping it off, she wore a pair of sparkling silver sneakers that are also part of the collection, which will be available to shop online soon.    Along with serving this major LEWK on the court, Serena also served up a winning game in her match against Magda Linette. It was her first US Open match since giving birth to daughter Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr., who turns one this week. Following a difficult pregnancy and life-threatening birthing complications, the athlete's quick return to the sport is nothing short of amazing.  Serena's Off-White x Nike tutu dress is just one of several pieces included in Virgil Abloh's limited-edition "QUEEN" collection. Inspired by the iconic tennis star, the range of pieces includes tutu tennis dresses, a sleek bomber jacket, and several sneaker styles.  "With Serena, we have one of our generation's most powerful, inspiring athletes as the muse," Abloh said in a statement from the brand, "I was trying to embody her spirit and bring something compelling and fresh to tennis." On Instagram, the Off-White founder and artistic director at Louis Vuitton Men's shared his excitement over the US Open look writing, "willing to design dresses for her for life."  willing to design dresses for her for life. A post shared by @ virgilabloh on Aug 27, 2018 at 7:05pm PDT Let's just hope no tennis officials have the nerve to say anything about Serena's latest outfit on the court.

 Kathleen Frey and Sonne Bajwa won the Marketing Plan award at the second annual Infor/FIT Fashion Design ICONS Awards. It's a long journey from the runway to the red carpet to reality. And often, the one thing that turns a designer into a breakout star is forceful marketing. Earlier this month, Kathleen Frey and Sonne Bajwa‚Äîtwo international trade and marketing students at New York‚Äôs Fashion Institute of Technology (FIT)‚Äîwere recognized for their innovative strategies as the 2017 Marketing Plan winners at the second annual Infor/FIT Fashion Design ICONS Awards.  Infor, the leading provider of cloud applications for fashion and retail, teamed up with FIT and Hearst Magazines for the awards‚Äîa two-part competition that explores the collaboration between designers and business teams. The winning gown design, which was envisioned by Brandon Johnson, will be worn by fashion influencer and founder of Friend of a Friend Olivia Perez at the Harper‚Äôs BAZAAR ICONS event during New York Fashion Week in September.  Four fashion industry experts served as judges: fashion consultant Marigay McKee, jewelry designer Temple St. Clair, Macy‚Äôs fashion director Durand Guion, and Infor‚Äôs chief creative officer Marc Scibelli.   After Johnson won the Fashion Design award with a piece inspired by his mother's pearls, Frey and Bajwa accepted the challenge for the business award, which came with the herculean task of marketing the dress via e-commerce and at 50 Macy‚Äôs stores. The goal was lofty: Sell 1,000 dresses in three months.    And while it may sound like an intimidating target, the kind of technology available today (such as Infor‚Äôs CX Suite) enabled Bajwa and Frey to get creative. So they put together a cohesive multi-platform plan, which was evaluated with a several important points in mind: strategy, research quality, persuasiveness, presentation, and feasibility.   ‚ÄúWe crafted a marketing plan with a firm foundation in Brandon‚Äôs versatile design aesthetic, capitalizing on Olivia‚Äôs influence and her followers, and using Macy‚Äôs strategy as a compass to keep everything in line. The overarching theme is to make the product engaging‚Äîbe it through a seamless purchasing experience, in-store features, or even through store associates.‚Äù Bajwa said.    Another point they considered: their mercurial demographic.   ‚ÄúWe did a lot of research on the psychographics of millennials and what they value in retailers,‚Äù Frey said. ‚ÄúWe found that while they are more price sensitive than brand loyal, they value engagement above all else. With that in mind, we wanted to take Macy‚Äôs omni-channel approach one step further. Technology is an integral part of our business plan because we‚Äôre hoping to engage with our consumers across all platforms: the website, the app, Instagram shopping. It allows us to study our consumers and understand them a little bit more.‚Äù In other words, it takes a smarter seller to attract a smart shopper.
 Virginie Ward, Chanel's creative studio director, stepped out in his place.  Karl Lagerfeld did not take the final bow at the Chanel Haute Couture Spring 2019 shows in Paris today, WWD reports. Instead, his right-hand, Virginie Viard, stepped out at the end of the show to greet the audience.  In a statement to WWD, Chanel explained that Lagerfeld "was feeling tired" and "asked Virginie Viard, director of the creative studio of the house, to represent him and greet the guests alongside the bride."  For her bow, Viard was accompanied by model Vittoria Ceretti dressed in the final look‚Äîan embellished cut-out bathing suit and a matching swim cap with a cascading veil.  "Virginie Viard as creative studio director and Eric Pfrunder as Chanel‚Äôs director of image continue to work with him and follow through with the brand‚Äôs collections and image campaigns," the French fashion house added in the statement. After the first showing at 10 a.m. local time, an announcer said Lagerfeld would appear for the second presentation at noon. After he missed the second show, the announcer said, "We wish Mr. Lagerfeld to recover quickly," without providing further details, WWD reports. 
  Viard has worked for 30 years by Lagerfeld's side. "I coordinate the teams, liaise with suppliers and choose fabrics," she told The Telegraph of her current role. Then, of course, I do fittings with Karl. As soon as I receive his sketches, the process begins. I try to please him, but I like to surprise him too."  She and Lagerfeld have a close friendship, Viard added to the British outlet. They "speak all the time" and "see each other every other day;" he even sends her sketches via phone.  The Grand Palais was transformed once again into a fantastical setting for Chanel's latest couture offering. This time, the iconic French venue was reimagined as a Mediterranean villa, AKA Villa Chanel, complete with palm trees, and outdoor garden setting, and a pool.   
 I will be taking personal time off to recover from this performance. Anyone who's ever seen Billy Porter step out in clothing knows that the actor is all about theatrics. After seeing his fuchsia-lined cape at the Golden Globes, his Christian Siriano tuxedo gown at the Oscars, his political "uterus dress" at the Tony Awards, and the Egyptian-inspired masterpiece by The Blonds he wore to the Met Gala, we're well aware that when Porter arrives, expect a damn show.  The Pose star's latest fashionable appearance literally was, in fact, a show. Tipping a hat to his Broadway roots, the Tony winner performed at The Blonds' Spring 2020 runway extravaganza last night, which was a collaboration with the new stage adaptation of Moulin Rouge!. Aptly, Porter sang the musical's iconic "Lady Marmalade" with members of the cast to close the program. (Of course he hit all of Christina Aguilera's high notes. Is that even a question?)   The ‚ÄúLady Marmalade‚Äù moment from tonight‚Äôs @TheBlondsNY finale at @MoulinRougeBway, with Billy Porter and cast members ‚Äî impossible to not get your gitchi gitchi ya ya da da on while watching this ... #NYFW pic.twitter.com/X3JVJJCNUA  We're DONE with fashion month after witnessing @parishilton riding an Eiffel Tower and @theebillyporter belting "Lady Marmalade" last night! Who else could offer such theatrics besides @theblondsny , the famed designers behind some of music's biggest stars. For SS20, they joined forces with¬†@moulinrougebway and put on the most epic celebration of fashion, music, and theater. There were voguers, incredible sets, new songs added to the mix, and dozens of models rocking glitzy creations inspired by @bazluhrmann 's original film. TBH there's too much to recap here, so we made our first IGTV video and highly recommend you to watch all of it lol.

"It‚Äôs all so full circle and fabulous," Porter later reflected on Instagram.  The Blonds' latest offering was full of corsets, bustiers, and rich, red and black lace‚Äîas if they were pulled straight out of Baz Luhrmann's universe. Porter wore a standout white ensemble‚Äîwhich he described as "biker bride"‚Äîconsisting of a crystal-covered catsuit, matching boots, a floor-length coat, and a towering headpiece.  Porter's wasn't the only celebrity to cameo at The Blonds' show last night. Paris Hilton also had a full showgirl moment onstage, arriving on an Eiffel Tower prop in a shimmery silver ensemble with a group of male dancers.   This is how you make an entrance...‚ú®üë∏üèºüóº‚ú® A post shared by  Paris Hilton (@parishilton) on Sep 9, 2019 at 11:40pm PDT We'll next see Porter at the Emmy Awards (he's nominated for Lead Actor) on Sunday, September 22. Whether or not he leaves with a trophy, he's slated to win the red carpet no matter what. 
 The Fashion Spot's seasonal diversity report takes a closer look at the show castings.  The numbers are in and unsurprisingly, New York Fashion Week still has a long way to go when it comes to diversity.  With its seasonal runway report, The Fashion Spot assessed 82 major shows during New York Fashion Week's Fall 2018 collections for representation amongst race, size, and age. While racial diversity saw a slight improvement and transgender castings increased, there was a decrease in the already-low number of plus-size models to walk the runways. In other words, there's still a lot of work to be done‚Äîand the industry's progress is moving at a glacial pace.  Last season's Spring 2018 shows were the most racially diverse in NYFW history, with models of color accounting for 36.9% of the runways, but this season only saw a 0.4% increase in nonwhite models. It should be noted that the Fall 2018 season included significantly less shows and presentations in New York, with more designers heading to Paris or opting out completely. For instance, brands like Tome, Tracy Reese, and Helmut Lang typically cast inclusive and diverse shows, but they did not show this season. The Fall 2018 season's runways were 62.7% white and 37.3% models of color.  Though the industry is making small strides for racial diversity, body diversity is still lagging far behind. For Fall 2018, 26 plus-size models walked in only eight New York shows‚Äîaccounting for just 1.1% of total model castings.  Leading the way, once again, was Christian Siriano, who cast 10 plus-size models in his 10th anniversary show. Also notably celebrating all sizes on the runway was Chromat, who cast 9 plus-size models. Meanwhile, several designers, including Michael Kors and Prabal Gurung, cast only one plus-size model in their show: Ashley Graham.  While Graham has been a beacon for body positivity in the fashion industry, it should be noted that there are plenty of other plus-size models who also deserve spots in top shows‚Äîand one token Ashley Graham casting does not suddenly make your brand inclusive or body positive.  In terms of improvements, trans visibility made the most progress this season. Thirty-three transgender women and non-binary models walked in 23 shows‚Äîan increase from Spring 2018's 31 trans models.  Teddy Quinlivan, a model who came out as transgender last September, led the pack with nine major castings in shows like Carolina Herrera, Oscar de la Renta, and Alexander Wang. Marc Jacobs, meanwhile, cast four transgender models: Hunter Schafer, Massima Lei, Ariel Murtagh, and Dara Allen. Since Fall 2017, the number of transgender castings has more than doubled, from 12 castings to 33.  In a time of championing female empowerment and equality, it's perplexing that the fashion industry is still so far behind in celebrating women of all sizes, races, and ethnicities. Though many brands may be inching closer to more diversity on the runway, it's clear that there's still a long way to go‚Äîand there's no excuse for such slow progress anymore.  Read the full diversity report for New York Fashion Week Fall 2018 at The Fashion Spot. 
 The trio will also appear in a short film for the brand.  For its latest fashion campaign, Fendi tapped not one, not two, but three generations of Kardashians.  Momager Kris Jenner, mogul Kim Kardashian West, and 5-year-old style icon North West star together in the 10th anniversary campaign for Fendi's Peekaboo handbag. WWD shared a first-look at the campaign titled #MeandMyPeekaboo, which features the trio frolicking in a field with their Fendi bags, as you and your family also probably do.    In addition to the imagery, Kris, Kim, and North will also star in a short film for the campaign. And really keeping it all in the family, the video will be set to the backdrop of Kanye West's "Love Lockdown." "The idea was to expand the concept of family, as it‚Äôs part of our history, and we wanted other families of women. In the case of the Kardashians, they are all three of them very strong women, with strong personalities. It‚Äôs an iconic family, who is known for its appearance, but we wanted to bring more of an intimate side to the table," Silvia Venturini Fendi, creative director of accessories and menswear, told WWD.   This will mark the second of Fendi's #MeandMyPeekaboo campaign series. The first, which was unveiled back in April, starred the brand's creative director of accessories and menswear, Silvia Venturini Fendi, and her daughters Delfina Delettrez and Leonetta Luciana Fendi. Kim teased the campaign (which is slated to drop in its entirety on July 11) on Twitter, writing "So major to be  in a campaign with my mom and daughter." Fendi Campaign coming soon! So major to be  in a campaign with my mom and daughter üíï #FendiFamily #MeAndMyPeekaboo At just 5 years old, this will mark North West's first fashion campaign. But given her sense of style, I'd say it's pretty long overdue, don't you think?  

 The controversy behind Kendall Jenner's comments about models who don't have the luxury of being selective about what shows they walk in isn't quite over. Plus-size model Ashley Graham was asked by Andy Cohen on Watch What Happens Live what she thought about Jenner's remarks about being able to cherry-pick the shows she walks in...and Graham's response was candid: "Well, lucky for her because I‚Äôve never been that so lucky. I mean, this tits and ass just had to fight through and break down barriers everyday." For reference: Graham walked her first Michael Kors show in February 2017 after the designer said one season before that it would be impossible for him to include plus-size models in his show. She has been advocating for more size inclusivity in the industry and on the runway for years. Jenner, on the other hand, walked her first Michael Kors show in fall 2015, just one year after she walked the Marc Jacobs fall 2014 show, her first major New York Fashion Week moment. Lucky indeed.

 A call for peace, flower power and women's rights.  Kicking off Paris Fashion Week with a bang, Dior turned back time half a century to stage a 1968 protest down its Fall 2018 runway.  Since her appointment as the first female artistic director at the French fashion house, Maria Grazia Chiuri has utilized Dior's runways and collections to empower women. Today's show was no different as she channeled the resistance culture amongst students of the 1960s to advocate for women's equality.  "Take a look back to a time a half-century ago when revolutionary thoughts and actions were placing the power and energy of youth center stage and influencing generations to come. For Autumn-Winter 2018-2019, Maria Grazia Chiuri tapped into this anniversary, reinventing and reimagining the legacy of those heady times," Dior wrote, sharing the inspiration behind its show on Instagram. The exterior of the show space, which was held at Mus√©e Rodin, was covered in a collage of protest signs reading things like Hillary Clinton's famous 1995 quote, "Women's Rights Are Human Rights." Inside, the runway set echoed the same sentiment and was wallpapered with a collage of protest signs, feminist slogans and fashion magazine cutouts all from 1968 (including a few vintage Harper's BAZAAR magazine cutouts too).   The @dior show space covered in tear sheets of fashion magazines from 1968 #PFW pic.twitter.com/H3idcZm9Ia  As for the collection, the pieces echoed the 1960s resistance just as effectively as the walls. The runway opened with a thick knit sweater reading "C'est Non Non Non et Non!" (which translates to "It's no no no and no!") while another sweater featured an oversized peace sign.  An array of '60s-inspired patchwork pieces hit the runway in the form of mini skirts, boots and dresses. But there was also a dose of flower power-infused dresses, a standout shag coat, paisley-like prints and colorful lensed sunglasses.  Every single look was topped off with a black newsboy cap.  Following a season where many designers at New York Fashion Week surprisingly opted not to delve into politics, Maria Grazia Chiuri went all-in to commence Paris Fashion Week, making her message for Dior's Fall 2018 show loud and clear.  While the designer first kicked off her journey at Dior with those "We Should All Be Feminist" slogan tees that took over the street style scene, she's proven that tapping into the feminist movement isn't just a one-season "trend" for the brand. And that's a good thing.   
 The songstress is the new face of the "Shine" collection. If there's one thing Ciara knows how to do, that's shine, whether she's performing on a big stage, or stepping onto a red carpet. So, it's no wonder that the five-time Grammy-nominated songstress was chosen by Pandora to represent their new Shine collection. Their first all 18K gold plated collection is comprised of honeycomb themed jewery, from chokers, to stackable rings, pendants and charms.  A woman as busy and successful as Ciara with two kids at home doesn't necessarily need to get involved in fashion campaigns‚Äîbut the songstress says she's always loved clothes and accessories since she was young. "As an artist, it's cool when you get to collaborate with brands like Pandora, because its another extension of my creativity. In this case, the brand is about inspiring us women to shine bright, and to be creative in how we express ourselves. I personally get excited about moments like this for that reason, it's also a part of growing. These partnerships are things I work hard for. The best part is when brands have deeper meaning, this is about celebrating us women, it's inspiring."  At 32-years-old, the singer fondly remembers trying to make sense of herself through style missteps and wins. "I was always trying to figure out fashion‚Äîeven if I got it wrong. Over the years I got more comfortable and confident with myself. But growing up as a tomboy, I wore everything baggy, like my dad's Nautica shorts‚Äî which wasn't always seen as cool. I was also trying to find my self-esteem in it all." Even by the time Ciara stepped onto the music scene in 2003, she stood apart from the pop princesses of the early 00's in her baggy jeans and cut off ribbed tank tops. So when did she finally feel like she was shining bright? Her grammy win in 2006 quickly came to mind. "That was a special moment because that was something I had really dreamt of and believed it would happen. It was an affirmation of believing in yourself. Also, after giving birth to my babies, I can't even describe how special that feels to become a mom‚ÄîI'm blessed to have two babies so I definitely feel like I'm shining now."  But even someone as famous as Ciara can admit that it's hard to shine every single day of your life. Luckily she counts her team and her family as the ones who are always shining their light on her, and she relies on affirmations. "I have a go-to line, that is, 'no one can close a door that God has opened for you. What's meant for you is going to be for you, and no one can take that from you. The only thing that can take it from you, is you.'  That's how I find my strength if I feel like my light is being dimmed."  Pandora choker, $200, pandora.net SHOP
 Princess Diana's niece was overwhelmed. Lady Kitty Spencer walked the runway at Dolce & Gabbana's Alta Moda show last week, and it's clear that the model found the experience extremely emotional. Taking place on Lake Como in Italy, the jaw-dropping show featured Naomi Campbell in a flawless gown, Ashley Graham owning the runway, and some stunning choreography. Also walking the runway for the designer was Princess Diana's niece, Lady Kitty Spencer, who has fast become a Dolce & Gabbana favorite. Spencer was obviously overwhelmed by the decadent affair, and she shared a behind-the-scenes video of herself being fitted ahead of the show, and she couldn't contain the emotion. With tears in her eyes, wearing the incredible gown she wore on the runway, the model's caption reads:  Happy tears & laughter! My Alta Moda fitting for @dolcegabbana üåπ I was so overwhelmed by the beauty of their creation and the honour of being ‚ÄòLucia‚Äô in their I Promessi Sposi-inspired show yesterday.

An assortment of royals walked in the "Secrets and Diamonds" show back in February 2018, including Lady Violet Manners, the oldest daughter of the Duke and Duchess of Rutland. 
 Once again, the designer turned the runway into a full-on party.  Alexander Wang knows how to turn his New York Fashion Week shows into full-on ragers‚Äîand tonight's Spring 2018 collection was no exception.  The designer brought the fashion set to Bushwick, Brooklyn tonight for #WANGFEST, a fashion show/music festival/full-on party. From models making an entrance via a tour bus to a lineup of music performances, and plenty of drinks, there was a lot to keep up with at Wang's Spring 2018 show. Here, follow along as we track all the things unfolding at Wang's BK show tonight: 1) The late night show was held outdoors. Wang ditched a traditional runway for the streets of Bushwick. And guests were given festival-style cloth wristbands upon arrival. 2) Models entered the runway via a #WANGFEST tour bus. According to Bella Hadid's Instagram Stories, some twerking took place on said bus.  3) Kaia Gerber opened the show. The 16-year-old just made her runway debut on Thursday at Calvin Klein, making tonight her second-ever catwalk.    The #WANGFEST bus. #WANGSS18 #NYFW A post shared by  alexanderwang (@alexanderwangny) on Sep 9, 2017 at 6:48pm PDT  4) Models wore New Year's Eve-inspired headbands. The headwear featured phrases like "WANGOVER," "PARTY ANIMAL," and "AFTER AFTER PARTY." Indicating, there may be a few after after parties tonight.    5) Kim Kardashian and Kris Jenner made the trek to Bushwick to attend the show. Kim Takes Brooklyn would have made an excellent KUWTK spinoff. The duo watched on from behind the barricades, snapping photos as Kendall Jenner walked the runway.  Kris Jenner and Kim Kardashian at the Alexander Wang show. üì∑ @thealexbadia #nyfw #ss18 #wwdeye A post shared by  WWD (@wwd) on Sep 9, 2017 at 8:18pm PDT 5) The after-party was held at a Brooklyn warehouse on the street where the runway was staged. Included in the #WANGFEST party this year? Donut towers, an ice bar, cocktail juice pouches, an inflatable pool filled with bottles of Budweiser, and much more. Attractions also included a bounce house and NARS makeup booth outdoors, and a full-out concert stage inside the warehouse.  6) The night was filled with four musical performances. To further solidify Wang's music festival theme, there was a full artist lineup for the night. According to fliers posted around the venue, performances and DJ sets were scheduled to go through 3 AM. The mystery music acts turned out to be A$AP Ferg, Vince Staples, Cardi B, and Ja Rule and Ashanti. Watch this space for more updates...

 NY-based Apparis is the brand to watch.  NY-based Apparis has quickly become the faux fur darling of the fashion industry with editors, influencers and celebs alike shopping the brand‚Äôs luxe collection of outerwear. We talked to co-founders Am√©lie Brick and Lauren Nouchi about inspirations, the exclusive ShopBAZAAR Hero, and what‚Äôs next. Describe the beginnings of the brand.We started as a boutique selling French fashions, boots, handbags, etc. and we noticed that girls would come in and try on our faux fur coats that we had designed, and we realized that we had something special. Since the beginning, we were only selling vegan products and we wanted to continue down that route as we moved on in designing our line. We also wanted to keep our price point easily accessible to everyone while still providing a luxury element, because nothing is better than feeling like a million bucks without all the wallet pain.  In the beginning we basically did everything ourselves, from packing boxes, taking all our own photos, designing, marketing; we never took any backers because we wanted our product to be our own, and a statement of what we believe in. It was a lot of work, but also a ton of fun! What is a signature Apparis design feature?The softness of the faux fur! It took us years to develop the super soft and plush material. We kept going back to the factory to try out new techniques until we finally found the right one. The colors are also a big part of the Apparis feel. We love to play around with colors and aren‚Äôt afraid to step out of the comfort zone of browns and blacks.  In true Parisian style, we think less is more. Having that one statement piece, something that shows your personality, goes a long way. What makes the exclusive ShopBAZAAR  Hero so special?Unlike the other coats in our collection which are inspired by the colors of our home town of Marseille, we were inspired by our new home of New York. We are constantly bombarded by the uniform of navy suits that men wear, and we thought that the city girl should have their own uniform. A furry piece of armor to face the day, along with her cup of coffee.  Tell us about the craftsmanship behind the line.We take great pride in the quality of our faux furs. All of the fabrics are sourced in Paris, washed in a special solution, and triple rinsed to create the softness that you feel when you try on one of our pieces. We then have the coats manufactured in a boutique factory in China that we work closely with to produce all of our pieces.  Since we can‚Äôt use machines for most of the manufacturing process, most of the work is done by hand, and our Creative Director spends several weeks at the factories making sure that the level of craftsmanship is up to our standards.  5 words that describe the Apparis customer?Chic, Bold, Vibrant, Playful, Effortless.  Style tips you want to share?In true Parisian style, we think less is more. Having that one statement piece, something that shows your personality, goes a long way. This could be a bold red coat, a patterned bag, or some killer shoes. We aspire for the effortless chic look. Favorite style icons?Some of the fashion icons that we draw the most inspiration from are Brigitte Bardot and Carine Roitfeld. For us, they‚Äôre representative of bold, empowered women, and that‚Äôs exactly how we view Apparis. They are so chic, sexy, and feminine, and that‚Äôs how we want our clients to feel when they wear our coats.  How do you see your brand growing?We think in one way we want to remain true to our original concept, which is being a vegan brand with a Parisian flare. We want to stay true to our roots while still becoming the number one brand in the US and abroad. We recently did a capsule collection featuring children's coats with Moda Operandi, Mommy & Me, and it inspired us to want to expand into creating a more extensive children‚Äôs collection and possibly move into men‚Äôs. Powerful words of wisdom you received?I (Am√©lie Brick) remember this quote from Margaret Thatcher, ‚ÄúIf you want something said, ask a man; if you want something done, ask a woman.‚Äù And nothing has been more motivating. Our team here in New York are some of the most hard working women we‚Äôve ever met and we are constantly inspired by one another, we even name our coats after them. Sneak peek into future Apparis collections?We will be releasing our Resort Collection soon, which leans towards a more feminine color palette of light pinks, whites, and browns. The piece we are most excited about is the Lola, which is an ombre long hair faux fur.  SHOP NOW

 Watch the supermodels strut for the camera and relax behind the scenes. There are fashion campaigns, and then there are Calvin Klein fashion campaigns. Today, the brand launched its fall 2019 underwear campaign, duly titled #MYCALVINS IRL, showcasing a medley of the world‚Äôs biggest stars sporting its newest undergarments. Appealing to current culture‚Äôs collective craving for authenticity in the fashion industry, the brand writes that #MYCALVINS ‚Äúcelebrates two totally different perspectives of what sexy looks like. The result blurs the line between the public image and private realities of our unapologetic cast and asks the question, how do you do sexy? Perfectly filtered or IRL raw?‚Äù This question drives the campaign‚Äôs visual element, in which photos of its star-studded cast in supermodel sublimity are juxtaposed next to images in more candid and intimate settings (Bella Hadid, for example, rests her head against her shoulder in one photo then angstily scrunches her hair up while scrutinizing her form in a mirror in another). Yet, it is the campaign video that best exemplifies the ostensible dichotomy between being ‚Äúperfectly filtered‚Äù and ‚ÄúIRL raw.‚Äù Naomi Campbell lounges on a couch. Diplo poses for a web camera. Bella Hadid stares into a door‚Äôs peephole. Jacob Elordi takes mirror selfies. These are the scenes‚Äîflushed with color and believable mirth‚Äîthat flash in between black-and-white footage of the cast clinically posing for a crew of cameras against a white backdrop.  ‚ÄúEach comfortable in their own skin,‚Äù the brand notes of the campaign‚Äôs cast, ‚Äúand each confident in their Calvins.‚Äù #MYCALVINS IRL doesn‚Äôt necessarily seem to ask whether or not you feel sexier with or without filters, as much as it seems to answer its own question with, ‚ÄúWhy not both?‚Äù

 15 highlights to know from the Spring 2019 shows.  Another New York Fashion Week has come and gone and this season delivered an especially eclectic mix of fashion moments to unpack. From the return of Rodarte, Proenza Schouler, and Opening Ceremony to political statements on the runway to Rihanna giving us a grand finale for the books, the Spring 2019 collections had a little bit of everything. Catch up on all the major highlights‚Äîin no particular order‚Äîfrom this season of shows in New York.  Following a two-year hiatus in Paris, Rodarte returned to New York Fashion Week with a stunning show held in a rainy graveyard on the Lower East Side (umbrellas and all). For a brand known for its ethereal, yet moody aesthetic, the dark and drizzly moment couldn't have been a more perfect backdrop for a collection of ultra-feminine tulle, floral headpieces, and romantic gowns. The Mulleavy sisters know how to make a grand comeback. Serving as one of the most important runways of the week, Pyer Moss brought the fashion crowd to Weeksville, Brooklyn for a show that celebrated black culture to the fullest. The show's location, home to one of the nation's first free black communities after slavery, served as a powerful setting for a collection that utilized works by black artist Derrick Adams and made statements like "Stop Calling 911 On The Culture" in t-shirt form. Making the moment even more beautiful, a gospel choir performed as a cast of all-black models walked the runway. For his 50-year anniversary, Ralph Lauren pulled out all the stops with an over-the-top, celebrity-filled runway show held at the beautiful Bethesda Fountain in Central Park. Kanye West, Oprah, Hillary Clinton, Blake Lively, and a long list of stars celebrated the designer's milestone show that featured an astounding 100+ runway looks. Including both the Ralph Lauren Collection line and Polo Ralph Lauren looks, it was an ode to the designer's incredible impact on American sportswear.  Following her performance at this year's #BAZAARICONS party, Xtina went on to becoming the most surprising fixture at the Spring 2019 shows. From a front row appearances at Christian Cowan to a performance during Opening Ceremony's runway show (more on that later), the singer was everywhere this week. Always one to put on a fun and diverse runway show, this season was no exception for Christian Siriano. Though the designer had a star-studded front row featuring Whoopi Goldberg, Tiffany Haddish, Sarah Hyland, Judith Light, and Danielle Brooks, it was Cynthia Nixon who stole the show. Speaking ahead of New York's primary election on Thursday, Siriano placed reminders on all seats to vote Cynthia Nixon for Democratic governor. Nixon herself sat front row and watched as a "Vote for Cynthia" tee walked the runway. For a designer that advocates for inclusion, diversity, and women's rights, Nixon picked a fitting place to make a cameo during NYFW‚Äîthough she sadly didn't go on to win Thursday's primary.  After a stint in Paris, Proenza Schouler made a return to the NYFW schedule and along with it, brought some of your favorite supermodels from the late '90s and early 2000s. Amber Valetta, Karen Elson, Tasha Tilberg, and Gemma Ward all walked the runway‚Äî marked by its acid wash denim, reimagined suiting separates, and everyday wardrobe essentials. Brandon Maxwell brought the fashion crowd down South with a tailgate-inspired show that embraced his Texan roots. Showgoers sat in the back of pickup trucks and on Yeti coolers as a preppy, southern-inspired collection hit the runway, stomping down the catwalk to the sounds of country mainstays like Bonnie Rait. The piece de resistance, though, was the ros√©-bottle filled box bags that we now all want for spring.  Skipping a traditional runway show, Kenzo debuted its latest collection in the form of a short film. Written and directed by Humberto Leon, The Everything made its debut at a sparkling watch party held Friday night. The film, which showcases the brand's Fall 2018 collection, starred Milla Jovovich and a cast of cool teens that unsurprisingly made the collection look just as cool. You can watch the full thing here.  A diverse celebration of color and culture, Prabal Gurung's Spring 2019 runway represented models from an astounding 40 countries. From India to China to the designer's homeland of Nepal, a mashup of cultures and countries were celebrated as one collection of humanity and color inspired by the designer's travels around the world. It was a beautiful and diverse runway moment that sent a strong message of hope in today's political climate. Celebrity offspring and the modeling world go hand-in-hand, but this season we were in for a real surprise when Madonna's eldest daughter walked her first fashion show. At 21 years old, Lourdes Leon made her big runway debut at Gyspy Sport's Spring 2019 show, wearing a seashell body chain bra and baggy ripped jeans. She may just be the next style star to watch. Collaborating with Ru Paul's Drag Race, Opening Ceremony presented its Spring 2019 collection in the form of a live drag show hosted by Sasha Valour. Starring over 40 drag queens and LGBTQ models, the show celebrated the oft marginalized drag community in a fun, yet inspiring way. Topping it all off, the show ended with a surprise performance by Christina Aguilera.  For his first collection as creative director at Carolina Herrera, Wes Gordon brought on the color with a playful, yet elegant range of looks. Though he managed to stay true to the sophisticated and ladylike core of the brand, Gordon introduced a new wave of youth and romanticism to the fashion house that will have a fresh crop of Herrera girls coming through.  Marc Jacobs brought the drama this season‚Äîand not just in the form of his stunning spring collection. The designer's show started a whole 90 minutes late, ruffling the feathers of many fashion insiders‚Äîand stirring up a lot of rumors. The drama-filled wait, which Jacobs later sincerely apologized for on Instagram, was worth it though when an incredible collection of color, ruffles, and feathers hit the runway. It was Fashion with a capital F. The week came to a close with the ultimate grand finale: Rihanna's Savage x Fenty lingerie show. It was an incredibly diverse and stunning celebration of womanhood in every way‚Äîfeaturing symbolic dances, a theatrical performance, and an inclusive runway cast that also starred two pregnant models. To sum it up: Rihanna won the whole week.  Though you likely already heard, the #BAZAARICONS party got a little wild this year. Tapping into our September issue's rock'n'roll theme, partygoers including Tiffany Haddish, 21 Savage, Elsa Hosk, Karolina Kurkova, Karrueche Tran, Halima Aden, and more got into the spirit by wrecking a suite in true rockstar fashion‚Äîall in good fun, of course. 
 Bella Hadid, Alessandra Ambrosio, Karlie Kloss and more share how they got there. Although the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show doesn't air for another week and a half, the Angels and models are already flying overseas and getting settled in Shanghai before they take the runway to film on Monday. For last year's show in Paris, the models all flew together in a private jet complete with matching shirts and in-flight champagne. This year, the runway stars flew separately‚Äîsome in pairs or small groups‚Äîbut they still documented every step of their journey, from the moment they packed their luggage until after landing in China. Alanna Arrington had plenty of shoes to choose from. Jourdana Phillips had to shut her bag tight. Vanessa Moody had plenty of VS goodies.  Karlie Kloss showed her excitement on her Instagram Story. Grace Bol wore the coolest hat while waiting for her flight.  Martha Hunt and Elsa Hosk got a few photos before heading to the airport. Romee Strijd looked cozy in her pink fur. She and Jasmine Tookes flaunted their baggage. Georgia Fowler prepped with some tunes.  Herieth Paul was red hot for her trip. Devon Windsor proved color-blocking is great for airport style. Sui He bundled up before takeoff.  Kelly Gale, Georgia Fowler, and Devon Windsor took a few shots in front of the plane. Cindy Bruna's all-black attire matched her sleek luggage. Taylor Hill proved she was ready to go. VS Angel Alessandra Ambrosio brought her daughter Anja Louise along. Candice Swanepoel propped her feet up. Barbara Fialho flaunted her VS merch midair.  Josephine Skriver was all smiles in her seat. Lais Ribeiro looked chill as ever.  Victoria Lee showed off her "Angel" sweater. And so did Grace Elizabeth. Daniela Braga proved that slaying does not stop in an airplane. Bruna L√≠rio cozied up with a glass. Gizele Oliveira blew some kisses from the flight. Megan Williams sported a pink "Love" sweater. Bella Hadid showed off her enviable welcome gifts. Amilna Estevao, Bruna L√≠rio and Gizele Oliveira had a pajama party in their hotel. Barbara Fialho snuggled with a stuffed toy. Lameka Fox showed her love for VS. Gizele Oliveira wore the cutest PJs.  Alexina Graham made a new friend. The VS Fashion Show airs on CBS on November 28. 
 The model continues to break industry barriers.  Continuing to break barriers in the fashion industry, Andreja Pejjic just became the first transgender model to sign with Ford Models. The 26-year-old, who initially gained traction as fashion's first completely androgynous model, announced the monumental news on Instagram.  "I am more than delighted to announce that I will be joining forces with the legendary @fordmodels agency. @chrimichael is the kind of agent any girl in showbiz would die to have. I'm grateful that I can say I'm surrounded by a team that truly values what I bring to the table," Pejic wrote.  After publicly coming out as transgender back in 2013, Pejic was dropped from her modeling agency at the time. Now, she's signed on with one of the oldest and most prestigious modeling agencies in the world. In an interview with Forbes, Pejic opened up about the experience, "It feels good to go from not even knowing if I would have a future in the modeling business to joining forces with one of the biggest names in the industry, and following in the footstep of Christie Brinkley, Jerry Hall, Alek Wek‚Äîthe list goes on and on."  Pejic was the first to model both menswear and womenswear in the industry and became the first transgender model to land a major beauty campaign back in 2015 for Make Up For Ever. Along with walking the runways at Marc Jacobs, Jean Paul Gaultier, John Galliano and more, the model also became the first transgender woman to appear on the cover of GQ.  Now signed as an official Ford Model, it looks like this is only the beginning of Pejic's work as a force for transgender representation in the fashion and beauty realms. 
 Freida Pinto, Nyasha Matonhoze, and Margot are just a few of the inspiring women in the empowering photo series.  What constitutes an "It girl?" In the past, the term was strictly reserved for top models, socialites, and celebrities. But in the era of #MeToo, British designer Catherine Quin is looking to transcend the definition. This week, Quin launched 'Women of Purpose,'  a different kind of fashion campaign starring a lineup of inspiring women who've excelled in their professional and philanthropic endeavors. Forgoing a traditional model casting, the photo series features women from an array of backgrounds including actress/activist Freida Pinto, women's rights activist Brita Fernandez Schmidt, playwright Polly Stenham, musician Margot, artist Martynka Wawrzyniak, film maker Liza Voloshin, jewelry designers Phoebe and Annette Stephens, and more. ‚ÄúIn an age where celebrity lifestyles too often eclipse contribution and achievement, my goal is to celebrate women who live their lives with intention, determination and grace." Quin said of the Women of Purpose project. "With this initiative, I wanted to inspire women and offer talented and purposeful role models."  Coinciding with the photo series, Quin is also launching the Women of Purpose collection, which will donate 25 percent of all proceeds to Women for Women International, a non-profit organization that helps women of marginalized communities around the world rebuild their lives. All of the women featured in the campaign were photographed in pieces from the collection.  "It was important that we make a tangible contribution to help empower women on a global level. Partnering with the Women for Women charity and donating to their sister program has great synergy with our own initiative and our values as a brand," Quin told BAZAAR.com.  SHOP THE WOMEN OF PURPOSE COLLECTION NOW As an increasing number of brands look for new ways to join the conversation around female empowerment, Quin's Women of Purpose project serves as an actionable way to genuinely support women's rights‚Äîit's a reminder for more fashion brands to herald everyday women making a difference, not just the same It girl models over and over again.

 And we need to visit ASAP.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. An Yves Saint Laurent museum has opened up in Paris, featuring the brand's most iconic looks and the eponymous couturier's official design studio. The launch takes place nearly three weeks after the death of YSL co-founder Pierre Berg√©, who passed away on September 8 at the age of 68. He was dedicated to finding a permanent home for Saint Laurent's archives. 
 Meet "For All." Since its 2013 launch, Off-White has amassed a cult-like following with its effortlessly cool streetwear, cheeky logos, and A-list following. For those not willing to shell out $300 - $800 for a hoodie, however, the Virgil Abloh-helmed brand is launching a lower-priced capsule collection that's a bit more budget-friendly. Aptly called "For All," the new range targeted to millennial shoppers includes graphic t-shirts and hoodies at a more affordable price point. The unisex pieces range from $95 for a tee to $170 for a sweatshirt, making the streetwear-infused staples a little more accessible than Off-White's standard collection.  SHOP OFF-WHITE PIECES "The price tier allows for a new customer to see themselves within the overall concept of the fashion label. Off-White can be luxury at a traditional luxury price point, or equally it can be relevant at an affordable price point," Abloh said in a statement.  For All may be the first of Off-White's foray into more affordable pieces in the future. According to Business of Fashion, Abloh said, "I plan to [launch affordable collections] periodically but with the freedom to decide where and when in each instance." The brand's latest venture comes after a year filled with several new projects helmed by its founder and creative director including collaborations with Nike, Warby Parker, and an upcoming collection with Ikea.   Off-White‚Ñ¢ c/o @Nike ‚ÄúZoom Fly‚Äù A post shared by  Off-White‚Ñ¢ (@off____white) on Jan 6, 2018 at 10:12am PST The For All collection will be available to shop in Off-White stores only starting today. The brand has locations in New York, Paris, Toronto, London, Hong Kong, and more. 
 From Naomi to Gisele to Gigi, take a look back at how some of your favorite top models got their starts.  By now, you're probably used to seeing all your favorite supermodels on the runways and in the season's hottest campaigns, but you probably don't know how they each first got their start. From the most iconic supermodels of the '90s to today's runway stars, we're taking a look back at the model discovery stories that launched some of fashion's greatest careers.  Before Crawford graced the runway and the covers of all major fashion magazines, she was a girl living in the small town of DeKalb, Illinois. She recounted how a poolside photo that a local photographer took of her piqued her interest in modeling. From there, she traveled to Chicago and signed with the modeling agency Elite. Forbes's longtime highest-paid model in the world was discovered while shopping in S√£o Paolo, Brazil, The Independent reported. After walking her first runway at the age of 14, B√ºndchen went on to become the breakout supermodel of the late '90s and early 2000s, after making her big break at Alexander McQueen's spring 1998 show.  She has since dabbled in acting, appearing in movies like The Devil Wears Prada and Taxi, and most recently wrote a memoir, Lessons: My Path to a Meaningful Life. The iconic supermodel was only 15 when she was spotted by Pennington Models scout Beth Boldt. "A woman came up to me and asked if I'd ever thought of modelling. It was Beth Boldt, head of the Synchro agency. My immediate reaction was surprise and excitement," Campbell told The Guardian. "My mum wanted me to stay on at school and finish my exams. But I wanted things my way, so a few weeks later I went to see Beth on my own. On my first visit, she parted my hair in the middle, did my makeup and took me up on the roof in my school uniform to take a few black-and-white pictures. Eventually, Mum decided I could model, so long as it didn't interfere with my school work or exams."  In January 1990, Campbell  was declared "the reigning megamodel of them all" by Interview. Most famously, she was also part of The Big Five supermodels of the '90s‚Äîgoing on to become a runway icon and the face of endless major fashion campaigns. Renowned model scout Sarah Doukas found a 14-year-old Moss squabbling with her father at JFK Airport in New York. Doukas got on their flight to England and approached them in-flight as soon as the seat belt sign turned off, Business Insider reported.  In the '90s, Moss's collaborations with Calvin Klein brought her to fashion icon status after debuting the "heroin chic" look. Moss spent the decade dominating runways, campaigns, and editorials as one of the supermodels to watch.  Passing the torch along, Moss founded the Kate Moss Agency in 2016 for young models and creatives.  While horseback riding in Florida at the age of 14, Turlington was spotted by a photographer. Just one year later, she was making her way to Paris, she revealed in an interview with Harper's BAZAAR.  While dominating the '90s fashion world as one of The Big Five supermodels, she appeared in major campaigns for Calvin Klein, Chanel, Versace, and more while also walking every major runway show. In 2014, she was named one of TIME's 100 Most Influential for the philanthropic work she has accomplished since.  "I took a modeling course in my hometown, St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada. It was sort of a scam. In order to work as a model, you had to pay for the classes. My mom paid for me. They sent me there at 16, and I was chosen by a Japanese agency to go over to Japan for the summer to work,"  Evangelista told Interview in 2013.  "My parents were strict Italians who didn't let me go out past 10 o'clock, and I had to choose between going out Friday or Saturday night and was not allowed to have a boyfriend. But they said okay. I got there and it was a catastrophe. They wanted me to take my clothes off and shoot me naked. It was a nightmare and I panicked and basically the Canadian Embassy helped me out. I was there about two days and went home, saying, 'I don't want anything to do with this ever again.' But how I got my start was that my modeling agency insisted I enter the Miss Teen Niagara Pageant." Now, Evangelista is respected as one of the most iconic, influential models of all time and has appeared on more than 700 magazine covers. Gigi inherited her modeling chops from her mom, Yolanda Hadid, and started her career when she was only two years old. She was first discovered by Guess cofounder Paul Marciano as a toddler and appeared in a Baby Guess campaign. As a teenager, she relaunched her modeling career and signed with IMG in 2013.  After landing her first major fashion editorial in the December 2014 issue of Harper's BAZAAR, Gigi's modeling career skyrocketed both on and off the runway. She has since walked just about every major fashion show, starred in a multitude of campaigns, and collaborated with Tommy Hilfiger for three seasons on the Tommy x Gigi brand.  Harlow was first discovered by Tyra Banks on Instagram, who cast her as a contestant on America's Next Top Model. Harlow placed sixth overall in the competition, after winning a second chance following her original elimination.  Since then, Harlow has walked runways for the likes of Marc Jacobs, Tommy Hilfiger, and was just cast as Victoria's Secret's newest model. She has also been a spokesperson for vitiligo and gave a TED talk in 2014 called, "My Story Is Painted on My Body." Delevingne's close connections, including older socialite sister Poppy, helped launch her into the modeling world at a young age. "I've been best-friends with Genevieve Garner, daughter of Sarah Doukas [CEO of Storm Model Management] since I was five. Sarah saw me when she came to our school and Gen introduced us. I had never thought about modeling before, and it just happened," she told The Telegraph in 2011. Delevigne was signed to Storm Model Management in 2009 and landed her first campaign for Burberry at 18 years old.  Delevingne quickly went on to dominate the runways and won Model of the Year at the 2012 British Fashion Awards.  Christie Brinkley has her dog to thank for her modeling career. In an interview with WWD, Brinkley revealed that, while calling a veterinarian for her sick dog in Paris, she met a photographer at the telephoning office who saw her potential. He asked to shoot her for a project, and Brinkley has since graced photoshoot sets worldwide. Merci, pooch! Ambrosio started taking modeling classes in Brazil at the age of 12. She continued with the contests, and by the time she had turned 14, she was chosen as a finalist for the countrywide Elite Model Look competition. The rest, as they say, is history.  Along with appearing in major fashion campaigns for brands like Balmain and Dolce & Gabbana, the model has been most known for her work with Victoria's Secret. As one of the most recognized VS Angels, Ambrosio walked an astounding 17 Victoria's Secret Fashion Shows, making last year her final walk for the annual show.  Long before walking the biggest shows at fashion week, Kloss walked a charity fashion show in her Missouri hometown. Then, at the age of 15, she made her New York Fashion Week debut on Calvin Klein's runway. "I was discovered at 13 in a mall in St. Louis. I had never been on an airplane, actually." she told CBS in 2015. Since, Kloss has walked every major runway in New York, London, Milan, and Paris‚Äîalong with starring in campaigns for brands like Oscar de la Renta, Versace, and Diane von Furstenberg. In 2015, she partnered with Flatiron School and Code.org to create a scholarship program, Kode with Klossy, which supports young girls who are interested in computer science to become leaders in tech.  Instead of getting scouted by surprise, Smalls actively pursued modeling in Puerto Rico, where she was born and raised. Though she lost the competitions she entered as a young girl, she earned a much bigger prize later on. After moving to New York, Smalls signed to IMG Models in 2009 and focused on runway work. She got her big break walking at Givenchy Haute Couture in 2010, courtesy of Riccardo Tisci.  In 2010, Smalls began modeling for Victoria's Secret and has walked in the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show since. But aside from the VS runway, she's also walked just about every major fashion show including  Gucci, Chanel, Prada, Tom Ford, Versace, Balenciaga, Saint Laurent, and Louis Vuitton.  The model was first discovered by British agency Profile Model Management when she was just 15 years old and  signed to its New Faces division. Whiteley made her runway debut at Vivienne Tam's New York Fashion Week show in 2004. She has appeared on dozens of magazine covers; graced campaigns for Givenchy, Dolce & Gabbana, Burberry, and Balmain; and became a Victoria's Secret Angel in 2010.  EmRata's dream of acting and modeling came true when she signed with Ford Models at age 14. Between small modeling jobs, she dipped her toes into the acting world and once appeared on Nickelodeon show iCarly, according to The New York Times. She dropped out of college after one year to pursue her modeling career and got her big break in 2011 when she appeared naked in Robin Thicke's music video for "Blurred Lines." Today, Ratajkowski has appeared in hundreds of magazines and even landed key roles in movies such as Gone Girl, Entourage, and I Feel Pretty.  Cool girl Woods was actually discovered by another model, Ash Stymest.  "I was literally at a bus stop in L.A. and Ash Stymest runs up to me and he's like 'Oye!' and I'm like, 'What the f**k? Who is this?'" she told CR Fashion Book in 2016.  "So we got close and he ended up being one of my best friends for a minute. And then Dave [Mushegain] started taking pictures of me. And then I came to New York and The Lions signed me. I've been working with them for a couple months and then they finally signed me a week ago or something like that." Woods has appeared in campaigns for Moschino and Calvin Klein and was named one of the faces of Fenty Beauty by Rihanna in 2017. In fact, the model is a regular muse to Rihanna herself and most recently walked her Savage x Fenty runway show at New York Fashion Week while nine months pregnant.  According to an interview with The Guardian, Dunn was spotted "mucking about"‚Äînot shopping, she corrects‚Äîin a Primark store when she was 15. She was approached by an agent from Storm Management, the same agency responsible for discovering Kate Moss. By 16, she was already walking in shows for Ralph Lauren and Marc Jacobs. Dunn has appeared as the face of Maybelline and in 2013, she was named Model of the Year at Harper's BAZAAR UK's Women of the Year Awards.  Aldridge was at her school carnival when she was discovered at the age of 16, according to Tatler. Her first job was a campaign for Abercrombie & Fitch. Since then, Aldridge has appeared in campaigns for Rag & Bone, Bobbi Brown, Coach, and been named a Victoria's Secret Angel, walking in the brand's runway show each year. The sweet-faced model got her claim to fame when she won a modeling contest for Dolly magazine at the age of 13 years old. Afterward, she moved to Brisbane to finish school and started modeling for Billabong. In 2004, she signed with NEXT Model Management and eventually signed a contract with Maybelline, later becoming the first Australian Victoria's Secret Angel.   The South African bombshell was unexpectedly discovered while shopping at a flea market. By the time she was 16, she was already modeling in Paris, according to Business Insider.  Along with being named a Victoria's Secret Angel in 2010, Swanepoel has walked the runway for several major designers including Fendi, Dolce & Gabbana, Michael Kors, and Chanel. In 2018, she launched her own swimwear line, Tropic of C. Iman said she had wanted to be a model her whole life. After turning 13, she and her aunt visited various modeling agencies around her home city of L.A. In a matter of weeks, she found herself signing with Ford.  In 2010, Iman became a Victoria's Secret Angel and starred in several of the company's campaigns. She's also appeared in campaigns for Dolce & Gabbana, DKNY, Bottega Veneta, Ralph Lauren, and many more.  Teigen's popularity reached viral status after she posed for Sports Illustrated, but Teigen was first scouted at a surf shop she worked at in Huntington Beach, California. Even then, she was not convinced. "For someone as insecure as I was, it didn't seem possible," she once told Vegas magazine. In 2010, she was Sports Illustrated swimsuit Rookie of the Year and later appeared on the 50th anniversary cover. Now signed to IMG Models, she's also a New York Times best-selling cookbook authorand the host of Lip Sync Battle.  When Kroes was an 18-year-old living in Holland, she sent photos of herself to an agency to earn some extra cash and was signed immediately. "I felt super-young coming from the north of Holland, and I went to Amsterdam only once before I went to New York. It was a really big adventure to go there," she told The Telegraph. In 2008, Kroes become a Victoria's Secret Angel and has been a regular on the runway since. She's also landed campaigns for brands like Valentino, Balmain, Mugler, and Stuart Weitzman.  "I wasn't discovered as such, my mum called Premier Models after seeing The Model Agency on Channel 4 and Carole White, Premier's founder signed me up straight away!" she told i-D in 2014. That same year, she became the first black model in 19 years to score a Prada campaign‚Äîthe last one being Naomi Campbell.  Firth has walked in shows for Jean Paul Gaultier, Bottega Veneta, Marc Jacobs, and made her Victoria's Secret Fashion Show debut in 2013.  "I was in Cape Town on vacation with my grandmother and grandfather. We went to the grocery store after church and this guy came up to me and asked if I was a model and wrote his number on a piece of paper and my grandfather was like this is so shady," Prinsloo told Fashionista in 2009. "So we went home and told my parents about it and never did anything. And then the next time I was in Cape Town, Noelle [Doukas, daughter of Sarah Doukas, founder of Storm] came up to me and asked me to come into the agency. So I finally went in and signed with Sarah right there. I spent the summer in Cape Town and it went really well so they shipped me off to London." Prinsloo first debuted as a Prada/Miu Miu Exclusive. She became a Victoria's Secret Angel in 2009 and later designed the Behati Loves Pink swimsuit capsule collection for the brand. She has appeared in campaigns for H&M, Nina Ricci, DKNY, and Nine West.  "I was discovered at an Irish dance competition when I was 14. I was sitting with my friends and this older man came up to me and said, 'Have you ever thought of modeling?' I actually thought he was one of the security guards or someone who worked at this dance competition, and he was going to tell me to remove my feet from the fancy tables. All of us thought it was some kind of joke ‚Äî or that this man needed glasses," Rocha told BuzzFeed in 2013.  Since then, Rocha has faced a number of campaigns including Versace, Chanel, Dior, and Dolce & Gabbana.  Heatherton started modeling after an unexpected run-in at the beach. An Abercrombie & Fitch scout approached her‚Äînot really "approached" as much as "ambushed"‚Äîfrom his cab and asked who represented her. "Modeling is not a normal career path in Skokie. I was embarrassed that he hadn't asked my friend to model, too, but my friend's mom was there and got his information. Later that year, I was in New York meeting with agencies, and that's when I began with Marilyn," she told Michigan Avenue Magazine in 2011. Heatherton has since walked for Stella McCartney, Chanel, Tommy Hilfiger, Michael Kors, Christian Lacroix, and more. She began walking in the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show in 2008 and has become a featured face of the brand. In an essay published in Vogue, Iman recounts sitting for her first-ever shoot in Kenya with photographer Peter Beard.  Beard later took these photos back with him to New York, and his reputation as a fashion photographer gave Iman the credence and exposure  necessary to be catapulted into supermodel stardom. Although Banks is one of the most well-known supermodels in fashion today, it didn't start out as breezy as she can make it seem on the runway. She initially received rejections from different fashion agencies, some even saying that they "already have a black girl." Eventually, she signed on to Elite Model Management while she was still in high school. And the rest is history. Although Bella originally moved to New York City to study photography at Parsons School of Design, she ended up dropping out after one term when her modeling career began to skyrocket. She was signed on to IMG and made her New York Fashion Week debut in 2014.

 Does it get any more Paris Fashion Week than this? Saint Laurent set the bar high on Day 1 of Paris Fashion Week by staging a nighttime show underneath the Eiffel Tower.  The French monument sparkled as the ultimate backdrop just moments before the Spring 2018 collection made its way down the catwalk. In terms of a show venue, could it possibly get any more Parisian than this? Models emerged on the runway as a smoke machine created a dusky glow and the glistening Eiffel Tower lit up  the distance. As for the collection, it was a mix of dramatic pouf silhouettes, fringe boots, embellished pieces, and leather mixed with lace. Kaia Gerber made her Paris Fashion Week debut in one of the pouf dresses in a black patent finish.   With a backdrop like that, however, it was hard to focus just on the clothes. 
 The unlikely pair stars in Gap's new campaign together.  As part of its fall campaign, Gap brought two completely opposite music icons together for an unexpected duet. The All-American brand tapped the legendary Cher to appear alongside rapper Future in the "Meet Me In The Gap" denim campaign, which features the two singing a rendition of Sly and the Family Stone‚Äôs "Everyday People." The unexpected collaboration is the final installment of Gap's ongoing campaign bringing diverse and culturally dynamic talents together to create inspiring works of art. In the video, the 71-year-old trailblazer and the 33-year-old rapper meet in a blank studio space reminiscent to Drake's "Hotline Bling" set to sing a duet (which is mostly just Cher singing solo because, DUH).  Both Cher and Future wear different washes of Gap's classic denim in the video, but the female style icon epically brought her own signature look to the campaign and wore a bedazzled sequin bodysuit underneath her denim jacket. ‚ÄúI love the idea of ‚ÄòMeet Me in the Gap‚Äô because it‚Äôs easy to have common ground if you are really open and curious to people from different cultures,‚Äù Cher said in a statement released by the brand, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know who Future was before this but I knew it would be so fun to work with someone who is completely unlike me, and who is young, really talented and striving.‚Äù Topping off an already inspiring and uplifting project helmed by Gap, the song choice of the 1969 hit, "Everyday People," feels especially fitting for the duo to sing today with lyrics that touch upon racism, sexism and coming together as one.  ‚ÄúAs a brand, our heritage is rooted in being a beacon of hope and optimism while also bringing people together. Uniting two superstars like Cher and Future proves that no matter how different we seem, there is always a common thread that we just might not have discovered yet," Gap chief marketing officer Craig Brommers said on the campaign. 
 The fashion may be different, but their faces are identical. Kaia Gerber made her runway debut last night, further proving that she's following in her mom Cindy Crawford‚Äôs supermodel footsteps. The 16-year-old has often been described as the spitting image of her mother, but on her first catwalk yesterday, that was even more so‚Äîespecially when compared to Crawford‚Äôs own debut. Gerber walked for Calvin Klein on Thursday night in a two-tone oxford shirt, yellow pants, blue turtleneck, yellow pants, and boots‚Äîa part of Raf Simon's take on Americana style. Her debut came 26 years after Crawford's, which was at Donna Karan's Spring 1991 collection.  The models couldn't have been dressed any more differently (fashion can change a lot in two and a half decades); Crawford sported an edgy-feminine ensemble clad with denim and gold chains while her daughter donned a more androgynous, color-blocked outfit. But their faces? Nearly identical. Crawford was about 24 when she first walked for Donna Karan, but Gerber got to hit that milestone eight years earlier. The supermodel has openly expressed how she's mentored her daughter as she makes her mark in the modeling world, so she was unsurprisingly proud when Kaia walked her first runway. "Congrats @KaiaGerber! What a way to kick off your first runway season!! So excited for you!" she wrote to her daughter on Instagram.   Congrats @KaiaGerber! What a way to kick off your first runway season!! So excited for you! A post shared by  Cindy Crawford (@cindycrawford) on Sep 8, 2017 at 11:16am PDT
 "The fact that I‚Äôm seeing a mannequin that actually looks like me is amazing." When Rihanna debuted her first Fenty collection at a New York City pop-up on Tuesday, people not only took notice of the clothes, but also the mannequins wearing them. These in-store models weren't the svelte, 24-inch-waist figures displayed at regular retail stores. These mannequins had curves.  One photo from the event, posted by @TeamOfRihanna, made its rounds on Twitter after fans noticed the mannequin in the picture had hips, full breasts, and a little belly.  "Here for this mannequin having hip dips and a little pooch," user @Chaantellie tweeted. "Wow this mannequin is shaped like me," wrote another. Others responded with similar joyous reactions of feeling represented.   "Rihanna‚Äôs vision for FENTY is to celebrate femininity in all its form," the brand told BAZAAR.com in a statement. "This Release 6-19 explores another facet of a woman‚Äôs wardrobe, one that honors all colors, shapes, curves and styles. We wanted to illustrate the Maison‚Äôs inclusive side by showing a size-range of mannequins which represent this reality."

Release 6-19. @FentyOfficial pic.twitter.com/P6KMjtCwlR After Nike, Rihanna's #FENTY introducing curvy mannequin is surely a welcoming and world-changing idea! pic.twitter.com/0gNEXQKXEd Holy Shit! A mannequin with hip dips like me! First time I‚Äôve ever seen thisüòç fenty ruling the world https://t.co/yujhp1xqwD I was today years old when I seen my first mannequin with hip dips like me ! Thank you Fenty. https://t.co/Yztx9JEuHy The consistency of the FENTY brand in showcasing diversity is so admirable.The mannequin is black, curvy, and has a lil' under belly pouch too! I stan abeg. https://t.co/heiBf3nB5i okay pudge!!!!! come through hips!!!! the fact that i‚Äôm seeing a mannequin that actually looks like me is amazing. i always thought my body was wrong growing up bc i never saw an example that looked like me. thank you, Fenty. thank you, Rihanna. The body shapes of the mannequins varied in size; some seemed to have flatter stomachs, while some had thicker thighs. They might not have technically qualified as "plus size" figures, but with their familiar curves and dips, they resonated with real women. It's important to see as some high-fashion brands still struggle to embrace bigger sizes on the runway and in ads.  Inclusivity is a constant theme in Rihanna's brands. She launched Fenty Beauty with 40 shades of foundation, which especially benefitted people of color who've often had limited options of darker cosmetic shades to choose from. She included a plus-size collection in her Savage x Fenty lingerie line and featured models of various body sizes (including two pregnant women) in the runway show.     The size representation does not stop with her Fenty fashion line, which goes up to the French size 46 (size 14 in the U.S.). "We have our fit models, which is the standard size from factories, you just get your samples made in one size," Rihanna explained to E! News at the pop-up launch. "But then, I want to see it on my body, I want to see it on a curvy girl with thighs and a little bit of booty and hips." The singer-turned-designer, who's previously opened up about her "fluctuating body type," also credited her changing figure as something that guided her during the design process. "It's all of these things I take into consideration because I want women to feel confident in my stuff," she added.    Size diversity is just as impactful for consumers to see on mannequins as it is on runway models and actual clothes. Racked reported in 2017 that mannequins are the "strongest method of 'silent selling'" and one that "looks or is shaped like like the customer" is more likely to influence sales.  As The Guardian reported in 2015, the average mannequin has the following unrealistic measurements: six-foot height, 34-inch bust, 24-inch waist, and 34-inch hips. But the average American woman is about five foot three with a 38-inch waist, according to the CDC. Fenty isn't the only brand to embrace more realistic body types in its mannequins; J. C. Penny and David's Bridal have already done so, according to Racked, and Nordstrom and Target are adding shapelier mannequins to their stores, The Wall Street Journal reports. But with Fenty, a brand that stands alongside Dior, Givenchy, and Louis Vuitton in the LVMH conglomerate, Rihanna is bringing that change to a high-fashion space. 
 A crop of popular accounts are selling minimalism and a more sustainable approach to fashion influencing. We‚Äôve all heard the popular Insta tropes: blue performs better than red, more posts are better than less, adding balloons helps engagement. Since the dawn of the Valencia filter, these were the unwritten rules influencers lived by in their mission to procure those ever-elusive followers. In other words, don‚Äôt whisper your images, scream them‚Äîand hope someone hears. But fashion influencers are beholden to the capricious whims of fashion (one minute you‚Äôre in, the next minute you‚Äôre out). What if there‚Äôs been a shift? As the algorithm continues to perplex and frustrate, as likes become harder to get, and followers leave faster than new ones come onboard, what if now, less is actually more on the ‚Äògram? There is a rising crop of ‚Äúfashion influencers‚Äù skipping the blue, the red, and the balloons in favor of a neutral palette with gilded accents and an overall lack of color. It‚Äôs less about cupcakes or peonies, and more about Pierre Jeanneret chairs or a well-made cappuccino‚Äîand a growing community of Instagram‚Äôs more than 1 billion members are here for the makeunder. A post shared by D√©bora Rosa (@deborabrosa) on May 28, 2019 at 11:32am PDT It‚Äôs almost impossible to chart who started what trend on a platform like Instagram, but the O.G.s of what we‚Äôre calling the ‚ÄúBeige Movement‚Äù could be considered Pernille Teisbaek, Marie von Behrens of @MVB, Christie Tyler of @NYCBambi, and Debora Rosa, the tastemaker behind both her own namesake account and @fashiiongonerogue. There‚Äôs also Sylvie of @SylvieMus_, Tylynn Nguyen, Beatrice Gutu, Sophia Roe, and @oljaryz by Olja Ryzevski. They live in New York, Portugal, Copenhagen, Paris, and Berlin. Their feeds consist of selfies with dappled lighting, Franz Kline paintings, mid-century modern furniture, vintage cars, marble bathrooms, and buttery outfit posts. They garner inspiration from minimalism icons like the original Calvin Klein PR girl, the late Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy, post-NYU Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, and the original supermodels at their most pared back: Kate, Naomi, Christy. A post shared by Christie Tyler (@nycbambi) on Jun 2, 2019 at 8:25am PDT While Debora Rosa likes to stick to modern silhouettes in neutral, earthy tones for a timeless grid that she calls ‚Äúmasculine with a feminine twist,‚Äù Christie Tyler prefers a ‚Äúmelting pot of aesthetics‚Äù with vintage pieces sitting alongside her minimalist favorites.  ‚ÄúMy aesthetic is very neutral focused, as you might be able to tell,‚Äù says Tyler, ‚Äúbut I also love classic vintage pieces that will last in any wardrobe.‚Äù What they, and accounts like theirs, have in common are the flagship brands on heavy Instagram rotation, including #OldCeline (Phoebe Philo continues her reign from beyond retirement), new Bottega Veneta, The Row, Gabriela Hearst, Christopher Esber, Peter Do (formerly of #OldCeline), newcomer Khaite, influencer-founded brand Tot√™me, and The Frankie Shop. With 200,000 followers, Tyler, who recently graduated from university, has been slowly building her dedicated Instagram audience for five years. Her feed promotes ‚Äúa sustainable wardrobe‚Äù where vintage and resale are not only welcome but celebrated (notice the Old in Old C√©line). Because a good beige pant, a breezy white dress, and a great black sandal simply won‚Äôt go out of style.  ‚ÄúIf you look at my Instagram, you will notice the same pieces, just styled differently,‚Äù explains Tyler. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs real life and a real wardrobe, which I think is nice for my followers to see because they can use the same piece and style it in their own ways too.‚Äù At its core, this type of simplicity seems poorly suited for the social media channel most associated with a capitalist‚Äôs dream of consumption: a place where logos rule and a rainbow of colors (or at least millennial pink and a saturated filter) are king. For this minimalist approach, less is literally more.  A post shared by Sylvie Mus (@sylviemus_) on Feb 22, 2019 at 8:46am PST ‚ÄúPeople feel overwhelmed with so many new things on offer every day,‚Äù says Rosa. ‚Äú[My Instagram] is a way of avoiding over-consumption and mass production, a lifestyle of being comfortable with less clutter surrounding yourself and your life. With the fast pace of daily life, people want something timeless and chic that makes them feel comfortable and good about themselves every day.‚Äù She‚Äôs not wrong.  Americans on average buy more than five garments every month, and discard 70 pounds of garments every year, according to The Council for Textile Recycling. We are all suffering from shopping fatigue, and the message that these Instagram accounts are selling is a welcome antidote. It‚Äôs not simply that women should invest in timeless pieces. It‚Äôs that in 2019, with only 11 years to save the planet from irreversible damage, promoting an endless stream‚Äîor feed‚Äîof new, trendy, and often fast-fashion products is frankly pass√©. A post shared by Marie von Behrens (@mvb) on Jun 6, 2019 at 9:33am PDT These ‚Äúneutral‚Äù accounts appeal to the woman who will save up for The Row sandals in summer, a Max Mara coat in winter, a Bottega Veneta clutch, or an heirloom Chanel 5.5. It's luxury that lasts. And at the very least, these posts make a stronger case for the ever-growing resale market. And doesn‚Äôt that make for a pretty picture?

 The official new 9-to-5 pump is here.  Kicking off day one of New York Fashion Week, Tom Ford brought a much-needed dose of female empowerment to the runway.  The designer's Fall 2018 collection was filled with '80s-inspired looks including neon colors, an abundance of leopard print, oversized headbands, ultra-glam earrings and more. But what stood out most on the high-impact runway were the sparkling accessories donning the words "PUSSY POWER" in all caps.  Topping off an all-black look, it was impossible to ignore the statement-making, crystal-encrusted bag dangling from a model's arm‚Äîthe words "Pussy Power" bolded, capitalized and sparkling in crystals (as they always should be, of course).  The TOM FORD Women‚Äôs FW18 Show. #TOMFORD #TOMFORDFW18 #NYFW pic.twitter.com/vCAYNESIiW And because every modern-day working woman also needs the perfect pair of 9-to-5 pumps for the office, Tom Ford also designed a matching pair of sparkling "Pussy Power" heels. Done in the perfect shade of hot pink, the square-toed slingback heels make for the ultimate update on the '80s Working Girl pump.   The TOM FORD Women‚Äôs FW18 Show. #TOMFORD #TOMFORDFW18 #NYFW pic.twitter.com/OrG9QAmJIT  Perfect for making an entrance into your next board meeting, marching on Washington or angrily stomping in as you dial your senator, we could all use a pair of "Pussy Power" pumps in our life in 2018.  With six days left of Fall 2018 shows at New York Fashion Week, this is likely only the beginning of designers making feminist statements on the runway. Given our country's current political climate‚Äîcombined with the ongoing #TimesUp and #MeToo movements amongst women‚Äîit's safe to say we can only expect more moments of female empowerment through fashion this week. 
 "How could one not be astonished by such beauty?" At the stroke of midnight, Rihanna's highly-anticipated 2019 Savage X Fenty show finally premiered on Amazon Prime Video. In behind-the-scenes footage, the singer-turned-designer talks about "not trying to make history," but everything she did on that runway made history. Like last year's show, it was all about the celebration of women's bodies and sexuality in an inclusive and diverse environment. There were women of all sizes, races, ethnicities, trans women, disabled women.  ‚ÄúEvery woman deserves to feel sexy. We are sexy, we are multi-faceted and I want women to embrace that to the fullest," Rihanna explains in the intro to the Amazon special.  IT'S NOT JUST A FASHION SHOW BUT A WHOLE FESTIVAL OF WOMEN'S POWER, BODY ACCEPTANCE, POSITIVITY AND INCLUSIVITY AND A RIHANNA'S FRIGGIN SAVAGE FENTY SHOW!!!#SavageXFentyShow pic.twitter.com/2TtklvxrPq Unlike any lingerie show or ad of the past, Rihanna's Savage X Fenty is shown through the female lens. It wasn't about catering to what men want, it was about women defining and taking control of their own sexiness‚Äîon their own terms. And as millions of women watched the show, they were noticeably moved by the fact.   I‚Äôm watching the  #SAVAGEXFENTYSHOW and getting bossebumps !! Women come in all shapes, shades and we‚Äôre ALL sexy!! Rihanna is so fucking inspirational !! üôåüèΩüôåüèΩüôåüèΩüôåüèΩüôåüèΩüôåüèΩüôåüèΩ Her creativity, work ethic and inclusion is UNMATCHED !   me after watching the #SAVAGEXFENTYSHOW realizing Rihanna literally broke the fashion industry ‚Äústandards‚Äù by having models of all orientation, color, size, and beauty, out of this world performances, and having a runway show that‚Äôll be remembered for a long time.

On Twitter, people were quick to notice the difference her diverse runway casting made them feel while watching the show:   @rihanna had women of all shapes, sizes and complexions in this and not only that, AT THE FOREFRONT doing bad gal moves. She didn‚Äôt bring them just to hide them in the back. Ms Fenty should be so proud of herself. ‚ù§Ô∏è #SAVAGEXFENTYSHOW   I‚Äôve never, ever, in 39 years, watched a fashion show.

 The magical Spring 2019 show took place in the midst of a rainstorm. A little rain couldn't hinder Rodarte's highly anticipated return to New York Fashion Week. After a few seasons of showing in Paris, designers Kate and Laura Mulleavy brought their Spring 2019 collection back to New York for a magical outdoor show on the Lower East Side last night‚Äîin the midst of a rainstorm, no less.  Models were escorted to the runway, which was held in the middle of New York's Marble Cemetery, under large umbrellas (also used to shield those attending the show). For a brand known for its ethereal, yet moody aesthetic, the dark and drizzly moment couldn't have been more perfect for a collection filled with ultra-feminine tulle, floral headpieces, and stunning gowns.    Despite the rain showers, Rodarte's romantic, drama-filled gowns came to life on the outdoor runway of graves‚Äîa giant metaphor in itself. For spring, the Mulleavys looked to fairytale-worthy dresses done in a range of hues from reds to pinks, blues, and even striking shades of fuchsia and violet.  It was a reminder of the dreaminess that had been missing from the New York Fashion Week calendar since Rodarte left the schedule two years ago.    Amplifying the romanticism of it all, the gowns were accessorized with sculptural floral headpieces and Art Deco-inspired metal stars. The makeup looks, featuring bright and bold eye shadows and blush inspired by Picasso paintings, were the icing on the cake of an already breathtaking runway show.   Welcome back to #NYFW, @rodarte. The beauty editors thank you dearly for coming back. A post shared by  Jenna Rosenstein (@jennarosenstein) on Sep 9, 2018 at 4:06pm PDT Welcome back, Rodarte. New York missed you. 
 The designer has died at the age of 77. The fashion world mourns a legend today, with the news that the Tunisian-born couturier Azzedine Ala√Øa has died at the age of 77.  Famous for his precisely cut dresses that celebrated the female form, he was known for flouting the traditional fashion system, and achieving world renown on his own terms.  Largely known for his close relationships with iconic models such as his "adopted daughter" Naomi Campbell, Ala√Øa's admirers spread far and wide and include influential designers such as Alber Elbaz, Nicolas Ghesqui√®re and Mar√≠a Grazia Chiuri, as well as modern icons including Michelle Obama, Grace Jones and Tina Turner. Ala√Øa enjoyed a unique level of cult-like fame, rivalled only by the likes of Rei Kawakubo and Martin Margiela. Known for being a notorious perfectionist, and affectionately dubbed the "king of cling," he was born to wheat farmers in Tunisia where he later studied sculpture, a background that would later surface in his work. Ala√Øa would go on to begin a career in fashion in Paris where he eventually joined the team at Christian Dior for a short-lived stint at the house. Work with Guy Laroche and a string of private society clients followed. "From two seasons at Guy Laroche, I learned how. From the last elegant women in the world, I learned what," he once said.  Ala√Øa's fervent fan base grew from there, as women sought him out for his sexy, sculptural work that highlighted the body, rather than concealed it.  He was particularly famous for his iconic shows of the Eighties and Nineties, which often featured the original Supermodels Naomi Campbell‚Äîwhose career he helped build after unofficially "adopting" her at the age of 16‚ÄîCindy Crawford and Linda Evangelista.  Meanwhile, his dinner parties in Paris were famous experiences unto themselves, mostly because one never knew what famous faces would be in attendance. Guests ranged from the pop-culture A-list (Rihanna) to fashion elite (Rei Kawakubo). The couturier made headlines this past July when he returned to the Paris catwalk to present his first couture collection in six years, re-awakening his loyal fan base while gaining new followers through the frenzy his return created on social media. Ala√Øa had planned to open a shop in London in 2018.

 Smart outfits that'll take you from work to play. After a few dormant months of winter hibernation, warm weather is finally about to kick in. Of course, that means the plans are too: drinks after work on Friday, checking out a new show at the art museum on Saturday, catching up over brunch on Sunday. The tricky part is curating a closet to ensure you look on point for all of them. Here, five fresh looks that work just as well for your work day as they do the weekend. Consider them the outfits that work for you. From Coffee Meeting to Cocktails  SOREL Ella Slip-On, $90; Abel earrings, $120; Michael Lo Sordo blazer, $520; Topshop t-shirt, $25; Michael Lo Sordo Shorts, $270 Metallic footwear has been one of the season's biggest trends. When paired with a matching blazer and shorts combo, silver slip-ons are polished enough for the office but cool enough to break out on the weekend. When it comes to accessories, think simple: a classic tee and slim silver earrings. Indoor Screens to Rooftop Scenes SOREL Ella Criss Cross, $75; Leigh Miller earrings, $389; Merlette blouse, $300; Merlette skirt, $380; Officina del Poggio bag Comfort doesn't have to mean sloppy. This cotton poplin top and skirt combo work feel effortlessly chic when paired with simple sandals, perfect for all-day comfort at the office or browsing the Sunday farmer's market. Make it pop with accessories in a range of textures, like brushed gold hoop and a textural straw bag. From Desk to Date SOREL Ella Slide, $75; George Keburia sunglasses, $200; Edas bag, $435; Lisa Marie Fernandez dress, $795 With its longer hemline and flowy fit, a midi dress has enough coverage to make it work-appropriate without being too stuffy to break out for a drinks date‚Äîespecially when worn with simple slides that are meeting-appropriate and comfortable enough to walk around in past 5pm. Go for low-profile accessories like slim cat-eye sunglasses and a little-but-ladylike bag. From Client Meetings to Meeting the Parents SOREL Ella Sandal, $80; Toteme t-shirt, $120; Ora-C earrings, $173; Rylan Studio bag, $590; Faithfull the Brand pants, $190 Looking professional at the office doesn't always require heels. For a look that's simultaneously relaxed and serious, try wearing high-rise, wide-leg linen trousers with flat sandals in a neutral hue. Accessories like mixed metal earrings and a rattan crossbody bag add intrigue without straying too far from the color scheme. It's profesh enough to win a new client AND make a good impression with future in laws. From Full Inbox to Five-Star Dinner SOREL Ella Lace-Up, $110; Paula Mendoza bracelet; L'Afshar bag, $790; Annie Costello Brown earrings, $290; Mara Hoffman dress, $550 When it really starts to heat up, try a sleeveless turtleneck dress for cool minimalism that doesn't bare too much skin for work. Play off the stark lines of the dress with accessories that are bold in their restraint, like gladiator sandals, slim jewelry and a fuss-free bag devoid of excess design elements. It's the perfect item to help you feel in control during a busy work day, and polished enough for night.

 It's all in the hair. From landing her first beauty campaign to walking her first fashion month, Kaia Gerber is the biggest breakout star of the year. But as the 16-year-old continues to make a name for herself, the inevitable comparisons to her supermodel mom, Cindy Crawford, carry on. How could they not, though, with mother-daughter similarities as spot-on as theirs? Now the latest subject of comparison is their Versace campaigns. After walking for the designer in Milan this September (in the same show as her mom), Gerber landed a place in the brand's supermodel-filled ads, costarring with icons (and her mother's contemporaries) like Naomi Campbell and Christy Turlington. The teen poses in a pale blue logo tee, pants, and mini bag while sporting Versace medallions as jewelry, but the best part of her look is her massive hair.  The voluminous 'do is reminiscent of Crawford's in her Gianni Versace ads 30 years ago, in the Spring 1987 season. Even her and Gerber's facial expressions are the same, from their arched brows to their slightly-open mouths. Whether or not it was intentional, Gerber's mirroring of her mother is appropriate in her campagin, which features the Gianni Versace tribute collection, and nods to the past while looking ahead to the future. "This campaign represents the link between past and present. You need to know who you are, and where you are coming from, to build your future," Donatella Versace, who artistically directed the shoot, said of the ads. That explains why promising up-and-comers costar with iconic supers. Sounds like an ordinary day in the Gerber-Crawford household.

 The luxury brand is about to make its U.S. retail debut with a pop-up at The Webster. Update, 6/11/19: Good news for U.S. shoppers who've been waiting to try Rihanna's Fenty on IRL: the new brand is about to make its retail debut in New York.  On June 19, Fenty will take over The Webster in Soho for a pop-up shop of the new collection. The space will take over the first two floors of the luxury boutique (located at 29 Greene Street) through June 30. This marks the first time the Rihanna-helmed brand will be available to shop in a store outside of Paris, following its launch in May.  For those who can't wait until June 19th to shop Fenty, the first drop is already available to buy online at fenty.com.    Original Article, 5/29/19: Fenty is here. Earlier this month, LVMH and Rihanna confirmed they were launching a new luxury fashion house together: Fenty. And now that the brand has made its official debut in Paris, we finally have a full look at the Rihanna-designed collection.  A newly-released lookbook shows a range of denim pieces, elevated shirting, structured T-shirts, blazers, and wide-leg trousers in Fenty's first installment. The silhouettes feature a mix of cinched waists, strong, voluminous shoulders, and pleated details.  The collection also includes accessories, featuring a range of fanny packs, jewelry, strappy pointed sandals, and sporty eyewear. Rihanna did not come to play. 
 In a teaser video released before the brand's official launch, Rihanna makes quick (and sleuthy) cameos while styling looks from her first Fenty collection. She styles a diverse lineup of models in all monochromatic looks for a series of different photos.  
  Amongst the looks are all-white ensembles‚Äîincluding denim, separates, and shirt dresses. The outfits are all styled with sporty sunglasses and strappy sandals.  Similar styles appear in the official campaign images, shot by Glen Luchford.    The launch of the new brand will make for a historic one. It marks the first time LVMH has introduced and built a new brand since Christian Lacroix in 1987. More importantly, Rihanna will be the first woman of color to oversee a fashion house under LVMH.  "Women are forces of this earth. We are multifaceted, complex, vulnerable yet bulletproof, and FENTY speaks to all of our intricacies," Rihanna said in a statement from the brand. "Some days I want to be submissive, many days I‚Äôm completely in charge and most days I feel like being both....so it was imperative that we created a line versatile enough to embrace and celebrate us in that way. The collections are easily worn together and meant to be staples in our wardrobe. I‚Äôm just hyped to see people in my clothes, man." Bad Gal Riri herself modeled pieces from the new collection as well in a profile with New York Times Style Magazine. The rest of us will get to shop Fenty's new collection on May 29th, when it officially launches online at fenty.com. Or if you're in Paris, you can shop the new range at a pop-up store on May 24th.

 It all started when Kendall was 15 years old. Kendall Jenner made her Victoria's Secret Fashion Show debut in 2015, but she (and her mother, Kris) were already making connections with the brand years before that. Kendall was only 15 when she told her mom it was her dream to become a Victoria's Secret Angel someday, designer Tommy Hilfiger recalled in a conversation with Kris Jenner at WWD's CEO Summit. So the Kardashian matriarch did what she could to make her daughter's dream a reality, but there was a problem‚Äîshe didn't "know really anybody in the modeling industry," she revealed. However, it was when she was on a flight home from New York that Kris found a way in. Jenner came across a documentary on renowned Victoria's Secret photographer, Russell James, whom she called "the guy who could really discover VS models." When she got home, she researched him, somehow found his phone number, and left him a voicemail where she told him about Kendall and asked to meet with him. Eventually, James did call her back. Kris and the family were having lunch with her mother in San Diego‚Äîwhile filming Keeping Up with the Kardashians, no less‚Äîwhen the photographer returned her call. "This is Russell James and I would love to meet your daughter," Jenner recalled him saying on the phone. They set up a meeting with him and Kendall 10 days later at their house. "I said to Kendall, look, go upstairs and put on your cutest party dress," Kris remembered telling her daughter. "Brush your hair, put on your party shoes, and when he gets here, come downstairs." Kendall ultimately wore platform shoes, skinny jeans, and a cute top, but she made an impression on James nonetheless. "He said, 'You're right, she's beautiful, and I can't wait to work with her,'" Jenner said. James went on to shoot Kendall for his photography book, Angels, which released the year before her VS runway debut). Jenner ultimately walked the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show for the first time in 2015, and returned in 2016. However, she won't be present for this year's show due to a conflicting contract with another lingerie brand she models for, La Perla. 
 
 Same.  Known for his cool kid-approved streetwear, Alexander Wang is stepping outside his realm and getting a luxe upgrade for Spring 2018. The designer teamed up with Judith Leiber for a limited-edition, Swarovski-encrusted bag (that's shaped like a stack of $100 bills, of course). As WWD reports, the minaudi√®re is made of 10,263 black, gunmetal, green and clear Swarovski crystals. Accentuated with a real industrial rubber band and chain strap, the kistchy bag takes an entire week to hand-bead to completion. Purchasing it, however, will require an actual stack of $100 bills (and then some), as it costs a cool $4,995.    The collaboration with Leiber will make its official debut on Wang's Spring 2018 runway this September, but there's a catch: it will be produced in an extremely limited quantity of only 20. Members of the #WangSquad better act fast.  The Alexander Wang x Judith Leiber bag will be available at the Alexander Wang New York and London stores, Saks Fifth Avenue and alexanderwang.com in November. 
 The designer got political at his 10th anniversary show.  Last night, Prabal Gurung celebrated his 10th anniversary showing at New York Fashion Week. For the momentous occasion, the designer's Spring 2020 collection dove deeper than the latest trends by examining American identity and posing the question: "who gets to be American?" At a time of such immense political upheaval in the country, it's nearly impossible for fashion not to reflect on the turbulence. But Gurung, who's no stranger to political statements on the runway, didn't just slap a catchy slogan on a T-shirt and call it a day. Instead, his entire collection‚Äîfrom the colors to the prints and fabrics‚Äîre-examined and dissected the root of American identity.  "In the last few years, incited by the divisive rhetoric of our current administration, I've considered the many faces of America and how we should seek to redefine it," Gurung explained in his show notes. To do so, the designer tapped Jose Antonio Vargas, the author of Dear America: Notes of an Undocumented Citizen, to consult on the collection. Gurung, who's originally from Nepal, stumbled upon Vargas' work after someone in a business meeting said to him "you don't look American, so how can you define what America is?" From there, key elements of Americana were woven into the collection. Roses, which are the national flower of the United States, appeared in vibrant reds, colorful pastels, and bouquets carried by models. Denim‚Äîa classic American staple‚Äîtook new form in elevated dresses, trousers, and even a boiler jumpsuit. Similarly, white poplin shirting and patchwork pieces made appearances throughout the collection.     The extensive range of colors and prints along with the diverse cast of models were meant to represent the melting pot of race and culture that are at the root of what makes America great. It all came to culmination during the finale, when Gurung sent every model down the runway wearing a beauty pageant sash reading, "Who Gets to be American?" in bright blue letters.  So who does get to be an American? Instead of rehashing many of the problematic elements intertwined in this country's DNA, Gurung looked to the hope‚Äîand the dream‚Äîof what it could be. As Republicans and Democrats wage war against one another, as President Trump attempts to build a wall, as the administration holds refugees and babies in unsanitary detention centers, one Nepalese immigrant reminded us all‚Äîthrough the art of fashion, nonetheless‚Äîwhat the American dream really is.  Gurung himself said it best in his heartfelt show notes:

 Stars like the Hadids, Karlie Kloss, Gisele Bundchen, and Cara Delevingne also made the list.  Kendall Jenner is the highest-paid model in the world for the second year in a row, according to Forbes. The reality-star-turned-runway-favorite earned $22.5 million in the 12 months before June 2018, topping big names like Gisele B√ºndchen, Karlie Kloss, Chrissy Teigen, and her friends, Bella and Gigi Hadid.    Jenner has major modeling contracts to thank for her hefty salary. She's landed deals with brands like Adidas, Est√©e Lauder, Calvin Klein, and others, Forbes reports. The 23-year-old holds a strong lead, as Karlie Kloss comes in second with $13 million‚Äîwhich Forbes attributes to her deals with Swarovski, Adidas, Away luggage, and more.  B√ºndchen, whom Jenner dethroned as the highest-paid model in 2017, fell from second place to fifth in 2018, where she's tied with Cara Delevingne at $10 million. The runway vet released a memoir this year (Lessons: My Path to a Meaningful Life) amidst starring in ads for Stewart Weitzman and Brazilian brands.  1) Kendall Jenner: $22.5 million2) Karlie Kloss: $13 million3) Chrissy Teigen and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley: $11.5 million 5) Cara Delevingne and Gisele Bundchen: $10 million7) Gigi Hadid: $9.5 million8) Bella Hadid and Joan Smalls: $8.5 million10) Doutzen Kroes: $8 million  Forbes also reports that popularity online and on social media may help models branch out to other businesses. "Your social media page is your magazine of your life, so how you represent yourself matters. If you're going to crossover you have to have a vision for it," IMG Models President, Ivan Bart, told the outlet. For context, Jenner boasts 100 million followers on Instagram alone.  And although Kendall may be the highest-earning model, she's not quite the highest-earning Kardashian-Jenner. Her beauty mogul sister, Kylie Jenner, has an estimated net worth of $900 million and made $166.5 million in the year before June 2018, Forbes reports. 
 A tiny wardrobe malfunction couldn't stop her.  It's going to take more than a loose piece of jewelry to break Elsa Hosk's focus on the red carpet. The Swedish model and Victoria's Secret Angel happened to drop an earring while arriving to the Marriage Story premiere at the Venice Film Festival today, but she looked completely unfazed by the minor mishap.  While posing for the cameras, her left earring seemed to unlatch and fall to the ground. Still smiling, Hosk simply picked up the accessory and put it back in its place.  What wardrobe malfunction? To Hosk's credit, her earrings did look weighty. The chunky, dangling baubles featured a gold medallion design with accented pearls‚Äîit's a miracle they stayed in place to begin with. They did, however, nicely match the strapless black and gold Etro she wore to the premiere, coupled with matching bangles and black pumps.  Hosk made her first appearance at this year's Venice Film Festival yesterday at the La V√©rit√© screening, where she wore strappy black halter gown, also by Etro. Luckily for the model, her earrings, by Messika, were much smaller at the time.  Hosk isn't the only Victoria's Secret rep in Venice. Fellow Angels Martha Hunt, Candice Swanepoel, and Barbara Palvin also made stunning appearances on the red carpet. Keep up with all of the most glamorous looks from the festival below.

 The Pomellato for Women ambassador preaches a very millennial message of self-empowerment.  A vision in fluttery pink Dior, Chiara Ferragni wafts through Milan‚Äôs glass-domed Galeria Vittorio Emanuele II shopping arcade like a character in a Fellini film. Today Ferragni is shooting for Bazaar, and she‚Äôs all smiles for the camera. Teenagers in velvet puffer coats swarm around Italy‚Äôs most famous influencer like moths to a social media flame, reflexively extending their arms into the universal selfie pose. ‚ÄúChiara! Chiara!‚Äù they scream, as they frantically adjust their positioning to catch her in the background of their photos.  ‚ÄúI think we got it,‚Äù Ferragni says to our camera crew, turning decisively on her heel as two burly security guards swoop in to escort her through a secret passageway to escape the verklempt fans slowly closing in on her.   Graciously enduring mass hysteria is all in a day‚Äôs work for the OG of fashion bloggers, who is accustomed to sharing every minute of her glam-packed life with more than 16 million Instagram followers (to put her reach in perspective, Man Repeller has a following of 2.1 million, and Bryanboy is just shy of 700,000). In September, she‚Äôs poised to become even more of a household name when Italian director Elisa Amoruso‚Äôs documentary about her hits theaters. The film charts the meteoric rise of this dentist‚Äôs daughter from the bedroom community of Cremona, Italy, to number one in the fashion category on the 2017 Forbes Top Influencers list.  Ferragni was also recently tapped to be an ambassador of Pomellato for Women, the Milanese jewelry brand‚Äôs campaign celebrating female leadership. ‚ÄúChiara‚Äôs drive and resilience are remarkable,‚Äù says Pomellato CEO Sabina Belli. ‚ÄúShe invented a job that didn‚Äôt exist, and her message is powerful: It is up to each of us to break the glass ceiling to live the life that we imagine.‚Äù The 31-year-old new mother is happy to return the compliment. ‚ÄúPomellato‚Äôs values really resonate with me,‚Äù says Ferragni, whose son, Leo, just turned one. ‚ÄúI believe it‚Äôs possible to be both a boss and a mom‚Äîjust keep working toward everything you dreamed you‚Äôd do.‚Äù   Of course, Ferragni‚Äôs free designer clothes and front-row seats didn‚Äôt manifest themselves immediately. In 2009, when she first began posting #ootd photos on her blog, the Blonde Salad, she was still a college student studying international law. Those early looks‚Äîa strategic mix of designer handbags, vintage finds, and Zara‚Äîcaptivated fans, who followed her to Instagram in 2012. In 2013, she parlayed her loyal base into a cash cow by developing a namesake fashion line. As her audience continued to grow, she negotiated endorsement deals with a select group of luxury labels, which not only paid her handsomely for sponsored posts but also helped further elevate the profile of the Chiara Ferragni Collection by association. In 2015, Harvard Business School published a case study on her entrepreneurial success. Ferragni‚Äôs brand, which has an emoji-like winking eye as its signature motif, is now carried in more than 400 stores, including flagships in Milan, Paris, and Shanghai, and generates $25 million in annual revenue. ‚Ä∞ ‚ÄúThe secret to social media is not thinking about it too much.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe secret to social media is not thinking about it too much,‚Äù says Ferragni, who usually adds four to six photos to her main Feed daily, more than most people post on Stories. For Ferragni, every moment is a shareable one‚Äînot to mention a potential product placement opportunity. Although a fair amount of her content is sponsored, much of it isn‚Äôt. From romantic dinners with her Italian rapper husband, Fedez, to playground trips with their son, nothing is off-limits.   The couple‚Äôs nuptials in Sicily last year earned a cool $36 million in Media Impact Value for sponsor brands, according to the data analytics firm Launchmetrics. The highly Instagrammable, three-day extravaganza included a performance by the groom‚Äîa social media heavyweight in his own right, with 7.6 million followers‚Äîfireworks, a Ferris wheel, and a hashtag (#TheFerragnez). In terms of placements, the biggest winners were Dior (which provided two couture gowns for the big day‚Äîone embroidered with lyrics from ‚ÄúFavorisca I Sentimenti,‚Äù the song Fedez wrote to propose to Ferragni) and Prada (which supplied a bespoke crystal-covered cocktail dress for the rehearsal dinner). For its part, Pomellato contributed his-and-hers wedding bands swathed in pav√© diamonds. #TheFerragnez, by some calculations, generated even more online impact than the royal wedding, garnering 67 million interactions over four days.   Yes I do, forever üíç A post shared by  Chiara Ferragni (@chiaraferragni) on Sep 1, 2018 at 10:56am PDT  ‚ÄúIt was insane,‚Äù says Ferragni, sipping an espresso. We are sitting in a quiet corner of Pasticceria Marchesi, a retro-chic haven that looks like it was custom-built for Instagram. ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt believe Fedez and I got more buzz than a duchess and a prince.‚Äù ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt believe Fedez and I got more buzz than a duchess and a prince.‚Äù So what‚Äôs next for the queen bee of fashion partnerships? ‚ÄúFedez and I would love to do more projects together,‚Äù she says. With their very millennial digital fluency and unique celebrity nexus between the worlds of fashion and music, the similarity between the Ferragnez and Kimye‚Äîthe ne plus ultra of social media power couples‚Äîhas not been lost on them. Fedez coyly named a track on his latest album ‚ÄúKim & Kanye.‚Äù ‚ÄúI think Kim is a genius‚Äîshe‚Äôs created so many different businesses,‚Äù says Ferragni. ‚ÄúEverything Kim and Kanye do is gold.

 The new face of Chanel, Margot Robbie, compares notes with Karl Lagerfeld on their animal companions: Robbie‚Äôs rescue dog, Boo Radley, and Lagerfeld‚Äôs beloved cat, Choupette. HARPER‚ÄôS BAZAAR: How did you choose your pet‚Äôs name? MARGOT ROBBIE: To Kill a Mockingbird is one of my favorite books, and all the characters have such fantastic names.  KARL LAGERFELD: It was not my choice. She was born in a year when all the cats of her breed had to start with ‚ÄúC.‚ÄùI got her with this, at first view, horrible name. Now I love it! HB: What do you and your dog have in common, and what about your personalities is different? MR: We both like roseÃÅ and are grumpy in the mornings. Boo is utterly disinterested in food.   KL: As a human being, Choupette is better than me.  HB: How did you come to adopt your pet? MR: I searched Web sites that list puppies at animal shelters, and came across Boo and completely fell in love. KL: Choupette belonged to a friend who had gotten her asa gift when she was three months old. This friend had to leave for a trip, and he asked one of my maids if she could keep Choupette during the time he was away. When he came back I told him that I was very sorry, but Choupette would stay with me. HB: What do you think is the difference between cats and dogs, and between cat people and dog people? MR: I‚Äôve often thought that it‚Äôs about how you like to beloved. If you like dogs, you like big displays of outward devotion. Cats are like a sly, flirty grin across a bar. KL: Dogs are easily very nice with everyone. Cats are not.You feel when a cat is affectionate that it is a choice; she likes you. Dogs have the tendency to love everybody.

 Channeling 'Big Rihanna Energy'... In May, Rihanna and LVMH confirmed the launch of Fenty, the first luxury fashion house founded by the French fashion conglomerate since the unveiling of Christian Lacroix over thirty years ago. The superstar made history when she became the first black woman to helm a brand at LVMH.  At the time of the first collection launch (Fenty operates on a direct-to-consumer model with new collections dropping monthly), Rihanna released the following statement: "Women are forces of this earth. We are multifaceted, complex, vulnerable yet bulletproof, and Fenty speaks to all of our intricacies. Some days I want to be submissive, many days I‚Äôm completely in charge and most days I feel like being both ... so it was imperative that we created a line versatile enough to embrace and celebrate us in that way. The collections are easily worn together and meant to be staples in our wardrobe. I‚Äôm just hyped to see people in my clothes, man." With that spirit in mind, and in honor of the second collection ("Release 6-19") that dropped today, two BAZAAR.com editors gave Fenty a test-drive, wearing pieces from the line at the newly reopened early-2000s hot spot,  Pastis, in New York City's Meatpacking District. While the first release had an emphasis on strong tailoring and denim, including an already viral white minidress worn by Bella Hadid and Kristen Noelle Crowley, the second drop offers something very different. "The Fenty collection is definitely in line with what I like to wear, only it's a bit cooler and sexier thanks to Rihanna‚Äôs magical touch," Christina Rutherford, special projects director at BAZAAR.com explains. "If you have long legs like I do, there‚Äôs lots of options to show off your assets." While the inaugural Fenty drop was mostly black, tan, denim, and white, "Release 6-19" offers a wider range of bright, vivid colors like hot pink, teal, and orange, as well as a subtle black and white Japanese-inspired print.  Slinky slip dresses in knit, satin and jersey; plus scarf tops, and bandage miniskirts conjure a '90s Tom Ford-for-Gucci mood: simple lines, unapologetic, confident, sexy.  Shoes are strappy and high, offset with oversized graphic tees with the word "Immigrant" blast across them (a nod to Rihanna's Barbados roots and perhaps a political statement). The newest release also offers two new sunglasses styles: Techno Mask and Centerfold, statement shades that are unequivocally bold and fierce. For jewelry, statement pearls take the lead this time around, whereas gold and crystals brought the shimmer in the first collection. "She created the perfect denim dress," Rutherford explains. "I love how she played with proportions keeping the top oversized and boxy with an itsy-bitsy fitted skirt. The slip dress definitely felt a bit risqu√©, but I love throwing on a sexy dress every now and then. Not only is the print guaranteed to turn heads‚Äîbut also that hemline!" While I've mostly parted ways with slinky, fitted dresses, I channeled some "Big Rihanna Energy" and wore a fitted black gown with deep arm holes and a low-cut back, designed to flatter. The satin dress with a cowl neckline was similarly lightweight and well-fitted.  Chrissy and I styled drop one with drop two for a cool combination of strong-shouldered jackets and "going out" dresses‚Äîall coming in at a contemporary price point between $370 for tops to $810 for gowns.  One of the most awe-inspiring moments of my life, and I am not being hyperbolic, was seeing Rihanna arrive at the CFDA Awards in a crowd-stopping sheer dress covered in Swarovski crystals. To say that Rihanna has star power is an understatement. She's magnetic. These clothes are about bringing that confidence to women, that rare, raw, Rihanna energy. All the great fashion designers have a calling card‚ÄîPhoebe's unexpectedly exciting simplicity, Nicolas's reimagining of shape and form, Demna's sophisticated streetwear. Even though it's only two collections in, we think we're ready to answer the call of Rihanna's Fenty.  FENTY is available at fenty.com now and at a pop-up at The Webster (29 Greene Street) in NYC.   
 Everything you need to conquer the season. One of the best things about spring‚Äîsecond only to the relief from cold weather and way-too-early sunsets‚Äîis the new clothes that go with it. Moving from winter to warmer temps means saying goodbye to heavy knits and insulated jackets, and trading them in for breezy dresses, sleeveless tops, and open-toe shoes. And while you might not be making over your entire closet‚Äîwe're sure you have a few seasonal go-tos you're eager to pull out of storage‚Äînow's the time to infuse your existing rotation with a few fresh items. Here, we list the spring pieces worth investing in, from head to toe. Bally Cecyle Bag We love the rounded shape of Bally's Cecyle bag: a crossbody style that's just the right size to hold daytime essentials, but not too bulky for night.¬†The croc effect is on-trend this spring, and the neutral color works with everything from vibrant white to muted pastels, and even dark colors like navy, charcoal, and black. Oversized statement headbands were all over the runways last season, and they're the perfect accessory to take your look to the next level.¬† Bally Trench Coat The trench is a classic for a reason. Versatile, stylish, and smart for the unpredictable weather of the season, a trench coat in a light hue with a longer length is essential for transitioning between winter and summer. If you're going to invest in a piece of jewelry, a statement earring is still the look du jour.¬†Opt for a matching¬†pair, or if you're more daring, try a mismatched set. Bally mules Transition between seasons with an open-toe block heel. Not quite a sandal and definitely not a pump, it's an easy way to lighten up the feel of your look while still remaining polished. Without a doubt, the standout accessories of the season are barrettes and hair clips. Whether you opt for crazy or classic, it's the easiest way to work in a fun seasonal trend. Bally Sunglasses Give your face a lift with the flattering angles of this frame style and keep it from looking too severe by going with a mellow tortoiseshell finish rather than black. Worn open, a slightly oversized blazer in a traditional fabric makes a wonderful layer. Plus, it works equally well in the office or more casually with jeans on the weekend. One of the simplest ways to get your mind out of winter and into spring is with a polish swap. Embrace the light, bright mood of spring with warm peachy hues. They're¬†the perfect middle ground between winter neutrals and summer's vibrant hues.
 The model graduates from VS Pink to Angel status.  Grace Elizabeth is the fourth and final model to land a coveted spot as a Victoria's Secret Angel for 2019. Barbara Palvin, Alexina Graham and Leomie Anderson were also crowned VS Angels in the last four weeks. This particular announcement comes as little surprise‚Äîthe 22-year-old Florida native has been working with the brand as a Victoria's Secret PINK spokesmodel, and garnering a cult following since 2016. She made her first appearance on the runway for the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show in 2016 in Paris, opening up the pink section in wings adorned with bows.  Grace Elizabeth is down right angelic, with her high, prominent cheekbones and mega-watt smile which has brought her not only commercial success but prominence in the world of high fashion. She signed to Next Models at just 16 years old, booking jobs like Guess and Polo Ralph Lauren, and now you can see her in the pages of Harper's Bazaar styled by Carine Roitfeld. She's walked the runways from New York to Paris for brands like Ralph Lauren, Max Mara and Chanel.  We caught up with the new VS Angel over email and here's what she had to say about this career-making news.  Grace Elizabeth: I was in Tulum, Mexico on vacation laying by the beach when I got the exciting news. I told my mother. She had already seen the email come through and was counting down the minutes until I called her. I called her as soon as I saw and she answered, ‚ÄòHello, is this my angel?‚Äô  Happy birthday to these two amazing people in my life!! Luke we always said you were moms birthday present but now you just take all of moms birthdays presents. üòè I love you guys ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è A post shared by  Grace Elizabeth ‚ô° (@lovegrace_e) on Jun 18, 2018 at 5:40am PDT GE:It‚Äôs always been a dream of mine to be a Victoria‚Äôs Secret Angel. When I set out to model, it was my ultimate goal and it was one of the first things I told my agents I wanted to do. The transformation from being a PINK spokesmodel to being a VS Angel, has been really incredible. I have learned so much, met so many incredible people, some of who are like family to me. I‚Äôm looking forward to using this new platform to share my story, raise awareness for causes that are close to my heart and work to encourage other women to follow their dreams.  Career wise, it‚Äôs goals! It‚Äôs one of the most coveted contracts in fashion and can open up a wide range of opportunities. Plus, I get to work with some of the most amazing women in the biz.

 Rihanna and Amal Clooney are hosting. Next year's Met Gala is going to be a religious event‚Äîliterally. The Metropolitan Museum of Art's next big Costume Institute exhibit is titled, "Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination."  The collection, opening in 2018, will display about 50 garments and accessories loaned from the Vatican, works of religious art from the Met's own collection and 150 designer pieces "inspired by Catholic iconography or style," The New York Times reports. Featured brands will include no-brainers like Versace (a sponsor of the exhibit) and Dolce & Gabbana, who have famously included religious symbolism in their designs, and some surprising picks, like a Chanel wedding dress inspired by a communion gown and Valentino couture gowns inspired by monks' robes, according to NYT. Rihanna and Amal Clooney are two of the honorary chairs hosting next year's Met Gala. Although they're not specifically known for Catholic-inspired fashion, both are touted as modern fashion icons‚Äîthe singer for her shameless, boundary-pushing wardrobe (and consistent winning Met looks) and the human rights attorney for her elegant, classic style, both in the workplace and on the red carpet.  Donatella Versace, Anna Wintour and Stephen A. Schwarzman and his wife, who are big donors to the Catholic Archdiocese of New York, are also honorary chairs. "Heavenly Bodies" follows "Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Gar√ßons: Art of the In-Between" in 2017, "Manus x Machina: Fashion in an Age of Technology" in 2016, and "China: Through the Looking Glass" in 2015. Next year's exhibit is expected to be the Costume Institute's biggest one yet, stretching 58,600 square feet in three galleries, including the Cloisters in upper Manhattan. The theme will also likely be provocative. "We know it could be controversial for right wing or conservative Catholics and for liberal Catholics," head curator Andrew Bolton told NYT. However, he clarified that the exhibit focuses "on a shared hypothesis about what we call the Catholic imagination and the way it has engaged artists and designers and shaped their approach to creativity, as opposed to any kind of theology or sociology. Beauty has often been a bridge between believers and unbelievers." Bolton even got the OK from the Vatican (but he doesn't know whether the Pope Francis is aware of the exhibit). The director of the Holy See press office told NYT, "The Roman Catholic Church has been producing and promoting beautiful works of art for centuries. Most people have experienced that through religious paintings and architecture. This is another way of sharing some of that beauty that rarely gets seen." Bolton started discussing loaning items from the Vatican in 2015 and had to make eight trips to Rome to bring the show to life. Ultimately, the Vatican pieces will be displayed separately from the rest of the fashion exhibit in the Met out of respect, since these are still "working garments." The last time papal garments made their way across the Atlantic was in 1983, for "The Vatican Collections" exhibit at the museum, which saw over 855,000 guests.  Of course, New York's archbishop Cardinal Dolan was invited to the Met Gala, the Times reports. The paper writes, "Everyone is hoping he will attend."
 The brand plans to close up to 178 stores in the U.S. and halt operations in 40 countries.  Forever 21 officially filed for bankruptcy on Sunday, The New York Times reports. It will close up to 178 stores in the U.S. and up to 350 overall, but will continue to run its website, according to the paper. The company will also cease operations in 40 countries, including Canada and Japan, as a result of the bankruptcy filing.  The fast-fashion franchise is hoping to "simplify things so we can get back to doing what we do best," Forever 21's Executive Vice President Linda Chang told NYT. Forever 21 is reportedly considering filing for bankruptcy as sales decline, sources with knowledge of the plans have told Bloomberg and CNBC. The fast fashion retailer was already negotiating additional financing options and working with advisors to restructure the company's debt, but those discussions have stalled, according to Bloomberg.    Weeks ago, the outlet reported that Forever 21‚Äîwhich makes an estimated $3 billion per year in sales‚Äîwas struggling to pay vendors and landlords and was seeking out ways to "revive its business." By filing for bankruptcy, the brand may be able to "shed unprofitable stores and recapitalize the business," Bloomberg reports, citing anonymous sources familiar with the negotiations.    WEAR NOW & LATER | stock up on outfit staples to transition into the new season üçÇ -- Search: 00369001 (tap to shop) A post shared by  forever21 (@forever21) on Aug 21, 2019 at 5:23pm PDT  At the time of writing, Forever 21 has not announced any plans to close any of its over 800 locations across the U.S. However, as CNBC points out, many of its branches are located in malls, which are seeing fewer shoppers. Similar fast fashion brick-and-mortars are also fighting (and, at times, failing) to keep up with online and or direct-to-consumer brands. The U.K.-based brand TopShop, for example, also recently filed for bankruptcy and closed all of its U.S. stores as a result.  The L.A. Times also projected that Forever 21 lost its "cool factor" and had widened its range of merchandise too broadly. "They‚Äôve lost sight of what brought them there," Roger Beahm, executive director of the Center for Retail Innovation at Wake Forest University, told the paper in July.  BAZAAR.com has reached out to Forever 21 for comment. 
 The brand will present its Fall 2018 collection with a digital presentation instead.  Joining a growing list of designers, Marchesa is the latest to pull out of New York Fashion Week.  Moving away from the traditional runway show format, the fashion house will instead unveil its Fall 2018 collection through a digital presentation. The brand, which is helmed by Georgina Chapman and Keren Craig, confirmed its decision in a statement to the New York Post:"Marchesa is looking forward to presenting their Fall 18 collection in an updated format this season." The news comes after some of New York's biggest designers, including Proenza Schouler, Rodarte, Altuzarra, Public School, and more, have opted out of the traditional New York Fashion Week calendar. Most recently, Alexander Wang announced this February would be his last time showing during New York Fashion  Week. Instead, the brand will present its collections in June and December moving forward.   Of course Chapman, the estranged wife of Harvey Weinstein, may have other reasons for moving her brand away from a traditional runway show format. The designer reportedly decided to cancel the Fall 2018 show, originally scheduled for Valentine's Day, in the aftermath of the sexual harassment and assault allegations against Weinstein. After the allegations against Weinstein became public in October, Chapman announced she was leaving her husband. The two had been married since 2007 and have two children together, aged four and seven. Weinstein has since denied all allegations of nonconsensual sex. "My heart breaks for all the women who have suffered tremendous pain because of these unforgivable actions. I have chosen to leave my husband. Caring for my young children is my first priority and I ask the media for privacy at this time," the designer said in a statement to People. 
 Mimi Cuttrell's collection has all the '90s power vibes her clients love.  Mimi Cuttrell has been creating the highly photographed looks of some of your go-to sources of sartorial inspiration for many years. She counts Gigi and Bella Hadid, and Priyanka Chopra as clients. While she gravitates toward cool, young brands to provide them with their own unique style profiles, she's taking matters into her own hands with a new denim collaboration with 3x1, launching today. "I started with some of my favorite vintage denim pieces from my personal collection," Cuttrell says of her straightforward approach to the 12-piece line. "These served as a great base. ‚Ä¶ The next step was to focus on the fit. As a stylist, I am constantly transforming outfits with the art of tailoring. It was so important to me that these pieces would have a loose, comfortable fit, but are tight and formfitting in the best places." The vintage-inspired collection is composed of  a signature top, a reversible jacket, and denim bottoms ranging from '90s-era dad jeans to stretch super-flares, modeled after the pink matching set that Cuttrell styled Gigi in. "The Kellie Jean is a special case, 3x1 has a split bell that I've been pulling for years, and it's a favorite among a few of my clients. We updated this style with a double-slit on both side seams and a permanent pleat down the center for a dressier feel. I loved adding this new twist." Each style is named after a special person in Cuttrell's life: The dad jean is appropriately named for her father, Kirk; the Diana Jean is for her style inspiration Princess Di; and the The G.I. Tank and B Jacket are self-explanatory. A true denim lover, the stylist considers jeans the perfect base to any outfit. "My ideal denim outfit would consist of a cashmere turtleneck sweater and a nice pair of boots‚Äîmaybe even UGGs. In the summer, I love to pair them with my favorite Birkenstocks and a simple tee." That's some expert advice right there.
 The luxury fashion group is also changing its name.  Update, 9/25: Following rumors, Michael Kors Holdings has officially bought Versace for $2.12 billion. In its acquisition of the iconic Italian fashion house, the Michael Kors Holdings fashion group will change its name to Capri Holdings.  "This is a very exciting moment for Versace,‚Äù Donatella Versace said in a statement, ‚ÄúIt has been more than 20 years since I took over the company along with my brother Santo and daughter Allegra. I am proud that Versace remains very strong in both fashion and modern culture. Versace is not only synonymous with its iconic and unmistakable style, but with being inclusive and embracing of diversity, as well as empowering people to express themselves. Santo, Allegra and I recognize that this next step will allow Versace to reach its full potential." The Italian designer added, "We are all very excited to join a group led by John Idol, whom I have always admired as a visionary as well as a strong and passionate leader. We believe that being part of this group is essential to Versace‚Äôs long-term success. My passion has never been stronger. This is the perfect time for our company, which puts creativity and innovation at the core of all of its actions, to grow.‚Äù  The Versace family will become shareholders of Capri Holdings Limited, with Donatella keeping her role as creative director of the fashion house. Capri Holdings, formerly Michael Kors Holdings, now has three major fashion houses under its portfolio: Michael Kors Collection, Jimmy Choo, and Versace. "The acquisition of Versace is an important milestone for our group...We believe that the strength of the Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo brands, and the acquisition of Versace, position us to deliver multiple years of revenue and earnings growth," John D. Idol, CEO of Michael Kors Holdings Limited, said in a release. He added, "Donatella‚Äôs iconic style is at the heart of the design aesthetic of Versace. She will continue to lead the company‚Äôs creative vision. I am thrilled to have the opportunity to work with Donatella on Versace‚Äôs next chapter of growth.‚Äù Original Article, 9/24: In a major fashion industry shakeup, Michael Kors is reportedly set to buy Versace in a two-billion-dollar deal. Though not officially confirmed, the news is rumored to be announced as early as this week.  According to Business of Fashion, US fashion group Michael Kors Holdings Ltd. is close to an agreement to buy Gianni Versace S.p.A, the private Italian fashion company under the creative reins of Donatella Versace. In the reported deal, the Versace family would continue to have a role in their company.  Though Versace is a privately owned company, Blackstone Group LP, a US-based private equity group, bought a 20-percent stake in Versace back in 2014. It's unclear if the group would sell its stake to Michael Kors Holdings in the rumored deal.  If true, this would be Michael Kors' latest move to expand its portfolio of luxury brands. Just last year, the brand acquired luxury British shoe brand Jimmy Choo in a  $1.2 billion deal. Of course, Kors and Versace make for an interesting pairing. While Versace is famous for its over-the-top glitz and signature Italian glamour, Kors is the antithesis of that aesthetic, with a focus on affordable luxury and all-American ready-to-wear collections. HarpersBAZAAR.com has reached out to Michael Kors for comment and will update this post.

 There are dogs and chickens are involved too.  Harry Styles has long been the unofficial poster child for Gucci's floral and printed suits (Exhibit A). So it only makes sense that the fashion house is now making things official by casting the singer and style muse in its Fall 2018 men‚Äôs tailoring campaign. The new ads, which were photographed in North London by Glen Luchford, feature Styles in a variety of tailored Gucci looks‚Äìfrom three-piece suits to a mohair jacket to a suit adorned with New York Yankees patches. And just in case the vision of the singer in the Alessandro Michele-designed suiting wasn't swoon-worthy enough, he also stars alongside a group of dogs and pet chickens.   Along with the photo campaign, Gucci blessed us all with a video which features Styles bringing his pet chicken to a fish and chip shop for a casual bite to eat, as you do.  Here is Harry feeding a group of dogs some fish and chips in a printed three-piece suit and diamond "Guccy" brooch.  And here he is cradling a very lucky chicken in his many Gucci rings and floral embroidered jacket.  Despite the style icon's many Gucci-designed looks over the year (including his last world tour which featured custom pieces designed by Alessandro Michele), this surprisingly marks his first official campaign for the brand. And something tells us it probably won't be his last. 
 The London-based designer is best known for her colorful prints.  With just a month until the 2018 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show, the lingerie brand has announced its designer collaboration for this year's runway. Following last year's capsule collection with Balmain's Olivier Rousteing, the brand has tapped Mary Katrantzou to design a section of this year's show.  Katrantzou, often referred to as the "Queen of Prints," is known for her colorful, feminine designs and out-of-this-world prints. Always a favorite at London Fashion Week, the UK-based designer has been worn by the likes of Rihanna, Cate Blanchett, and Beyonc√© over the years.    "Everything that Victoria‚Äôs Secret creates is about a woman feeling confident and empowered‚Äîand also having fun with what she is wearing, This collaboration is going to be bold, fun and playful,‚Äù Katrantzou said in a statement from the brand.  The Victoria‚Äôs Secret x Mary Katrantzou capsule collection will make its debut on the runway at this year's VS Fashion Show, which is returning to New York City this November after previously holding shows in Shanghai and Paris. Immediately after the show airs, the Mary Katrantzou-designed pieces will be available to shop both online and in stores for holiday.  The collaboration marks the second time Victoria's Secret has partnered with a luxury fashion brand for its annual show. The first was last year's capsule collection with Olivier Rousteing of Balmain. The French designer created a range of looks for the show, which hit stores after the show aired.  While a lot of details have yet to be released about this year's VS Fashion Show, we do know at least 18 new models will make their debut in the show, including Winnie Harlow, Duckie Thot, and Sadie Newman. It will also be the first Victoria's Secret show in 17 years without Alessandra Ambrosio, who retired from the runway last year.  But the real question is: who will wear the million-dollar Fantasy Bra this year?
 And she looked so good... When taking style risks, it's always helpful to be an actual model, but there's no denying Cara Delevingne's paid off at today's royal wedding. The Brit actress arrived to Princess Eugenie's wedding at St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle in a full top and tails ensemble.  Her well-tailored black tuxedo suit comes complete with a cropped jacket with tails and ankle-length, waist-cinching trousers, layered over a simple white button-down. But it's the accessories that really nail it.  Delevingne layered a black silk cummerbund over her suit and finished the look with a silver single-knot tie and classic black pumps for a little feminine flair. Ever the thespian, she brings drama to the look, topping it off with an actual top hat, and a match in the corner of her mouth. 
  While hats are de rigueur at royal weddings, most women opt for frilly fascinators with veils, embroidery and appliques. Delevingne's borrowed-from-the-boys approach is refreshing and decidedly high-fashion, channeling the Old Hollywood glamour of Marlene Dietrich.  Delevingne and Princess Eugenie reportedly became friends via London's social circles. According to the Daily Mail, Delevingne attended Eugenie's 25th birthday party in June 2015. Later that year, the two were photographed leaving a Fashion Week party at club LouLous, a private members club in Mayfair, according to Bustle.  The London-born model is rumored to be dating actress Ashley Benson, but the two did not attend today's nuptials together. Instead, from photos, it appears that former Harper's BAZAAR editor-at-large Derek Blasberg served as her date for the wedding. 
 Kendall Jenner's mini-dress is stunning. A plethora of celebs and influencers stepped out for the 9th Annual Veuve Clicquot Polo Classic in Los Angeles this weekend.  Taking place in Will Rogers State Historic Park, the impressive turnout included model Kendall Jenner, Grey's Anatomy star Ellen Pompeo, Riverdale's Vanessa Morgan, and Crazy Rich Asians star Harry Shum Jr.  Here, some of the best looks from the latest Veuve Clicquot Polo Classic:
 Danai Gurira, Brie Larson, and Nicole Kidman have all sported stunning confections from the American label. What is it like dressing Yalitza Aparicio for the 2019 Oscars? "Delightful," says Kate Mulleavy, one-half of the design duo behind celebrated American fashion label Rodarte. Alongside her collaborator and sister Laura Mulleavy, the pair has become one of the go-to designers for ethereal, ultra-feminine, and drama-filled gowns.  Their romantic-meets-moody aesthetic has drawn plenty of admiration from Hollywood starlets, who rely on their craftsmanship to create stunning red carpet-worthy gowns. Here, we took a look back at the most standout Rodarte confections, through the lens of Kate and Laura Mulleavy, who exclusively share inside details behind their favorite celebrity red carpet moments. "It was so thrilling to create a custom gown for our friend's premiere," said Kate Mulleavy. "Brie worked tirelessly to create this character and seeing the culmination of all her hard work and diligence on opening night was overwhelming,"  "Working with Yalitza on choosing the material and silhouette on this gown was delightful," said Kate Mulleavy. "We really worked with her and her stylist to capture her personality in a gown. It was joyous and celebratory of her experience with the film Roma." "We admire Danai so much as an actor and playwright and working on this gown so closely with her was so inspiring," said Laura Mulleavy. "The inspiration point for the gown was a fire lily and you can really see that in the dramatic tones and materials used in the final piece." "This polka-dot rose is one of our favorite gowns we have ever made," said Kate Mulleavy. "Margot wore it with such beauty and grace that she took it from a beautiful gown to an iconic moment in our career." "Greta was the fifth woman nominated for Best Director at the Academy Awards. Making this dress for this moment was an honor and a delight," said Laura Mulleavy. "We were so proud of her voice being recognized. The dress is a reflection of the beauty and happiness she felt in the acknowledgement of her work." "Kirsten is a sister and best friend and we worked with her for three years on our first feature film, Woodshock. She is a true inspiration to us and we had written the role of Theresa for her," said Laura Mulleavy. Her sister adds: "The premiere event at the Venice Film Festival is a time in our lives that we will never forget. It was romantic and exciting and a first time experience that we were so honored to share with her in Italy." "We are such great admirers of Nicole Kidman‚Äôs body of work and her exquisite taste in fashion. This look that she wore to Cannes Film Festival was jaw dropping," said Kate Mulleavy. "This was our first experience working with Tessa and her love of the materials in this gown made us immediately feel a kinship with her. We have such similar taste in art, film, and music," said Laura Mulleavy. "Making the gown for Natalie‚Äôs Academy Award appearance for Black Swan was a pinnacle moment in a two-year journey we took with her," said Laura Mulleavy. "From making the ballet costumes for the film, to making the principle character costumes for her character, to making dresses and gowns for the premiere events for the film, and being a friend we were able to create an Oscar gown that celebrated her iconic and brilliant performance." Kate Mulleavy adds: "Seeing her nominated and winning at the Oscars was one of the most special moments of our career."

 The brand introduces another drug-inspired accessory. Vetements doesn't stray far from provocative‚Äîand at times questionable‚Äîdesigns. (Remember the butt-zipper jeans and weed grinder necklace?) But one accessory in its recently-released Fall 2017 collection proved the brand has actually outdone itself. Enter the snuff necklace, a silver chain and pendant that features a "tubular compartment pendant with turn-screw opening featuring integrated spoon hardware." In other words, it's a coke necklace. This actually isn't our first time seeing the accessory. The brand first released the necklace last year and flaunted it on Instagram.   In stock @kuznetskymost20 A post shared by  VETEMENTS (@vetements_official) on Dec 1, 2016 at 7:36am PST And it teased the pendant again before releasing the fall collection to retail. The grinder necklace and a matching lighter case are also in the mix.

 The designer has pledged to donate proceeds from her handbag sales to Save the Children. A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. For designer Gabriela Hearst, her genius plan to use her hero handbags as a vehicle to raise awareness for the severe drought in east Africa‚Äîwhich has left vast swaths of the continent from South Sudan to Tanzania parched and on the brink of famine‚Äîcame when she traveled more than seven thousand miles from her home in New York to Turkana County, Kenya with Save the Children. This week only you can skip the (miles long) wait-list to purchase Hearst‚Äôs ultra-covetable Nina bag and other sculptural leather totes on Net-a-Porter and at Bergdorf Goodman, where they are available for the first time, and support her pledged $600,000 donation to Save the Children towards food, livestock and clean water to see more than 1,0000 families through the next harvest. Here she talks with Harper‚Äôs Bazaar exclusively about her experiences in Kenya, the looming hunger emergency, and why fashion must be more conscious. HARPER'S BAZAAR: How did you decide to get involved with Save The Children‚Äôs famine relief efforts in Kenya? GABRIELA HEARST: I've been very worried about the drought in the semi-arid region of Africa because there are around 20 million people at risk of famine. Camels are dying. When camels are dying, it's a problem. Dying of hunger is not a good way to die. The way I see it is the big picture: this is our future. Climate change is the number one threat to us as a species. We live in our bubbles of comfort, of air conditioning and pre-made things and don‚Äôt like to think about it, but what's happening there, it's going to happen to all of us. HB: And so you went there? GH: I wanted to go see it with my own eyes. I wasn‚Äôt sure what I wanted to do but I knew that I wanted to help because I felt like there was a direct connection to what I care about, which is women and the environment. I traveled with Save the Children president and CEO Carolyn Miles in July. We visited mobile health centers, which are basically huts, where every two weeks the field workers come and do mass screening for malnutrition where they measure the circumference of the head, the circumference of the arms. They give out these lifesaving Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food packets that are flavored like peanut butter and contain 500 calories. They also treat the children for respiratory infection and other illnesses that malnutrition can cause. HB: What was the most surprising thing you witnessed? GH: Some of the mothers said to me, ‚ÄúWe're going to go to the river,‚Äù and at the river, there was no river. It was just a dry riverbed where the women dig holes for hours to get water. I realized that women, we're the same everywhere. We have to fight for our kids. HB: Did your experience match your preconceptions? GH: I thought I was going to feel a lot of sadness, but what I felt was admiration. One of the most inspiring things I experienced was home visits to children in recovery. These women lost everything, they have no more animals. Yet they are still striving and doing everything they can to survive. Save the Children also runs a cash transfer program that provides families with a $50 monthly stipend for the things they most urgently need, food and livestock. The problem is that in the region where I was there's 1,000 families, and Save the Children only has funds to cover 100 of them. And so, I came back and I was like, "this is what I want to target"‚Äîbecause obviously the problem is so big, and it needs a lot of attention that it's not getting and my hope is that more donors will step forward‚Äîbut I could raise $600,000 to cover the rest of the families that Save the Children couldn't cover. Gabriela Hearst bags, $1,495-$2,795, net-a-porter.com. SHOP HB: How did you devise your fundraising strategy? GH: I asked myself what is my hottest commodity? And it's the Nina and my other bags. When I talked to Net-a-Porter and Bergdorf Goodman, they really wanted to help, and so we thought of the idea of having the bags available for one week only, from October 1st and October 8th. I need to sell around 1,000 bags to cover the $600,000 I‚Äôve pledged. I‚Äôve signed the contract already, so I better come up with it!
 She's just one button away from being naked. Kim Kardashian's New York Fashion Week style so far has been experimental, and borderline naked. Not only has she worn sheer tights as pants, the reality star just wore a Vivienne Westwood trench coat as a dress. And there's just one tiny button holding the whole look together: As always, Kim manages to make the tiniest amount of clothing look super chic. Most of us wouldn't dare to leave the house in just a trench coat, but the app mogul has no fear, and makes the look work. Plus, the coat totally compliments her new silver blonde hair.
 A Central Saint Martins grad student just won the L‚ÄôOr√©al Young Talent Award for these innovative designs.  Every once in a while, a runway design captures the entire internet's attention for its lavishness, quirkiness, or even ridiculousness. But last night, a Central Saint Martins graduate student debuted a collection that made all of our jaws drop for its never-before-seen innovation.  Fredrik Tjaerandsen, a Norwegian grad student, presented a collection of shape-shifting balloon dress designs at the college's annual BA Fashion show. What began as giant colorful balloons quickly transformed into rubber dresses and two-piece top and skirt sets. The videos, which have unsurprisingly taken over Instagram, are completely mesmerizing and mind-blowing to watch.   Tjaerandsen's avant-garde designs took home the L‚ÄôOr√©al Professionnel Young Talent Award last night, the highest award Central Saint Martins' design students can receive. In an interview with Love Magazine, the design student revealed how the inflatable balloon garments work. ‚ÄúI have constructed these pieces with an air pressure system that lets the wearer control the air-flow," he said. "Whenever the wearer wants to deflate it, they open a latch inside to release the inverted bubble part and then that dives out of the deflating bubble." Done in an array of bright colors, models demonstrated how the designs work in real-time on the runway. As they walked, they activated the latch inside the balloon to transform the piece into a wearable rubber dress.   At the end of the show, the designer posed with his looks on the runway upon receiving his award. And given the fact that this is just the beginning of his career, we can bet this is only the first we'll see of Tjaerandsen's work in fashion.  You can watch the full BA Fashion Show below:
 This marks the first time a womenswear brand has collaborated with legendary band.  Taking the merch trend to new heights, Alice + Olivia is joining forces with The Beatles for a limited-edition capsule collection.  Paying homage to the legendary band's most iconic works, the 15-piece collection is notable as it marks the first time a womenswear brand has collaborated with the band. And while we've all grown accustomed to the streetwear-infused tour merch from Kanye West, Kendrick Lamar, and more, Alice + Olivia's take on Beatlemania brings a much-welcomed sunny, bright, and retro vibe to the merch scene.  From a t-shirt dress emblazoned with the classic ‚ÄúAbbey Road‚Äù album cover to a sequined bomber jacket reading "Come Together" (which feels just as fitting in 2017 as it did in 1969), the pieces puts a modern-day spin on the band's '60s-infused aesthetic.  The limited-edition collection coincides with the U.S. premiere of the documentary, The Beatles: Eight Days a Week: The Touring Years,‚Äù which premieres on PBS November 25. Ranging in price from $195-$1,295, the Alice + Olivia x The Beatles collection is available to pre-order online now‚Äîshop the pieces below. 
 How to dress like the Duchess of Sussex.  At this point, it's no secret that we're royally obsessed with Meghan Markle's style. From her first public outing with Prince Harry, the Duchess of Sussex has crafted a minimal, chic, and ultra-modern royal wardrobe. Whether she's wearing a little black dress or a plush wrap coat, the royal brings a bit of understated elegance to all of her looks. In the spirit of channeling her style, we're rounding up all of Meghan's signature pieces and where to shop them. And because most of her looks sell out as soon as she wears them, we also rounded up some alternative options that are sure to get the Meghan stamp of approval. Click through to shop them all.  When it comes to outerwear, the duchess has a penchant for minimalist looks that make a statement. From plush neutral wrap coats to oversized double-breasted jackets and classic trenches, Meghan proves the classics always work well when it comes to coats.  Meghan's ultra-chic Mackage coat is still available to shop in the sand hue she prefers. Though the Duchess' tartan Burberry coat is sold out, this double-breasted coat achieves the same look in another Meghan-approved color scheme.¬† Showing her love for a British wardrobe staple, Meghan has proven a classic trench coat is always timeless and chic. This option offers an¬†affordable way to get the look.¬†¬† While pregnant, the Duchess of Sussex wore this chic cream coat to a gala with Prince Harry. Take note from her and wear it with a white ensemble for a monochromatic look.¬† The Duchess of Sussex opts for neutral, structured bags no matter what the occassion. For a dressier look, she typically accessorized with a black and gold clutch. For a larger bag‚Äîwhether a tote or ladylike caryall‚Äîshe loves a cognac leather look.  Worn for Meghan's first public outing with Prince Harry, this buttery leather tote bag is a wardrobe essential for any woman‚Äîroyal or not. A fan of black and gold clutches, Meghan carried this Kayu bag while arriving to Fiji for an official royal tour.¬† As for handbags, Meghan often carries a structured ladylike handbag‚Äîlike this Strathberry style she's toted on multiple occasions.¬† Meghan has proven a midi pencil skirt is anything but boring‚Äîespecially when done in leather or flared silhouettes.   For a visit to Nottingham Academy, Meghan styled a camel¬†midi skirt with a black turtleneck and knee-high boots for an ultra-chic¬†classic moment. This similar piece can achieve the same look just as well.¬† Giving the classic 9-to-5 pencil skirt an update, Meghan opted for a green leather skirt for a public outing. Though her exact Hugo Boss skirt has since sold out, this black Stella McCartney option still feels duchess-approved.¬† Olive green has proven to be one of the duchess' go-to colors. This affordable belted version is perfect for the office and beyond.¬† Meghan tends to stick to the classics, typically opting for crisp button-downs and turtlenecks that illustrate why less is more.  Worn by Meghan on her first public outing with Prince Harry, this classic white button-down is aptly called "The Husband Shirt."¬† The Duchess is a fan of both turtlenecks and sustainable fashion brand Everlane, making this the perfect Meghan-approved¬†wardrobe staple.¬† Worn with a pair of white, wide-leg trousers, Meghan stepped out in this blue-and-white button-down for an outing with Kate Middleton at Wimbledon.¬†¬† When it comes to footwear, Meghan's style is ladylike and simple. Think classic pointed toe pumps, Rothy's flats, and leather knee-high boots.  On numerous occasions, the Duchess has rocked these classic black pumps with cut-out detailing and a tassel. Perfect for a sexy night out or a dressed-up meeting at the office.¬† A fan of Sarah Flint shoes, Meghan wore these flats on her first public outing with Prince Harry.¬†Wear these with jeans for a more casual look, or with a dress for the office.¬† ¬† While on the royal tour of Australia, Meghan wore these under-$200 boots with a pair of skinny jeans and her gray checked blazer by Serena Williams.¬†¬† Making for her most affordable (and practical) shoe yet, the Duchess of Sussex wore these flats while at a beach event on the royal tour of Australia.¬† Whether it's with a bright colorful dress or a neutral pencil skirt, she can't stop, won't stop wearing suede nude pumps. Her favorite pair? These classic Manolo pumps.¬† Meghan topped off an all-black ensemble with these ultra chic black leather boots. Wear them with jeans, midi dresses, or skirts throughout fall and winter.¬†¬† One of the royal's most defining style signatures is the blazer, whether paired with dark-wash jeans or draped over her shoulders with a dress.  Though the Serena Williams blazer Meghan wore with skinny jeans and boots instantly sold out, this checked H&M blazer achieves the same look.¬† Back in the spring, Meghan draped this buttoned blazer over her shoulders for an editor-approved look.¬† Meghan styled a similar white striped blazer by¬†L'Agence¬†(it has since sold out)¬†with a black turtleneck and pants while on the royal tour of Australia.¬† And let's not forget one of Meghan's most memorable blazer looks:¬†a little black tuxedo dress which¬†she wore to an evening viewing of¬†Hamilton¬†at London's West End.¬† When it comes to dresses, the Duchess leans towards midi hemlines and modern silhouettes‚Äîand predominantly favors Audrey Hepburn-inspired boat neck silhouettes.  
 Tomo Koizumi's runway debut starred Gwendoline Christie, EmRata, Bella Hadid, Rowan Blanchard, and more. It was a quiet, windy Friday night in the midst of a lackluster New York Fashion Week schedule. When the fashion crowd showed up for the debut of an unknown Japanese costume designer, they weren't sure what to expect. What unfolded, however, was one of those rare, magical fashion moments that takes the whole room's breath away.  Dramatic gowns of rainbow confection cascaded down a sweeping staircase. An impressive cast of models, from actresses Gwendoline Christie and Rowan Blanchard to models Bella Hadid, Emily Ratajkowski, Joan Smalls, and Karen Elson hit the runway. A grand finale of colorful gowns led to even grander applause. All this for the work of Tokyo-based costume designer Tomo Koizumi, who was discovered on Instagram a mere month ago.  Koizumi's New York Fashion Week debut was a parade of dreamy, cloud-like gowns in a spectrum of striking colors. But it was also a modern-day fashion fairytale. Stylist Katie Grand discovered the Japanese designer's work while scrolling Instagram last month and immediately reached out to see if he wanted to do a show. The rest is history.   Editors and industry insiders squeezed into the lower level of Marc Jacobs' Madison Avenue store, a space Jacobs had offered for the show. Pat McGrath did the makeup, Guido Palau the hair. The music was quiet, but the over-the-top tulle gowns did all the talking.     Koizumi is not a trained fashion designer. According to a WWD profile, he's a self-taught costume designer from Tokyo, where he works with just one assistant. This week marks his second-ever visit to New York and his first time meeting Grand in person. Neither she nor Koizumi know what the designer's future looks like in the fashion industry, but the stylist felt passionate about sharing his work at New York Fashion Week.   "We know what‚Äôs going to happen every season or what the process is. It‚Äôs quite nice to just do something spontaneous and last minute,‚Äù she told WWD, "We‚Äôre very conscious of images and television and films being digested at a rate. This does seem to sum up something that‚Äôs going on at the moment, but I can‚Äôt quite put my finger on what. You can spend six months on a campaign and swipe right on Instagram and you get six images in less than 30 seconds."   Will we all be wearing Koizumi's extravagant gowns next season? Probably not, but that wasn't quite the point. At a time when the fashion week format seems stale and uninspired, a staircase filled with colorful, joy-sparking gowns from a young designer was a much-needed reminder that the runway can still be a magical place. Especially when you have Jacobs and Grand as your fashion fairy godparents.     If Gwendolyn Christie can make it up this staircase in this giant gown, you can make it through anything üåà Scenes from @tomokoizumi ‚Äòs magical #NYFW debut tonight ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ú® A post shared by  Lauren Alexis Fisher (@laurenalexisnyc) on Feb 8, 2019 at 4:15pm PST  @misskarenelson @bellahadid @emrata @rowanblanchard @tomokoizumi ‚ô•Ô∏èü¶ã A post shared by  Katie Eleanor Grand (@kegrand) on Feb 8, 2019 at 6:46pm PST

 The iconic VS Angel is hanging up her wings.   Adriana Lima is saying goodbye to Victoria's Secret after hitting the runway for the 18th and last time. After repping the famous lingerie brand for two decades, the 37-year-old modeling legend did her final walk this evening, ending an era for VS Angels. In honor of Lima's departure, we're looking back at her VS fashion show legacy.  Catch Lima's VSFS sendoff in full when the fashion show airs on Sunday, December 2 on ABC. Find out where to watch the broadcast here. Lima was covered in gold body chains for a Victoria's Secret fashion show during the AmfAR charity gala in Cannes, France. In a classic look from Victoria's Secret's aughts era, Lima wore a white bustier mini dress and frothy wings with metallic tassels.  Lima went bold in a a neon pink and orange look, strutting in knee-high transparent boots.  Lima crossed the glittery catwalk in low-rise undies and a matching push-up bra, with a pair of classic white wings. Adriana went green with ribbon-inspired wings, a spaghetti-strap bandeau top, and hip-hugging bottoms. Lima turned up the sparkle in white lingerie, a jeweled body chain, and a white feathered-duster layered on top. In this Candyland-inspired set, Lima donned a playful pink and yellow ensemble.  Adriana went for a black and white color scheme in these ombre wings and bejeweled bra.  The model went sporty in this neon green and orange look, complete with athletic-inspired wedges.   Lima worked this steamy black and red ensemble, complete with an abstract collar and thigh-high lace stockings with garters.  Lima went full ring leader in a colorful circus-inspired look.  Lima turned up the heat in this monochrome red ensemble, which included heart-shaped wing, arm-length gloves, a garter belt, and strappy metallic pumps. When the VS show filmed in London, Lima rocked a black lace look with sheer bustier, a tutu, and spire-like matching wings.  Lima gave us angles in this pink leotard paired with multicolored stripe feathers and lime green cage sandals.  This vibrant ensemble even had dragonflies attached to the wings. Adriana was all smiles in this super-strappy all-black look from the VS show in Shanghai. Lima takes her final walk.
 The Angels are staying home this year. It's been a busy couple of years for the Victoria Secret Angels‚Äîfrom London to Paris and last year in Shanghai they've certainly racked up some frequent flier miles.  This year's lingerie extravaganza will officially relocate back to its home in New York, where it all started in 1995. The brand announced the news today on Instagram and Twitter with several photos of their top models carrying precious feathered angel wings all over Manhattan. Sara Sampaio was spotted in Grand Central, Elsa Hosk coming out of a subway station, and Josephine Skriver hailing a taxi.  The casting call for this year's show, which also takes place in New York, just wrapped up last week, and the girls were quick to post to Instagram to confirm their placement in the most talked-about runway show in the world. There will be 18 new faces on that sparkly runway. This will also be the third year in a row that at least one official Victoria Secret Angel will be missing from the lineup. Behati Prinsloo has been out for the last two years since giving birth to two baby girls, but is likely to return this year. Candice Swanepoel missed out on the Paris show, but walked in Shanghai when she was a few months pregnant. This year Lily Aldridge will be out as she is pregnant with her second child.  Last year, the brand also faced some issues with their Shanghai spectacle due to the visa rules in China. Several girls who were promised a spot on the runway were denied visas. Mayowa Nicholas, Kate Grigorieva and even Gigi Hadid were unable to spread their wings last year but Nicholas and Hadid are confirmed to walk this year's show. 
 We break down three different looks that you can shop right now. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. In the latest episode of This Look Is Money, some of our favorite influencers show us how they stay on trend without spending thousands of dollars. Read on to see how Anthony Urbano, Margot Lee, and Candice Wu break down the more reasonably priced pieces from their wardrobe‚Äîall of which you can shop right now. Who are you wearing? How much did it cost? What favors are you calling in? Think: something old, something new, something borrowed, and something bought resale. Prepare yourself for some major fashion inspiration.   "I splurge the most on things that I can wear season after season and more than once," says Urbano, a personal style blogger. "The trend pieces [...] I don't typically spend too much on." Here's how Urbano styles some of this season's most raging trends.  He builds off his fit from some chunky sneakers, which he purchased from online retailer ASOS. With a pair of baggy navy-blue pants by H&M and a tie-dye shirt from Marshalls, Urbano looks relaxed and fashion-forward. He layers the colorful tie-dye shirt with a blue-and-white-striped button-up and a denim jacket from ASOS. For accessories, he opts for silver rings, classic Ray-Ban shades, and a necklace strap that doubles as a phone case.   "The most important thing for me when it comes to my fashion is that I'm super comfortable," Lee says. "So, that usually means I'm wearing at least one really oversized piece." The oversized piece that Lee wears in this episode is a thrifted tan blazer. Keeping in line with the neutral outerwear, she pairs the blazer with light brown wool MM6 sneakers and a white wool fanny pack.  She also opts for a classic black slip by Cynthia Rowley. A Joe Boxer watch, thick graphite hoop earrings, and a Zodiac ring make up the bulk of her accessories.   "For my personal style, I can't live without statement pieces," says Wu, a part-time stylist. "For the statement pieces I love, I definitely will spend a lot of money to invest in it because it will elevate my style." From her black Alexander McQueen loafers outfitted with hot-pink butterfly decals to her mesh top featuring comic book illustrations, Wu definitely has plenty of bold statement pieces in this look.  She balances out the bold pieces with a white blazer by Zara and a high-rise black leather skirt. Her flashy accessories include a dark green leather dog bag by Wan Hung, asymmetrical gold-wire flower earrings, and sunglasses by DIFF.

 An exclusive sale of rare and vintage bags is here for eBay's October Handbag Month. During a week of endless push notifications, here's one that won't make you want to throw your phone out a window. In honor of National Handbag Day on October 10 (yes, it's a real holiday), eBay is launching an exclusive sale of rare and vintage bags by Chanel and Louis Vuitton for the month of October.  From Louis Vuitton's iconic collections with Stephen Sprouse and Jeff Koons to vintage and limited-edition Chanel bags, eBay's sale is filled with rare finds that all feel worthy of a splurge. (There are even pieces from Louis Vuitton's collaboration with Supreme, which sold out instantly across the globe.)  The pieces are all part of eBay‚Äôs newly-launched Authenticate program, which ensures that every designer item is hand-checked for authenticity by the brand‚Äôs handbag experts‚Äîaka you don't have to worry about being catfished with a fake designer bag anymore.  Running for the month of October (unless they sell out before then), the Louis Vuitton and Chanel bag sales each feature over 100 styles of bags with prices starting out at $260 for wallets and ranging up into the thousands. If there was ever a time to treat yourself, it's now.
 The fashion giant is struggling. Despite high-profile collaborations with both Erdem and Nicki Minaj last fall, H&M admitted that it is sitting on a stockpile of $4.3 billion worth of unsold dresses, accessories, and other clothing and has seen a 62 percent drop in profits in the three months through February of this year, The New York Times reports. While this is bad news for the Swedish retailer, which also owns Cos and & Other Stories, it‚Äôs great news for everyone else since H&M plans to slash prices in the upcoming months to get rid of the unsold stock to fix the problem. But some of that inventory includes months-old Halloween costumes and Christmas sweaters, according to the Washington Post.  The massive pile of unsold clothing‚Äîa 7 percent increase in the past year‚Äîis just one example of how the fashion giant has been unable to keep up in a world where more shoppers are skipping stores and heading online to buy clothes instead. In addition to cutting prices, H&M also plans to cut back on opening new stores and focus their efforts on expanding their online business by 25 percent this year.  However, that might not be enough to fix the problem and financial analysts aren‚Äôt optimistic about the company. In fact, one even called H&M ‚Äúa slow-motion wreck‚Äù after seeing the company‚Äôs first quarter results, according to The New York Times. Part of the problem is that the millennial consumer base is starting to opt for well-made clothes rather than cheap "throwaway products," Milton Pedraza, CEO of New York-based market research firm Luxury Institute, told the Washington Post. They're more interested in "classic and quality, neither of which H&M has been able to deliver." But for those who are still loyal to H&M, keep an eye out for massive sales in the upcoming months.
 Save your all-black ensembles for next year. This season is all about COLOR.  As the temperatures start to drop, we're quick to embrace a wardrobe full of neutrals, from camels and browns to grays and blacks. But this fall, you may want to trade in your trusted noir turtlenecks and tan coats for a bold, bright, and totally unexpected color palette.  If the fall 2019 runways were any indication, the season's standard sea of buttery neutrals and monochromatic darks is about to get infused with shades of shocking pink, purple, orange, neon yellow, and fashion's favorite new color: pistachio green. Liven up your wardrobe with these fall color trends that are actually quite groundbreaking.  After seasons of asking what the next millennial pink is, we finally have an answer: pistachio green. Popping up on several fall 2019 runways, the color quickly began taking over Instagram and the street style scene. The soft hue feels fresh, especially for the fall/winter season, and looks good in both apparel and accessory forms.  Clockwise from top left: Sally LaPointe, Jil Sander, Ryan Roche, Marc Jacobs  Work the hue into your fall wardrobe with a midi skirt that's easy to style with boots, jackets, and sweaters.¬† For a pop of the color, try Staud's buzzy new It bag shape that lends a little early 2000s nostalgia.¬† Whether worn with black or white boots, this soft floral frock is unexpected for fall but guaranteed to become your go-to.¬† Purple has long been a polarizing color among the fashion set, but it's staging a triumphant comeback in all shades this season. From pastel lilacs to deep violets and all that's in between, purple hit the fall 2019 runways in dress, coat, sweater, and even hat form. For a softer take on the trend, opt for a shade of lavender or lilac.  Clockwise from top left: Lanvin, Cushnie, Sally LaPointe, Tom Ford A trench coat that's anything but basic. Bring a little bit of color into your fall wardrobe with this lavender jacket that'll shield you from the rain and look extra chic when layered with all your chunky knit sweaters.¬† Embrace turtleneck season in a fresh new hue. Wear this cropped sweater with high-waisted jeans on the weekend and your favorite midi skirt or trousers for the office.¬† Add a pair of knee-high boots and you've got an instantly chic (and effortless) look.¬† The great Elle Woods once declared that anyone who said orange was the new pink was "seriously disturbed."  But contrary to her passionate hot take, there's room for both orange and pink this season. Brands like Carolina Herrera and Staud sent head-to-toe orange looks down the runway, proving the color is better when bolder. And Sies Marjan paired the bright hue with an equally bright pink, bringing forth the ultimate unexpected fall color palette.  Clockwise from left: Sies Marjan, Staud, Carolina Herrera Continuing in our '90s nostalgia, we've still got cardigan fever this season. Try the look in a bright orange for a fresh take on the wardrobe classic.¬† This splurge-worthy orange coat will have you standing out among a sea of all-black outerwear.¬† There's nothing more effortless than an easy-to-throw-on sweaterdress. Try it in this '70s-inspired burnt orange that will act as a neutral in your closet.¬† We may be millennial pink-ed out, but there's plenty of room for bright, hot pink in our closets. Liven up your go-to fall color palette of blacks, browns, and grays with a shade of shocking pink that'll wake you up on the chilliest of fall days. Take note from Jacquemus and try the look in coat form or go the Chanel route and try it out in a suit.  Clockwise from top left: Jacquemus, Molly Goddard, Chanel, Valentino  Your work wardrobe needs to have a little fun too. This hot pink blazer is boardroom or bust.¬† Because you can never have enough midi slip skirts, add a hot pink style to your rotation. Pair it with a chunky knit sweater for a fresh fall look.¬† Black pants are cool, but have you ever tried a pair of hot pink trousers instead? These offer an instant LEWK that will have you turning heads for all the right reasons.¬† Surprising us all, neons popped up on countless fall 2019 runways, from New York to Milan to Paris. Whether you go for jacket, sweater, or dress form, this is one way to stand out in all of winter's storms.   Clockwise from top left: Versace, Sies Marjan, Nina Ricci, Marine Serre Style this oversized neon button-down with bike shorts for a cool, off-duty weekend look or trousers for your nine-to-five.¬† Combining not one, not two, but three fall trends in one: This neon python belt bag will instantly add an extra layer of cool to any look in your closet. Yes, you need a pair of neon statement-making pants in your life. Add a white tee and pumps, and you're good to go.¬†
 Inside the pink and lilac world of Staud... Sarah Staudinger, founder of Staud, has a new New York outpost for her eponymous brand. With vintage Italian chairs, marble accoutrement and enough pink and lavender to float away on, the interiors are Insta-bait at its finest. The interiors are all self-done, "Mainly because it's fun and when you do it yourself, it creates an intimacy with whoever visits," the designer explains. "That can be challenging when it's just someone else's project." Staud's bucket bags have become retail gold for the brand, but there's a whole line of retro-inspired cool-girl clothes to back them up. BAZAAR.com stopped by the newly-debuted SoHo showroom while Staudinger was showing her fun new Fall collection straight out of "Clueless" to editors and buyers. Go inside the sweeping space and see what's next for this burgeoning brand. Tell me about the inspiration for the design of the space? The inspo came primarily from two of our artist friends, Luckey Remington and Carly Jo Morgan. Luckey makes these beautiful, bold sculptural works that we've collected over the years. We asked him to reinterpret a few of his pieces as product displays, and we couldn't have been happier with the outcome. Carly most recently has been creating furniture in pink terrazzo. We commissioned a super low coffee table to go with two '70s vintage b&b; itlaia chairs we've had sitting in storage forever. It was great to be finally able to use them.

We also purchased online from Spartan Shop. A close up of the marble that Pinterest pages are made for... Why did you want to open a New York showroom now? We did two seasons out of the Bowery Hotel, which was great. Fortunately, our wholesale business has expanded enough to create the need for a full time NYC showroom that also serves as an office for our director of sales who is based on the East Coast.  In addition to its own e-commerce site, Staud is also available at Net-a-Porter, Matches Fashion and more.  You plan to change up the showroom seasonally. How and why are you taking that approach? You want the vibe of the space to reflect the vibe of that season's collection. It could be as simple as all new plants and flowers, switching up a few area rugs, or a new hue of paint color.  Which designers do you gravitate towards outside of your own label? The Row and Ganni. How do you keep Staud a sustainable label? We don‚Äôt over cut items, every piece is made with mindfulness, and we do not use fur. Staud's unofficial mascot... You don‚Äôt do runway shows; what do you think is the best way to get your brand message out to your customers? Through our content. We put a lot of time into creating interesting and meaningful imagery. It‚Äôs one of the most important aspects of our brand. All those cult bags all in a row... Who is the Staud girl to you? The Staud girl to me is me. It‚Äôs the girl who wants to feel stylish and unique without having to spend a fortune. She likes to mix high and lows and is a smart shopper.

 The ads star the names of Kaia Gerber, Taraji P. Henson, and Behati Prinsloo‚Äîbut not the faces.  For his Spring 2018 campaign, Alexander Wang cast some big names: Kaia Gerber, Zo√´ Kravitz, Taraji P. Henson, Behati Prinsloo, and more‚Äîbut not their faces.  The brand's spring ads forgo the traditional route of models wearing the new collection and instead feature flat images of products selected by the campaign stars. Each of Wang's muses selected a piece from the spring range, wore it in real life, then shared a quote about where they wore it. "Drinking a Fatburger chocolate shake," Prinsloo's states (which, same).   Kravitz, on the other hand, selected a deconstructed t-shirt dress that she plans to wear "by the fire" with her man.  In a statement from the brand, Wang offered more of an insight into the inspiration behind the campaign: Gerber selected two objects: a leather biker bustier she wore to "a birthday with a tight-knit crew" (obviously Sweet 16 parties have changed since my time) and a pair of hung up heels for an "impromptu after party on the beach in Malibu." Henson, meanwhile, chose a men's blazer she wore to one of her movie premieres.  See the full campaign now at AlexanderWang.com and shop the collection here. 
 Chanel and Versace are also slated to show runways in New York this December.   The Europeans are coming for New York. Following news that both Chanel and Versace are staging shows in New York this December, Louis Vuitton has announced plans to bring its Cruise 2020 runway to the Big Apple this spring. After several seasons of American designers, including Altuzarra and Rodarte, giving up their New York Fashion Week spots for venues in Paris, it appears European designers are ready to trade places. Louis Vuitton's creative director Nicolas Ghesqui√®re announced the brand's news on Instagram, revealing its next traveling Cruise show would be held in New York on May 8, 2019.  The French fashion house has previously staged its globe-trotting Cruise collections in the French Riviera, Kyoto, and Rio de Janeiro. Each runway has been held in a stunning location from a vantage point overlooking the Shigaraki Mountains in Japan to the Niter√≥i Contemporary Art Museum in Rio de Janeiro‚Äîmaking for spectacular backdrops for its cruise collections. It's unclear where exactly in New York the brand will unveil its Cruise 2020 collection.  Vuitton's American-held runway will come on the heels of Chanel's Metiers d'Art Pre-Fall 2019 show and Versace's Pre-Fall 2019 show, both of which will take place in New York this December. Chanel is slated to present its first New York-based runway in over a decade on December 4 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, while Versace will show its first ever pre-fall collection on December 2, the late Gianni Versace's birthday. 
 The philosopher-king of cashmere looks back on four decades of Italian ingenuity.  In the rolling hills of Umbria, Italy, Brunello Cucinelli has built his city upon a hill‚Äîliterally. The 65-year-old Italian designer with a penchant for quoting Socrates and Saint Benedict has been painstakingly restoring a medieval village called Solomeo, all the while transforming a quiet rural community into a thriving manufacturing center. For more than two decades, a 14th-century castlecum- factory was the unlikely provenance of gorgeous cashmere separates now carried at more than 126 Brunello Cucinelli stores around the world. In this textile utopia‚Äîwhere employees are paid 20 percent above the national average‚ÄîCucinelli, the son of a cement factory worker, has rebuilt squares, repaved streets, and added a theater and a library.   ‚ÄúMy main source of inspiration was the teary eyes of my father when he used to be humiliated and offended at work,‚Äù he says.Now Cucinelli is setting his sights beyond the walls of SoloBmeo‚Äôs honey-colored castle. Due to the brand‚Äôs exponential growth, the company headquarters was moved permanently in 2010 to the valley below the village. ‚ÄúThis area wasn‚Äôt so gracious,‚Äù Cucinelli says of land that had been filled with industrial buildings and warehouses. ‚ÄúSo we decided to embellish it.‚Äù Never content to do anything by half measures, Cucinelli embarked on an ever-so-modestly titled ‚ÄúProject for Beauty,‚Äù to be completed this fall. The headquarters will be encircled by a large garden, and an agricultural park will feature fruit orchards, golden fields of wheat and silvery expanses of alfalfa, a maze-shaped vineyard, a winery, and an olive grove with the trees planted in a circle to represent the shape of the world. But perhaps the pi√®ce de r√©sistance is the monument A Tribute to Human Dignity, which was built from the same marble used by Michelangelo. Says Cucinelli, ‚ÄúI think it will still be standing in a thousand years.‚Äù

 Guests and models were ankle-deep in a sea of popcorn.  Last night, Raf Simons presented his Fall 2018 collection for Calvin Klein on a massive sea of popcorn at the former American Stock Exchange building. Both the show's attendees (including an ultra star-studded front row) and the lineup of models walked ankle-deep in popcorn, but it was by no means a happy-go-lucky movie night theme.   Raf Simons has filled the entire floor of the pjs American Stock Exchange with popcorn for his @CalvinKlein show #NYFW pic.twitter.com/FGkuZauyjH  For his second season at Calvin Klein, Simons took a deeper (and darker) dive into the state of America. In his show notes, Simons described the U.S. with 50 keywords which included phrases like "firefighter," "freedom" and "civil" immediately followed by "war." The set was comprised of three run-down and seemingly burned barns that were covered in artwork by Andy Warhol. The sea of popcorn, as Fashionista points out, was perhaps meant to symbolize burned-down cornfields.

The dystopian-inspired collection also included hazmat boots and gloves, prairie dresses, Western shirts and Mylar-inspired pieces channeling the look of astronauts. It was its own quilted patchwork of American history.   Calvin Klein by Raf Simons üß°üß°üß°üß° ‚Äî@nicolefritton A post shared by  Harper's BAZAAR (@harpersbazaarus) on Feb 13, 2018 at 8:44pm PST As if the set and collection didn't offer up enough clues to the tone of the show, Simon & Garfunkel‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Sound of Silence" served as the soundtrack as models walked the popcorn-filled runway. The show then ended to a snippet of David Bowie's "This Is Not America."  Offsetting the dark, thought-provoking theme of the show, however, was the bright and star-studded front row. Black Panther's Lupita Nyong'o and Michael B. Jordan sat next to each other while Big Little Lies stars Nicole Kidman and Laura Dern sat alongside Margot Robbie. Calvin Klein campaign stars A$AP Rocky and Millie Bobby Brown were also in attendance, adorably taking videos while sitting next to each other. 
 A look at what Fall 2017 has in store...  The entire style story for the season... Designers are inarguably mad about plaid‚Äîutilizing the distinctive Savile Row-worthy fabrication on everything from coats to suiting.

 Kim says no, but some screenshot receipts suggest otherwise. Over the weekend, Kim Kardashian stepped out in an insanely cut-out vintage dress from Thierry Mugler's 1998 archives. Less than 24 hours later, Fashion Nova posted an identical copy of the dress retailing for $50. Fast fashion is fast, but is it really that fast? Eagle-eyed fashion watchdogs behind the popular Instagram account Diet Prada were first to call out the suspiciously fast timing. The account then came in hot with some screenshot receipts suggesting Kardashian may have leaked her borrowed designer look to Fashion Nova before wearing it.  According to a screenshot captured from Fashion Nova model Yodit Yemane's Instagram account, photo shoot images of the site's Mugler knockoff were dated February 14, four days before Kim wore the gown in public. Moreover, the original file name of the photos was labeled "Kim dress," though the product name was later dubbed "Winning Beauty Cut Out Gown‚Äù on the site.  Diet Prada told BAZAAR.com it was first tipped off to the suspicious activity when all Kylie Jenner's 21st birthday party looks were copied on Fashion Nova within hours of Jenner stepping out. A later Instagram caption from Kim asking "fast fashion brands, can you please wait until I wear this in real life before you knock it off?" added fuel to the fire, "Her [Kim's] glib attitude towards Missguided in her caption for the gold Yeezy dress seemed fishy...especially considering it‚Äôs a knockoff of her husband‚Äôs work and he apparently wrote her a $1,000,000 check to turn down a fast fashion collab," Diet Prada said.  After the allegations of peddling her looks to Fashion Nova, Kim took to Twitter to defend herself, putting the onus on fast fashion companies. In a string of tweets, she called the knockoffs "devastating" and concluded by saying, "I don‚Äôt have any relationships with these sites. I‚Äôm not leaking my looks to anyone, and I don‚Äôt support what these companies are doing."  It‚Äôs devastating to see these fashion companies rip off designs that have taken the blood, sweat and tears of true designers who have put their all into their own original ideas. I‚Äôve watched these companies profit off my husband‚Äôs work for years and now that it‚Äôs also affecting designers who have been so generous to give me access to their beautiful works, I can no longer sit silent. Only two days ago, I was privileged enough to wear a one-of-a-kind vintage Mugler dress and in less than 24 hours it was knocked off and thrown up on a site - but it's not for sale. You have to sign up for a waitlist because the dress hasn‚Äôt even been made to sell yet. My relationships with designers are very important to me. It's taken me over a decade to build them and I have a huge amount of respect for the amount of work that they put into bringing their ideas to life. Could sites like Fashion Nova and Missguided just be extremely fast in shooting their replicas? Diet Prada tells BAZAAR.com: "It‚Äôs possible, but the date stamp on the file names of the images from the shoot are telling.  Both Kris and Kylie Jenner have also already officially partnered with Fashion Nova, so the family connection is there."   If Kim is secretly leaking her designer outfits to fast fashion sites ahead of time, are there legal implications? It's complicated, but Julie Zerbo, attorney and founder of The Fashion Law, says it's technically legal, "I don't know of any embargo on the imagery of borrowed or lent designer looks, so I don't think there would be a contract issue."  It could, however, be an issue if Kim does in fact have a secret deal with Fashion Nova or Missguided. "If there is a partnership of some kind, then that would need to be disclosed by both the celebrity endorser and the brand itself,‚Äù Zerbo explains.  Another potential red flag: "What might be an issue is if Kim and Fashion Nova or Misguided are working together to create these looks in connection with her posting something on Instagram, like ‚Äòfast fashion companies please don‚Äôt copy this look‚Äô and mentioning a specific one and then that specific one turning around and promoting it on Instagram. That is very likely one of the 'material connections' that the Federal Trade Commission would be hoping to see disclosed for the benefit of consumers,‚Äù Zerbo adds.  Strangely enough, Missguided's Instagram post, doing exactly what Zerbo describes, was later deleted from its page after copying Kim's gold Yeezy dress.  Ultimately, one has to ask why Kim, who has worked hard to be taken seriously in the fashion world, would jeopardize her designer connections for the sake of a Fashion Nova partnership? Diet Prada speculates that because "Kim is the queen of monetizing her physical appearance, it makes sense that the rewards of a fast fashion partnership would outweigh the risk. In this case, she probably got the dress from an archival fashion dealer and thought it was fair game as opposed to knocking off a contemporary designer who created something custom for her, or is currently selling on the market.  I think she may have underestimated how beloved Thierry Mugler‚Äôs work is." 
 Channel your inner Joey Tribbiani. The internet is abuzz over Balenciaga's new jacket, which features seven layers and is retailing for $9,000 on Matches Fashion. The oversized coat consists of  a "combination of plaid shirts, jersey hoodies, and technical fleeces," according to its official description. It's bound to keep you warm in the winter.    Balenciaga coat, $9,000, matchesfashion.com. Coming soon.  SHOP The outerwear piece is part of Balenciaga's Fall 2018 collection and debuted on the runways during Paris Fashion Week in March. The range, helmed by creative director Demna Gvasalia, included different variations of the layered parka, including iterations with leopard prints and color-block trench coats for women.  It didn't take long for the Internet to troll the jacket. People promptly made comparisons to Joey wearing all of Chandler's clothes in Friends‚Äîand the similarities are actually quite uncanny.

I feel like these are a cry for help pic.twitter.com/1F4P9W4Ino This isn't the first time Balenciaga's outerwear have caused a viral craze. Its Fall 2017 men's collection caught attention with jackets and other pieces emblazoned with a logo inspired by Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign. Last year, its parkas (only one layer this time) were nearly ubiquitous on the street style scene, spotted on everyone from the fashion set to stylish rappers like A$AP Rocky.  It looks like the Joey Tribbiani-esque coat is the latest addition to the list. But who will be brave enough to actually wear it (and, well, buy it) this winter? Apparently, the men's collection also includes a layered parka with a hot pink feathered outer coat. We can't wait until this one hits retail.
 The 96-year-old style star talks clear boots, sneakers and Crocs in a new profile with Footwear News.  At 96 years old, Iris Apfel reigns as fashion's most famous geriatric style icon‚Äîand she isn't slowing down anytime soon. Apfel covers the latest issue of Footwear News, where she shares her signature wit while discussing her accessory collection for HSN, the shoe trends she finds "revolting" and how social media is "the worst thing to happen to young people."  In a video with Footwear News, Apfel doesn't hold back while critiquing shoe trends from clear boots to the sneaker takeover to Crocs ("Why should you wear rubber shoes?" she wisely asks).  After admitting that she would actually try the clear boot trend, the 96-year-old also discusses the importance of affordable fashion. Apfel is proud of the accessibility of her accessory collection for HSN, Rara Avis, which offers unique pieces at an affordable price point (with prices ranging mostly from $30 - $100). Dropping more nuggets of wisdom, Apfel points out, "There‚Äôs no trick in making a gorgeous garment that costs thousands of dollars, but who can afford those things unless you have a built-in sugar daddy? And they ain‚Äôt easy to find." Preach.  As for how she feels about the digital age affecting style? She has a neutral stance on online shopping, ‚ÄúI buy very little online. But you can‚Äôt go by me‚Äîtechnologically, I live in the late 17th century. When people ask if they can send me an email, I say, ‚ÄòNo, darling, send me a pigeon.‚Äô‚Äù But when it comes to your Instagrams, tweets and Facebook posts? Apfel feels very strongly against what social media has done: "It‚Äôs probably the worst thing that could happen to young people these days. They all live vicariously through somebody else. Besides, what business is it of anybody‚Äôs what you had for lunch or where you‚Äôre going or who you‚Äôre sleeping with? None.‚Äù Read Apfel's full profile in the new issue of Footwear News at footwearnews.com.   
 Four easy tips for building the perfect casual outfit. T he thing about looking effortless is that it always seems to require actual effort. The trick is perfecting a few simple things that make it easy to put together a stylish look. Look no further than the Europeans for proof: The French girl has her striped boat tops and ballet flats, and the Italian girl has her perfectly tailored trousers and loafers (worn without socks, of course). If you're in need of some style inspiration this season, see the below tips for advice on how to nail the perfect weekend outfit‚Äîwhether you're heading to the park, going to brunch, or stopping by the farmer's market. 
  Keep It Simple  Sometimes, the most fashion-forward looks are the easiest ones to put together, like a deliciously cozy sweater paired with a fitted leather trench. Think of it as a formula: sweater + pants + great coat = fabulous outfit. If you're feeling experimental, look for a coat in a brighter hue. 
  Choose Oversized Silhouettes A cropped leather jacket is a wardrobe staple, but switch it up a bit by investing in a boxy, oversized silhouette. Pair it with white jeans and a chunky sweater, and the result is super chic and cool.  
  Stick to All Black  When in doubt, stick with a single color from head to toe. Keep an eye out for the details: This outfit works because the pants are tailored just above the ankle, and the loafers are worn without socks. 
   Invest in a Trench The trench coat is included on every "must buy" list for a reason: It'll never go out of style and it can be worn practically anywhere. Whether you throw it on over a dress or wear it with jeans and a turtleneck, it's the easiest way to look stylish on any given weekend. Plus, you never know who you'll run into.

 Yup, she has a "purse closet." Most of us aspire to get our hands on at least one Herm√®s Birkin bag in our lifetime, but Kylie Jenner already has nearly an entire closet-full. The 20-year-old beauty mogul shared a look at her newly-renovated purse closet (yup, apparently those exist) on Snapchat today, and we can't believe our eyes.  Her Birkin collection takes up two rows of shelves on at least two of the walls in Jenner's mirror-lined closet. And then there's her Chanel quilted backpacks, Louis Vuitton totes, Supreme fanny packs, Gucci bags, and more. She gave us a closeup of a row of the pricey purses, which included iterations in burnt orange suede, millennial pink, maroon, tan, and brown leather.  It turns out the spotted one was her newest addition to the lineup. "Welcome," she wrote on a photo of the newly-unboxed bag. She also featured these adorable patent leather Louis Vuitton minis, to pique our jealousy even more. Kylie isn't the only Birkin-lover in her family. Her mother Kris Jenner famously has a whole closet dedicated to the luxury Herm√®s bag, with a custom light-up sign that says: "Need Money for Birkin." Kylie also featured the collection on her Snapchat last summer. We wonder if Drake's stash looks anything like this.

 "Celebrate your unique beauty today (& everyday)!"  Since competing on America's Next Top Model, Winnie Harlow has made a name for herself in the fashion world. Along with walking countless runways, nabbing campaigns for Diesel, Desigual and Nike, and making an appearance in Beyonc√©'s Lemonade, the model has also been outspoken about her vitiligo, a condition that causes the loss of skin color in patches.  Continuing in promoting body-positivity, Harlow took to Instagram today to share a naked selfie celebrating her skin. Posing in nothing but a thong and silver hoop earrings, she shared an empowering message, "the real difference isn't my skin. It's the fact that I don't find my beauty in the opinions of others. I'm beautiful because I know it. Celebrate Your unique beauty today (& everyday)!" The naked photo is just the latest in Harlow's outspoken body-positive activism. Earlier this month, the 23-year-old model spoke to BAZAAR UK about her new Burt's Bees beauty campaign saying, "Humans, like flowers, come in so many ranges; colors, heights and sizes, for example. None of those differences makes one flower or human better or more beautiful. It's the differences that make us all beautiful."
 Meet Zofia Chylak‚Äîthe designer behind the craze.  Fact: It's almost as hard to get a Chylak bag as it is to get an H√©rmes Birkin. The Polish-based brand has taken Instagram by storm, becoming an overnight favorite amongst influencers, It-girls, and basically anyone looking for a chic, well-made bag that won't break your budget.  We spoke with Polish native Zofia Chylak on the eve of her new collection debut to discover how she reached It-bag stardom, and what it feels like to have thousands of girls clamoring to buy her designs. When you first launched the brand, did you have any idea it would become this big and have such a cult following? Thank you, I was certainly not expecting this! I‚Äôm shocked every time I receive an update on the figure. Currently it‚Äôs over 15 000 so it‚Äôs really overwhelming.  We are doing our best to meet the demand but we don‚Äôt want to compromise on the quality. Some models sell out in 5 minutes. People think this is a clever business idea, but the truth is it just happened naturally. We‚Äôve also had to start putting them online later in the day so that the US audience get a chance when the new stock arrives‚Ä¶    Shoulder Bag ‚ÄúGlossy Brown Crocodile‚Äù is back in stock and available now online at www.chylak.com A post shared by  CHYLAK (@chylak.bags) on Feb 21, 2019 at 2:36am PST  Chylak has been in operation since 2014. What do you attribute to its recent explosion? Did you have a specific strategy or did it happen organically? Launching the brand in Poland allowed us to build a local following, and organically grow and gradually expand our product line. We started selling directly to consumer, and focused on online sales. I had a lot of support from the Polish press and that gave me confidence. Working with a London-based PR agency helped to get the brand recognized internationally. Last year was really exciting for us, a few months after some of the international girls became fans of the brand and started wearing Chylak, we received a call from Net-A-Porter who wanted to work with us. I think having a following definitely helped in terms of being recognized by key stockists and press internationally.  Can you tell me more about your drops? For example, how often do you release more bags and how frequently is that? Even though I hear from people that ‚Äòeverything is sold out all time‚Äô there‚Äôs a new drop every few days (usually we are restocking our current bestsellers). We have more than 60 products and we cannot produce and release all of them at the same time, so usually you have to wait one or two months to stock certain models. At the moment, we are releasing new collections four times a year. You interned at Proenza Schouler. What was the most important thing that you learned there? It was an amazing time, for me it was a great opportunity to see how such big brands look from the inside. In Poland I would never have such an opportunity.  I‚Äôve always been an observer, so I‚Äôm very good at learning just by watching, I‚Äôm very focused on details. I remember that I was impressed with Jack and Lazaro, the designers, the way they work with fabrics, the way they would spend all days with pattern makers, cutting by themselves, working hand in hand with interns. Never making us feel as we were somehow less important. Proenza Schouler was working with really amazing pattern making atelier - Nicolas Caito - everyone there had an amazing portfolio and they all worked for biggest French fashion houses like Dior and Chanel, I was interning also with them, watching them making clothes, sewing by hand, it was really an amazing experience. So many amazing new brands are coming out of Europe from places like Poland and Georgia. Why do you think these countries are offering products that are more affordable and better made than the US? I‚Äôm really glad that this is happening, and every excited to see new countries emerging on the fashion map now. I think it‚Äôs primarily because of the internet and social media. It‚Äôs now easier than ever to find new exciting brands. Fashion loves fresh, new things. I remember a few years ago my friends were asking me if I was sure that I wanted to write  ‚Äòmade in Poland‚Äô on every bag I make. It was unusual at that time but I loved Poland and I felt that it‚Äôs time for us to be proud of it. Now when I‚Äôm talking to clients and buyers, they love it. Price is for sure another reason. From the beginning I wanted my accessories to be elegant and timeless but affordable and accessible. Your bags are that perfect mix of classic and on trend. What inspired your shapes and silhouettes? Any specific references? That‚Äôs exactly the mix I was hoping to be able to achieve while designing. I‚Äôm very sentimental, I look back a lot. I was studying history of art, and since I was a child I felt I would fit perfectly to the world of 18th or 19th century. But on the other hand I know that we‚Äôre here now and wearing crinoline dresses would be ridiculous. So that‚Äôs where you need to look for something in between and combine. I want my bags to be as elegant as my grandmother in 1935 and as fresh as what you can see on the streets of Paris and New York during fashion week.  Alice Barbier @jaimetoutcheztoi was spotted yesterday during Paris Fashion Week with our Saddle Bag ‚ÄúGlossy Brown Crocodile‚Äù  Photo @asiatypek A post shared by  CHYLAK (@chylak.bags) on Jan 16, 2019 at 12:51am PST Social media (and Instagram in particular) has had a huge impact on your business. How do you feel about the social media landscape, and managing the huge amount of work that goes with it? Instagram is my favorite I must say. Such a powerful platform right now. We really work hard to build a consistent brand aesthetics through photos that we post, and to connect with our followers. We all know that it‚Äôs not only about product now it‚Äôs about creating a beautiful, interesting world of the brand. We invest in working with talented photographers like Asia Typek, her street style photos are one of the most characteristic part of our instagram identity. 
 Reed Krakoff brings a luxurious sense of ease to his first high jewelry collection for Tiffany & Co. On Reed Krakoff‚Äôs first day on the job as Tiffany & Co.‚Äôs chief artistic officer in February 2017, he was given coffee in a paper cup the color of the store‚Äôs signature blue box, with the company‚Äôs name in black on the front. He loved it, took a picture of it. There was ‚Äúthis utilitarian thing,‚Äù he recalls, ‚Äúthat was somehow romantic, being Tiffany Blue‚Äîperfectly useful but not plain.‚Äù Now, a year later, Tiffany is selling a bone china version of that paper cup‚Äîsame shape, same blue, the name in black‚Äîalong with silver plates crimped like standard-issue paper ones. He sees these as current examples of the irreverence and wit that inform some of his favorite products from the archives, like the sterling silver pillbox in the shape of a Chinese takeout container that Tiffany first sold back in the 1980s. The new objects are in many ways emblematic of Krakoff‚Äôs philosophy of ‚Äúeveryday luxury,‚Äù Tiffany items that are intended to be used and worn on a daily basis, as opposed to precious objects to be reserved for special occasions. Sitting in a library down the hall from his office at the 181-year-old company‚Äôs Manhattan headquarters, in a building facing Madison Square Park, Krakoff is doing one of the things he does best: talking about luxury. Tall with close-cut salt-and-pepper hair, he is dressed in his workweek uniform of jeans, a Turnbull & Asser shirt‚Äîtoday‚Äôs is a navy-and-white gingham check‚Äîand black oxfords, no socks. Black eyeglasses give him the slightly bookish air of a design nerd, an impression reinforced by the many references to objects, furniture, fashion, films, and paintings he weaves into the conversation. He speaks softly, in a low voice, and quickly, as if he were propelled by his ideas.  ‚ÄúI was determined not to make it formal,‚Äù Krakoff says of Paper Flowers, his first high jewelry collection for Tiffany. ‚ÄúThis has become a mantra of mine, the idea that formality doesn‚Äôt equal luxury.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThis has become a mantra of mine, the idea that formality doesn‚Äôt equal luxury.‚Äù The point of departure was a watercolor rendering of an iris, dated 1881 and found in the company archives; iris, as it happens, is the central note of the Tiffany fragrance launched in September. But Krakoff wasn‚Äôt looking for a literal representation. Instead, he says, he wanted to capture ‚Äúthe poetic idea of flowers.‚Äù He began making cutout shapes, crafting petals out of paper, and translating them into metal, riveting the petals together‚Äî‚Äúcombining nature and an artisanal hand,‚Äù he says. Then came the coloration: blue and purple, from sapphires and tanzanite, a gemstone that Tiffany introduced to the world in 1968; and white and yellow, from the diamonds for which the company is famous. For contrast, the items incorporate mirror-polished pieces of platinum, which, Krakoff says, ‚Äúpeople aren‚Äôt used to seeing because typically everything is pav√©ed and as diamond-encrusted as possible.‚Äù The result, he says, is ‚Äúa tension between industrial and organic, between masculine and feminine.‚Äù     He is especially proud of the fact that the new collection runs the gamut from a bib necklace set with 68 carats of diamonds to openwork cocktail rings and pendants to wear with an evening gown or jeans and a T-shirt, with prices to match‚Äîunlike most high jewelry collections, positioned firmly in the stratosphere. Contrary to the age-old formula, in which ideas are born and expressed in their purest form at the top of the market and filter down into less expensive versions, Paper Flowers was conceived somewhere in the middle and then extended in both directions. The goal was to ‚Äúrecontextualize high jewelry in a more wearable, authentic way,‚Äù says Krakoff. ‚ÄúIt felt like a better approach, as opposed to starting with high jewelry, which is a little paralyzing. Too often there‚Äôs a heaviness to the thinking behind it.‚Äù  As Krakoff talks about Tiffany, certain words keep recurring. ‚ÄúDesire‚Äù is one, Tiffany being in the business of ‚Äúcreating things that people fall in love with,‚Äù he says. This is, to his mind, one of the company‚Äôs chief responsibilities. ‚ÄúDream‚Äù is another, as in ‚Äúa place to dream‚Äù‚Äîhis early impression of the store when, as a teenager accompanying his mother on a trip to New York from their home in suburban Connecticut, they stopped off at Tiffany‚Äôs fourth floor to look at table settings created by Vladimir Kagan, Angelo Donghia, and other famous designers of the time. Krakoff considers himself a custodian of Tiffany‚Äôs illustrious tradition, the latest in a brief line that reaches all the way back to the Art Nouveau master Louis Comfort Tiffany, acclaimed for his stained glass lamps and windows, a son of the store‚Äôs founder and Tiffany‚Äôs first official design director. Among Krakoff‚Äôs more recent predecessors was John Loring, Tiffany‚Äôs revered design director emeritus who retired in 2009 after holding the position for three decades. During his tenure, Loring authored 21 books for Tiffany, educating consumers about diamonds, pearls, and watches; dispensing advice on setting a table, throwing a party, planning a wedding; and defining good taste by his example. It was, Krakoff says, ‚Äúa more prescriptive time. I think people were interested in being informed and guided. Today it‚Äôs entirely different. It‚Äôs very much about my version of this brand‚Äîit‚Äôs my interpretation.‚Äù He feels ‚Äúa real responsibility to deliver something that‚Äôs worthy,‚Äù creating products showcased on a virtual stage vying 24-7 for the limited attention of a global audience. ‚ÄúThe most American thing you can say about design is that form follows function.‚Äù     
 
 Aptly called, "QUEEN."  As if being one of the greatest athletes of all time wasn't enough, Serena Williams has also cemented her status as one of the greatest dressed athletes of all time. So for her big return to the US Open, where she'll compete for her 24th Grand Slam, it's only fitting that the tennis icon wear something special.  Enter Off-White designer and artistic director of Louis Vuitton Men's, Virgil Abloh, who joined forces with Nike to design a collection for Williams to wear for the occasion. Aptly called "QUEEN," the Virgil Abloh x Nike collection for Serena includes tennis dresses, sparkling sneakers, and Abloh's signature quotation graphics reading "LOGO" and "SERENA."   "With Serena, we have one of our generation's most powerful, inspiring athletes as the muse," Abloh said in a statement from the brand, "I was trying to embody her spirit and bring something compelling and fresh to tennis." Taking Serena's love for both dance and tennis, the ballerina-inspired collection includes a one-shouldered dress complete with a tutu. And if anyone can win a match while wearing a tutu, it's Serena Williams.  "What I love about tennis is the gracefulness. It's an aggressive and powerful game, but it takes touch and finesse," Abloh said, ‚ÄúSo the dress is feminine, but combines her aggression. It's partially revealing. It's asymmetrical. It has a sort of ballerina-esque silhouette to symbolize her grace. It's not about bells and whistles and tricks. It's just about it living on the body, and expressing Serena‚Äôs spirit with each swing of the racket." The collection also includes a sleek bomber jacket that can be worn both on and off the court, a bag, the NikeCourt Flare 2, and limited editions of The 10: Nike Air Max 97 and The 10: Nike Blazer Mid SW. Not only will the tennis champion wear the pieces for her return to the US Open, it will also be produced as a limited-edition capsule collection for fans to shop. Ranging from $130 - $900, the items will officially be available to shop online and in select Nike stores once Williams debuts them on the court in the coming weeks. 
 See the fashion-forward shoes that will solve all of your wardrobe dilemmas, over and over again... Shoes are love stories just waiting to be told. With seemingly endless options each season, it can be easy to fall into trend-driven styles that need to be swapped out in mere months. Consider the long game and opt in on the shoes you'll wear season after season, year after year. Just get a good cobbler in your repertoire and you're good to go.  A style so forever, we'd be shocked if it wasn't already in your closet. Brittany Xavier proves that this classic can look super modern with the addition of a sheer ankle sock.  ¬† The easy slide sandal may sound like a summer-only mainstay, but this fashion show-goer proves it can find its way into fall and spring with the addition of  a chic suit. Whether you opt for an Hermes sandal or something flashier, the idea remains the same. While Bottega Veneta's ankle strap heel has found a wide fashion audience, versions by designers including The Row, Prada, Staud, and many more have put their mark on the minimal, chic sandal that pairs with just about anything.  Whether you like a little color or a lot of sparkle, a shoe that takes center stage is the perfect thing to have in your arsenal to make all of those little black dresses, denim, and suits truly have infinite lives. Evangelie sells the look. Stomp around sneakers that are as cool as they are comfy are a non-negotiable. Aleali May makes the case in these little white trainers. Just because a boot can handle sleet and snow doesn't mean it can't be chic, too. Get you a boot that can do both.  One true athletic sneaker that also nails a leisurely weights session? Sign us up. Gabriela dresses up her McQueen combat boot, but this is the stomp-around shoe that you'll return to over and over again. Whether you're into something military inspired, more of a moto girl, or down for something cowboy-inspired, the idea is consistent.  Whether you take your boot stacked, skinny heeled, or flat is less important than the fact that it hits below the knee and makes a sleek statement.  Animal prints manage to make a statement without overpowering a look‚Äîas seen in Tiffany Hsu's chic tan and cream ensemble offset by animal-print boots.  A great sleek bootie will take you miles‚Äîquite literally. Tamu's little bootie is especially intriguing.  A great metallic heel can solve more problems than you could possibly conjure now. You'll be thankful they're in your closet every time you go to wear them.  This menswear inspired shoe can come in loafer or lace-up form, but must be flat, and must elicit either school girl or rich businessman vibes.

 Now this is an unlikely pairing... Philipp Plein's show at New York Fashion Week was nothing short of legendary. Not only did Plein have Irina Shayk walking the runway for him, but he also transformed Brooklyn Navy Yard into a site right out of Roswell. To start with, Shayk was beamed onto the runway from a spaceship: A spaceship which everyone danced under after the show: But perhaps the best detail of all was when Shayk walked the runway hand in hand with a robot. And this wasn't just any robot. Looking like a Transformers cast member, the Plein-branded robot towered above Shayk, but somehow managed to gracefully take the runway. With a dusting of fake snow on the ground, the entire show was completely filmic.  Of his extravagant shows, Plein told the BBC, "A fashion show is a bit like a happy funeral. You work so hard for months on putting a show together, and then the moment you reveal the collection to the public, you've buried it, because then you have to start working on a new one." But Plein's latest, UFO-inspired show, will be hard to forget. One of Plein's previous shows was a major focal point back in September 2017, when model and singer Teyana Taylor stormed the runway. Taylor, who is probably best known for featuring in Kanye West's "Fade" music video, performed the most incredible dance routine on Plein's runway, while Future performed live. Still, Plein's latest innovation, of including robots in his fashion shows, is likely to get the world even more excited about what the coveted designer will dare to create next.
 The French fashion house's latest offering is a pleasant surprise for the audiophile in your life. If you thought Apple's meme-worthy AirPods were a viral status symbol, then wait until you get a look at Louis Vuitton's ultra-luxe monogram wireless Horizon earphones that are set to retail later this year.  For the storied French house's first-ever foray into the audio market, it's collaborating with Master & Dynamic, a New York-based audio brand company to offer super stylish auditory accoutrements.   The earbuds come in four colorway options‚Äîattention-grabbing red monogram, simple-yet-sleek black, classic white, and yellow and blue LV stripes‚Äîand offer up to three-and-a-half hours of listening time on a single charge. The retail price is $995.    To house your new equipment, LV is offering a concave-shaped stainless steel charging case that is available in white for the matching earbuds and black for the other three color combinations. The charging case also provides the earphones with a total of ten hours of battery life, perfect for your on-the-go lifestyle and next jet-setting adventure.  These statement-making Bluetooth headphones are also compatible with both Apple and Android devices‚Äîincluding Siri and Google Assistant softwares, respectively. They're also compatible with all Bluetooth devices. While this may be Louis Vuitton's first pair of headphones, the brand previously launched tech with the Tambour Horizon smart watch in 2017.  There's no release date for Louis Vuitton's sleek and monogrammed Horizon earbuds just yet. However, in the meantime, we've rounded up similar wireless and Bluetooth compatible headphones that you can shop right now to keep your ears occupied until the French house drops its upcoming release.

 The collection arrives in time for fashion month. Karl Lagerfeld is teaming up with Vans for a capsule collection of apparel and footwear launching September 7.  Expect to see Vans' signature checkered pattern remixed with Lagerfeld's side profile, textured boucle fabrics and quilted-leather K motifs, WWD reports. Though there are no photos yet, the collection promises leather, laceless iterations of Vans' Sk8-Hi and Old Skool designs (AKA the black and white sneaks beloved by bloggers and the street style set), and a leather Classic Slip-On. There'll also be a graphic tee emblazoned with an image of Lagerfeld wearing a Vans checkerboard tie, and bomber jackets and backpacks are also in the mix.  Prices range from $40-$300. The collection will be available online and in-store at select Karl Lagerfeld and Vans locations. The unexpected union proves high fashion's obsession with skate-wear isn't dead just yet. (The collab arrives eight months after Louis Vuitton x Supreme debuted on the runways in January.)

 Yes please.  A growing number of designers may be exiting New York Fashion Week, but rumor has it that Anthony Vaccarello is bringing Saint Laurent's next runway show to the Big Apple. According to WWD, the French fashion brand may be taking a break from its usual runway setting in Paris to stage a show in New York this June. The show, which will reportedly take place on June 6, will follow this year's CFDA Awards on June 4 and also coincide with the CFDA's first women's summer fashion week, which is scheduled to take place from June 3rd - 7th.  Though Saint Laurent has yet to officially confirm a New York show, sources told WWD the runway will include both womenswear and menswear. It's unclear which season the collection would be for, though it's likely this could mark the brand's first cruise runway show. Designers typically stage destination runway shows for their cruise collections, so Saint Laurent's trek to New York wouldn't be entirely out of the ordinary.  If the reports are true, Saint Laurent won't be the only European fashion house coming stateside this season. Prada also plans to show its Cruise 2019 collection in New York on May 4, though an exact location has yet to be announced. Other designers traveling for their Cruise 2019 shows include Louis Vuitton, which will show its collection in the French Riviera on May 30, and Gucci, which will show in Arles, France that same day.  Looks like it will be a jet-setting season of runway shows for the fashion crowd. 
 The French fashion house announced her appointment today.  Karl Lagerfeld held a prolific tenure at the helm of Chanel from 1983 to his final days in 2019. Who could possibly follow in the revolutionary designer's footsteps? The French fashion house announced today that Virginie Viard, Lagerfeld's right-hand, will take over the creative operations for the brand following the designer's passing "so that the legacy of Gabrielle Chanel and Karl Lagerfeld can live on."  Here's what you need to know about the new designer leading Chanel.  Viard started at Chanel as an intern for haute-couture embroidery in 1987, The Telegraph reports. That's just four years after Lagerfeld became creative director of the iconic French brand. The chamberlain of Prince Rainier of Monaco recommended her for the job.  After working together at Chanel, Viard  joined Lagerfeld at Chlo√© in 1992 and worked there for five years before returning to Chanel as the coordinator for haute couture, Viard told the French magazine Crash. She started working on ready-to-wear in 2000.    "I make the collections come to life with the ateliers and the M√©tiers d‚ÄôArt houses, based on Karl‚Äôs sketches," Viard told The Telegraph in 2017. "I coordinate the teams, liaise with suppliers and choose fabrics. Then, of course, I do fittings with Karl. As soon as I receive his sketches, the process begins. I try to please him, but I like to surprise him too."  Viard added that she and Lagerfeld speak "all the time" and they see each other every day. Sometime he sends her sketches via phone. "The complicity is total," she added.  Lagerfeld of Viard in Netflix's 7 Days Out documentary series, per Who What Wear: "Virginie is the most important person, not only for me but also for the atelier, for everything. She is my right arm and even if I don't see her, we are on the phone all the time."    Viard divulged to W magazine that Lagerfeld would text her in his beloved cat Choupette's voice, sometimes accompanying the messages with a photo of his pet. "He signs them, Your Choupette," she said. "He might not like that I‚Äôm saying this." Whether or not he minded the revelation of his playful texting habits, Lagerfeld and Viard's friendship is undeniable. "She is my right rector Virginie Viard, hand and my left hand,‚Äù the late designer told ELLE for its November 2018 issue. ‚ÄúOur relationship is essential, doubled by a very real friendship and affection."  Karl Lagerfeld and his beloved pet cat Choupette starred in a self portrait on the limited-edition cover of our October 2013 issue. The legendary designer passed away in Paris today. A post shared by  Harper's Bazaar UK (@bazaaruk) on Feb 19, 2019 at 4:07am PST Last month, Lagerfeld was absent from Chanel's couture shows in Paris because he "was feeling tired," according to a statement from the French brand at the time. Viard took the final bow in his place, accompanied by model Vittoria Ceretti, who donned the final look: an embellished bridal swimsuit. She's also joined Lagerfeld for final bows at the Chanel Metiers D'Art 2018/2019 show in New York in December and the beach-themed Spring/Summer 2019 show in Paris in October.    Viard hails from a fashion-loving family. Her grandparents were silk manufacturers, she told Crash. "I was also attracted to the industry, but most of all I wanted to make theater costumes," she told the magazine. "I started in costume production as assistant to Dominique Borg, who notably produced costumes for Camille Claudel; then I was a costume designer for films and plays, until I met Karl, who suggested I work at Chanel and then Chlo√©."  Though Viard ultimately worked in fashion, she she did make impressive moves in the film realm, working with French actress Isabelle Adjani and directors Bruno Nuytten. She also designed the costumes for Three Colors: Blue (1993), which starred Juliette Binoche, and Three Colors: White (1994) both directed by Polish director Krzysztof Kieslowski. 
 It's pretty much perfect, so we understand why it sold out in the first place... After Jacquemus' La Bomba collection, the piece I've seen grace the bods of Insta fashion celebs the most is inarguably Realisation Par's The Naomi skirt. It has the heart of a silk slip dress done up in a midi-length skirt in a perfect leopard print‚Äîand every leopard print lover worth her salt knows they're not all created equal.  SHOP NOW As soon its cool factor, versatility, potential for longevity and overall grand appeal clicked...it sold out. If there's anything the fashion industry offers now, it's options. So usually I'm able to move on from a piece like I did after a break-up in college (onto the next!). But this one stuck in my head like a good melody‚Äîand searched as a might for a similar one, nothing quite fit the bill. That's the thing with a leopard print silk midi skirt‚Äîit seems like something that should already be in your closet, but somehow isn't yet. Today that all changed when the skirt hit Realisation Par's site again, fully restocked and under $200‚Äîbut selling fast.   Right now the social elite (read: Instagram influencers), are wearing it mainly with cropped pieces, from airy cut off-tanks to summer-weight sweaters and more structured black pieces. We're picturing it with chunky knits and booties come fall, or paired with a white maillot for poolside cocktails this weekend. Realisation Par is the brainchild of fashion blogger Alexandra Spencer and designer Teale Talbot, and the two apparently know a little something about pieces that end up on a girl's wish list until they end up in her closet. Consider this one: mission accomplished.

To amp up the heat, she opts for a bright orange handbag with a crocodile-skin pattern and jewelry from her other line, Bagatiba.  "It's really fun making your own things," she says, referencing her different brands. "I make things in such small quantities that I know that if I go into a room, somebody else really isn't gonna be wearing what I'm wearing. It's still very niche. And it inspires me to create more."   YouTuber and Eggie founder Jenn Im aims for a soft, floral look that fits in perfectly with Los Angeles's cooling weather.  She's wearing her line's Lyla dress, which features an orange floral print, tulle, and breezy sleeves. She gives the feminine look a sharp edge with clear heels by Schutz and a mini Palm Springs Louis Vuitton backpack. For accessories, she dons interlinked silver hoop earrings by Adornmonde and a custom name necklace by Bychari. "It's amazing for parties and any social gatherings," says Im, referring to her custom necklace. "There's really no excuse for no one to remember my name. I almost feel like every person in the world should have a little name tag like this. It's just a nice cheat code."   "My style is fun," says Carlson, the cofounder of Wildflower Cases. "It's flirty and sassy, but cute and easy." Her quintessential look begins with vintage black heeled boots from French brand Free Lance. She pairs them with a floral milkmaid minidress from Squaresville, a vintage shop in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Silver Lake. For accessories, she opts for a vintage Fendi handbag, silver hoop earrings from Chrome Hearts, and a Cupid-themed phone case from Wildflower Cases. "I always usually match my phone case to my outfits," she says.  Watch the rest of the video above to see all of the pieces Jessie, Jenn, and Devon are wearing, and then add them to your cart.

 Prince Harry told her, "Oh my God, thank you, she looks absolutely stunning." Meghan Markle surprised us when she showed up to her royal wedding wearing Givenchy. After rumors pointed to Erdem, Alexander McQueen, and Ralph & Russo over the past few months, the bride ultimately turned to creative director Clare Waight Keller to create her simple, elegant gown.  Due to the intense speculation surrounding the details of Meghan's gown ahead of the May 19th ceremony, the Givenchy artistic director was forced to keep mum about her five-month-long dress design process. She didn't even tell her husband, American architect Philip Keller, she was working on it. In fact, he didn't find out until the morning of the wedding.  Clare Waight Keller on designing Meghan‚Äôs wedding dress: ‚ÄúShe looked just incredible and it¬†showed.‚Äù https://t.co/zhvnM1VAXT pic.twitter.com/9aDMVEnFHI  Markle approached Keller in January and already "had an idea of what she wanted," the designer told ITV the morning after the wedding. She and the now-Duchess of Sussex "worked very closely together" to create the design. Sketches of The Duchess of Sussex‚Äôs #RoyalWedding dress, designed by Clare Waight Keller, have been released.The Duchess and Ms. Waight Keller worked closely together on the design, epitomising a timeless minimal elegance referencing the codes of the iconic House of Givenchy. pic.twitter.com/A9ZFKVZmUz Keller, a Brit behind the French fashion house, aimed for a "modern, fresh" design. She wanted Meghan to "feel absolutely incredible in the dress and also I wanted her to feel like it was absolutely right for the occasion." The designer praised Markle as genuine, warm, radiant, and a "strong woman." "She knows what she wants and really it was an absolute joy working with her," she said, per Hello!'s royal reporter Emily Nash.  Dress designer Clare Waight-Keller on Meghan: ‚ÄúShe is just exactly what you see on TV. She is just so genuine and warm and radiant. She is just glowing. And she‚Äôs a strong woman. She knows what she wants and really it was an absolute joy working with her.‚Äù #royalwedding The final result was a bateaux neckline gown with three-quarter sleeves, a sculpted waist, and a soft, round train supported by a triple-silk organza underskirt. The number was made by a small team of ateliers in Paris, using an "exclusive double bonded silk cady" fabric from Europe, the Kensington Palace revealed yesterday. Prince Harry was also personally a fan of the look. He even approached her and personally thanked her for creating the dress, Keller recalled. "He came straight up to me and he said, ‚ÄòOh my God, thank you, she looks absolutely stunning,'" she said.  Meghan's dress designer Clare Waight Keller said about Harry: ‚ÄúHe came straight up to me and he said ‚Äòoh my God, thank you, she looks absolutely stunning‚Äô." #royalwedding In addition to creating the dress, Keller designed a trailing veil that included a flower from each of the 53 countries in the commonwealth embroidered at the hem.  "A lot of the work she's probably going to do in the future will be connection to the Commonwealth, and so that was something I really thought could be quite compelling,"  she added to ITV. Meghan loved the idea.  As the first female artistic director of Givenchy, Keller felt her story might've resonated with Markle, a vocal feminist and supporter of women's rights. "That was maybe part of her story," she said.  Clare W-K on Meghan: ‚ÄúI think she really admired the fact that I was a woman designer and the many companies I have worked for, British companies and international companies and the fact that I am a working mother played into it as well, so that was maybe part of her story.‚Äù Ultimately, Keller felt "truly privileged" and "flattered" to take on the "enormous honor" of designing a royal wedding dress. "I'm so proud to have been part of it," she told ITV.  Stella McCartney, who designed Meghan's high-collar second wedding dress for the Frogmore House reception, also responded to dressing the famous bride.  "I am so proud and honored to have been chosen by the Duchess of Sussex to make her evening gown and represent British design,‚Äù McCartney told WWD. ‚ÄúIt has truly been one of the most humbling moments of my career and I am so proud of all the team on this stunning sunny royal day.‚Äù This post has been updated.
 Upon her new retrospective opening at London‚Äôs National Portrait Gallery, the trailblazing artist talks personal style and her arch take on conventional femininity.  I‚Äôve gone through many phases along with my characters‚Äîsometimes un-flattering, sometimes totally unrecognizable. There‚Äôs never been a straight line of evolution. You‚Äôll see this in my retrospective opening in June at London‚Äôs National Portrait Gallery. I used to want to blend into the crowd when I was younger, like I disappear into my work. But now I‚Äôm more drawn toward being a bit flashy if the opportunity presents itself. I wear a lot of color and mixed prints from Prada, Marni, and Zero + Maria Cornejo. I dress very casually in the daytime but prefer longer dresses when I go out.  My biggest splurge is jewelry. I like the idea of art being a small wearable object, as opposed to the usual giant scale that signifies value. So I have several special pieces from Repossi, Verdura, and Codognato. I‚Äôm more prone to wear flats than pumps, but I also  like chunky heels and platforms. Simone Rocha wingtips are one of my go-to‚Äôs. I‚Äôm always changing my handbag. Louis Vuitton, Dior, and Celine are a few of my favorites. My favorite accessory is my Apple Watch. It‚Äôs the one thing I don‚Äôt have to think about. I can‚Äôt remember one good piece of style advice I‚Äôve ever received. Either I‚Äôve never asked for any or I‚Äôve never gotten any. The women in my life who most influenced my personal style are the housewives I saw on TV and in ads during my childhood. It wasn‚Äôt always a positive influence. Overall I‚Äôd say my personal style is unconventional and somewhat boyish. Of course, I also ironically play with femininity and makeup. MicheÃÄle Lamy is one of my style icons for being edgy and fearless. I also love Michelle Obama because she supports younger designers and is always sophisticated. My one beauty essential is eye cream, as my skin is so dry. I‚Äôm not really bound to any one brand, as long as I‚Äôm not allergic to it. Perfume doesn‚Äôt really stay on my skin. But I love Narciso Rodriguez for Her and Superstitious, Alber Elbaz‚Äôs fragrance collaboration with FreÃÅdeÃÅric Malle.   Art and flowers are my favorite gifts to give. They are also my favorite gifts to receive. My favorite destination in the world is my home. Wherever it is. I have no rules. I also have no weekend ritual. For artists, there isn‚Äôt one.
 The fashion house tapped 17 famous women to debut its latest collection.  In lieu of a traditional runway show, Nicolas Ghesqui√®re debuted Louis Vuitton's Pre-Fall 2019 collection with a celebrity-filled lookbook. From A-listers like Michelle Williams and Ruth Negga to rising stars like Indya Moore and Urassaya Sperbund, the brand tapped 17 stylish women who "illustrate the diversity of feminine expression" to model its latest collection.‚ÄúThese women embrace the various personalities that embody fashion at Louis Vuitton. Be they stars or new faces, all of them share the same willpower and confidence in their choices, and at the same time, reflect the eclecticism of the female identity,‚Äù Ghesqui√®re said in a statement from the brand.Much like the women wearing it, Vuitton's Pre-Fall '19 collection ranges from ultra-feminine lace and florals to edgier leather and plaids. The collection also includes new takes on the brand's signature logo bags and leather goods. Scroll down to see the star-studded lookbook in its entirety. 
 The brand is tapping into a market that's usually ignored by luxury designers. Tommy Hilfiger has announced plans to make a line of clothes for people with disabilities, Bloomberg has reported. The American fashion label is tapping into a market usually ignored by luxury fashion brands. The adaptive clothing line will feature adjusted seams and openings that make it easier for caretakers to dress the wearer, as well as magnetic closures so that it is easier to pull garments over the head or to get dressed with one hand. Trousers will have velcro and magnetic flies, while leg openings and hems will be adjustable to accommodate for leg braces. The men‚Äôs line will feature 37 pieces and the women‚Äôs 34 styles. In a statement, Hilfiger described moving into this market as part of a ‚Äúdemocratization of fashion.‚Äù With millions of disabled people worldwide who would no doubt welcome this news, the decision also makes great sense financially.

 "Alright, motherf*ckers! Now, every woman needs to have a pointy shoe." After topping charts with a song about Louboutins, Cardi B continues her shoe obsession with a new partnership with Steve Madden. The rapper curated a collection of the brand's shoes‚Äîwhich ranges from vampy over-the-knee boots to work-friendly pumps‚Äîand models the styles in a video campaign. In the cheeky, unfiltered clips, (reminiscent of her own Instagram videos) she offers her "daily tips" on dressing, accessorizing, and basically living your best life. On day-to-night style:  "Alright, motherf*ckers! Now, every woman needs to have a pointy shoe. If I button this shirt, I could wear this to a business meeting but I could wear this to the club." On making affordable clothes look expensive: "I'm just gonna keep it real, right? I look rich as hell ('cause I am). You could look rich too, because look at these boots. They Steve Madden, bitch." On (patriotic) daytime dressing: "Alright y'all, so now I'm giving you cute, sexy, daytime vibes. Right now white boots are in style, and they made in the USA." On statement pieces: "You know what makes a outfit? A good, poppin-ass shoe. Who don't like pink? P*ssy-poppin' pink." On letting your shoes be extra: "These are called the Wifey. It's not the type of shiny, but it's like, 'Oh my God, what? Why her shoes so shiny? She think she in da club, like damn, we only going to brunch!'" Cardi started teasing her Steve Madden collab weeks ago, as she sported shoes by the footwear brand and gave shoutouts to the label on Instagram back in November. "Ladies you don‚Äôt have to break the bank," she wrote in one photo.  
 
 "I don't want my children to ever look back and think, ‚ÄòGosh, I wish I hadn't done that.‚Äô" Cindy Crawford says she's lucky she doesn't have a #MeToo story to share, but admits she regrets certain nude shoots that she felt coerced into doing. The 52-year-old supermodel is now mentor, manager and mother to her two model children Presley and Kaia - and in the wake of the #MeToo movement, she wants to "empower" them to be able to say no if they feel uncomfortable at work. "I've done nude photos, lots," Crawford told Town & Country. "The only ones I regretted were the ones that I kind of got talked into.  "I don't want my children to ever look back and think, ‚ÄòGosh, I wish I hadn't done that.‚Äô I want to empower them to just say, 'I'm outta here.'" Reflecting on the women and men speaking up about sexual harassment and abuse in Hollywood and beyond, she continued: "I'm really lucky, because I don't have a #MeToo story. "As far as being a mother of two young people going into fashion, of course I worry. But let's be honest. My kids are blessed in that business because they aren't coming in as unknowns. People will know I will come after them if they mess with my kids."    being fools for @calvinklein #mycalvins A post shared by  Kaia (@kaiagerber) on Mar 14, 2018 at 9:09am PDT  Presley, 18, and Kaia, 16, have dominated the catwalks during recent fashion weeks, and recently landed a Calvin Klein campaign together. Kaia made her couture show debut at Chanel earlier this year, and stars in the French fashion house's latest handbag campaign.  #chanelhandbagstories @chanelofficial by Karl ‚ù§Ô∏è A post shared by  Kaia (@kaiagerber) on Apr 3, 2018 at 6:17am PDT On her relationship with with her in-demand teenage model daughter Kaia, Crawford added: "We talk every day, at least, and text.  "If she doesn't text me back within 15 minutes, I do one in all caps and a lot of exclamation points. Just respond, okay? Or else I‚Äôm going to track you through your Uber account."

 The first installment is a collaboration with Paola Alberdi, the blogger behind Blank Itinerary. Amazon Fashion is betting big on influencers. Today, the e-commerce behemoth is releasing its inaugural street-style inspired collection with Paola Alberdi, the blogger behind Blank Itinerary.  The limited-edition capsule collection, called The Drop, sees Alberdi sporting outfits she co-designed with Amazon.    Along with on-trend outfit staples‚Äîa taupe polka dot blouse with ruched long sleeves, a sunshine yellow wrap dress, and an oversized vest‚ÄîAlberdi also incorporated blazer, one of her favorite wardrobe must-haves, for the warm weather. The San Diego-based influencer's Mexican-American culture also played a role in the Amazon collaboration. "Mexican women love dressing up, and growing up in a bi-cultural family, I was very much influenced by that," Alberdi told BAZAAR.com. "I was surrounded by sophisticated women who were always dressed so elegantly. I‚Äôve also been influenced by European styles since I lived in Spain when I was younger." Each piece from the influencer-heavy digital campaign is only available for purchase within 30 hours of its initial release through the Amazon app or on a mobile web browser. After consumers buy pieces from the select group of influencers‚ÄîEmi Suzuki, Sierra Furtado, Leonie Hanne, and Patricia Bright have also joined the roster‚Äîthen their garments will be made on-demand and delivered within a few weeks.   Alberdi kept "the girl on-the-go" in mind when creating her neutral-toned collection of pieces so shoppers can mix and match items. She noted that an accessible price point enables consumers to "feel confident in the way they present themselves through fashion without having to spend so much to accomplish that." Check out the full collection, modeled by Alberdi below.
 Prepare to fall in love with the finale gown.  Inspired by the late Oscar de la Renta's love of art galleries, Laura Kim and Fernando Garcia's Spring 2018 collection for the fashion house was full of color, volume, and most importantly, dreamy gowns. From feminine-infused tulle to colorful sequin logos,  the brand's spring gowns made quite the impact while entering and exiting the runway via an escalator. Scroll down to see all the breathtaking gowns featured in the collection in photos and in motion on Instagram. 
 The brand showcases its spring collection with a video titled "Why Can't We Get Along?"  Like many other fashion brands, rag & bone is continuing to push the boundaries of the traditional runway show format.  Last September, the brand skipped New York Fashion Week and instead unveiled its Spring 2018 collection through a series of self-portraits. The photo project starring Selah Marley, Georgia Fowler, Bobby Cannavale, Maye Musk, Tali Lennox and more not only debuted the brand's latest pieces, but also had a charitable component‚Äìallowing each of its subjects to make a donation to a non-profit organization of their choice.  Now, just a week ahead of this season's New York Fashion Week shows, rag & bone found another visual medium to showcase its Spring 2018 collection: short film. Titled  Why Can't We Get Along?, the dance video choreographed by Benjamin Millepied stars Kate Mara and Ansel Elgort along with eight members of the American Ballet Theatre, three Hiplet Ballerinas, YouTube star and dancer Kandi Reign, and three members of Bullettrun Parkour.  Described by the brand as "a visual experiment and a metaphor which illustrates why seeing the world from different perspectives can often be difficult," the mesmerizing six-minute film hopes to create "dialogue about perspective and visual experimentation."  Each dancer in the video wears a look from rag & bone's Spring 2018 collection, which is available to shop now at rag-bone.com‚Äîcertainly making for a fresh way to market a fashion collection. While dance and choreography videos have long been taking over YouTube and Instagram feeds across the globe, will they have the power to sell clothes?   
 This video will have you feeling all the feels.  In March, Virgil Abloh made history when he was appointed the menswear artistic director of Louis Vuitton‚Äîbecoming the first African-American to hold the position at the French fashion house. Today, the designer presented his first collection for Louis Vuitton Men's in Paris and things got pretty emotional when longtime friend and collaborator Kanye West was there to support him in the front row.   As Abloh took his final bow at the end of the show, he ran to embrace Kanye. The two shared a truly touching moment and began crying as they hugged on the runway.    And it's nearly impossible to watch the video without feeling all the feels.  Virgil runs into Ye‚Äôs arms at the close of his 1st show for #LouisVuitton What a moment! #LVMenSS19 https://t.co/Nk5LSCS3Jg Abloh and West, both originally from Chicago, have been friends since the early 2000s and even interned at Fendi together in 2009. Following their internship, West appointed Abloh the creative director of his agency, DONDA. At the show, which was held in the garden of the Palais-Royal in Paris, West sat alongside wife Kim Kardashian West, sister-in-law Kylie Jenner, and rapper Travis Scott. Tracks from the rapper's newly-released album, Ye, were also played during the show.   In a recent interview with Axel Vervoordt, West seemed conflicted about his feelings on Abloh's appointment at Louis Vuitton. ‚ÄúI had been dealing with a very heavy concept this week that I couldn't get out of my head," the rapper revealed. When pressed about what happened, he answered, "It's not bad or good, it's my creative collaborator being the head of Louis Vuitton."  Despite his hard-to-decipher comments, West's appearance at Abloh's LV debut today proves the creative duo's bond is just as strong as ever. And regardless of your feelings on West's many controversial and problematic comments as of late, it was a powerful moment to witness. 
 The epic show featured an all black runway cast, and celebrated age and size diversity. Back in October 2018, it was revealed that Tommy Hilfiger would be collaborating with Zendaya, after a four-year stint working with Gigi Hadid. Fast forward to Paris Fashion Week, and #TommyXZendaya's first runway show is upon us. The runway was turned into a '70s roller rink, complete with a light up floor. Drenched in red disco lights at the start of the show, models wore roller skates while showcasing the eclectic new collection. Basically, the launch of Tommy x Zendaya was a literal party, which is totally apt:    LIVE from Paris, it`s the debut of #TommyXZendaya and #TOMMYNOW SS19! üá´üá∑ Don`t miss a single runway moment. #TommyHilfiger #PFW https://t.co/1TLYBOPb3H  Per a press release, Zendaya and Hilfiger were influenced by "'70s icons and the 1973 Battle of Versailles fashion show." The show was incredibly inclusive, featuring an all black runway cast‚Äî"59 black women, ages 18 to 70," per ELLE‚Äîeach diverse in size and age. Zendaya's commitment to only casting women of color, and celebrating size and age inclusivity, is truly inspiring.  It was also important to Zendaya and Hilfiger to cast models who have inspired them. The world's first black supermodel, Pat Cleveland, was joined on the runway by a plethora of legendary models including Beverly Peele, Beverly Johnson, Veronica Webb, Debra Shaw, and Chryst√®le Saint Louis Augustin. Winnie Harlow and Jourdan Dunn also walked, and icon Grace Jones brought the house down as she closed the show:  @tommyhilfiger x @zendaya proving that inclusivity is a BIG party.  A little help from legends like Grace Jones, Pat Cleveland, and Beverley Johnson doesn‚Äôt hurt either üòç. ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä ‚Ä¢ ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä #ad #tommyxzendaya #tommynow #tommyhilfiger #gracejones #pulluptomybumperbaby #patcleveland #beverlyjohnson #battleofversailles #pfw #parisfashionweek #inclusivity #positivity #diversity #diversitymatters #bodypositive #adaptive #tommyadaptive #model #supermodel #zendaya #lawroach #ootd #wiwt #disco #rollerdisco #discofloor #dietprada A post shared by  Diet Prada ‚Ñ¢ (@diet_prada) on Mar 2, 2019 at 3:30pm PST Per WWD, Hilfiger revealed, "Our innovative ‚Äòsee-now-buy-now‚Äô experiential show will blend our Americana heritage, Zendaya‚Äôs confidence and optimism, and the city‚Äôs iconic elements for a truly unforgettable runway event."  Zendaya debuted several pieces from the collection ahead of its first runway show: In January 2019, Zendaya expressed her excitement about the collaboration in an interview with Harper's BAZAAR saying, "He told me how I would be able to truly have creative control from concept to clothing, down to the font on the packaging. I was in heaven when I showed up with my inspiration boards and a million ideas, and I was allowed to just go for it, with all the support in the world." Hilfiger previously revealed in a statement why The Greatest Showman star was the perfect brand ambassador saying, "Zendaya has become a global icon, using fashion to make bold statements while always staying true to herself. Our capsule collection will fuse her eclectic style with the Americana spirit of our brand."

 Anok Yai just became the second black woman ever to open a Prada show. The first was Naomi Campbell.  Last night, model Anok Yai made history at Prada's Fall 2018 show during Milan Fashion Week.  The 19-year-old became the second black model to ever open a Prada show. The first was Naomi Campbell back in 1997. Yes, it's been over two decades since a woman of color opened a Prada runway.    Anok took to Instagram to thank Miuccia Prada, along with her team, for the opportunity, writing, "Can't believe I'm the first black woman to open for Prada since queen @iamnaomicampbell, forever grateful." The model's monumental runway walk is especially incredible as she was just discovered last fall while attending Howard University‚Äôs homecoming. Weeks later, she signed with Next Models. And just one month ago, she made her runway debut at Prada's Menswear Fall 2018 show.  Of course, the fact that Prada hasn't cast a woman of color to open its show in over two decades is problematic in itself. In the past, the brand has come under scrutiny for its lack of diversity both on the runway and in its campaigns. Hopefully, Anok opening the Fall 2018 show is an indication the Italian fashion house is headed in the right direction when it comes to diversity. Extremely slowly, but surely, more and more brands are recognizing the importance of casting diverse runways. This season's Fall 2018 shows at New York Fashion Week marked the most racially diverse of all time‚Äîwith women of color accounting for 37.3% of all castings.  Still, there's a lot of work to be done. 
 Each pup featured is up for adoption.  Fashion, charity AND puppies? For its pre-fall 2019 campaign, MONSE is blending its love of animals and style by partnering with six animal shelters (Animal Haven, Best Friends Animal Society, Bideawee, Rescue City, Rescue Dogs Rock, and Social Tees) in the tri-state area to help promote the adoption and fostering of dogs.  MONSE also recruited Disney to appropriately incorporate one of the most famous dogs ever, Mickey Mouse's sidekick Pluto, into the collection. The stylish campaign images feature 35 adorable pups from local shelters who are each looking for a loyal home, and dog lovers everywhere may not be able to resist.  For MONSE, the integration of the furry friends was a natural fit. "Dogs are family at MONSE, and are often seen running around the office,‚Äù says Laura Kim and Fernando Garcia, who founded the brand in 2015. ‚ÄúWe knew we wanted our Pre-Fall collection to benefit this cause, so this was the perfect opportunity to highlight Pluto, who is a loveable dog just like many of the ones featured in our campaign."  While the pre-fall collection won't be available until May 2019, a selection of 10 pieces from the collection (for both dogs and humans) will be available to shop on MONSE.com. 100% of proceeds from sales of the selected items will be distributed among the six shelters.   MONSE is also making additional donations to each of the charities including contributions on behalf of the campaign's models, Cat McNeil, Lameka Fox, and McKenna Hellam, who volunteered their time for this special project.

 The leading lady of Tennis talks music, style, and her biggest inspirations.  AM: Patrick and I met in our senior year of college. I planned on grad school, but Patrick planned on moving aboard a small sailboat and sailing around the world. That intrigued me, since we had both grown up in landlocked Colorado. He had been saving for a sailboat since he was twelve. This intrigued me further. By the time we graduated, he enlisted me as crew. We lived and voyaged on a 30-foot sailboat together for the better part of a year.  Get the Look 
  During this time, we had very limited electricity from a small battery bank, not enough to power a stereo, so we were unable to listen to music. The silence made us crave music acutely. We fantasized about what we would listen to if we could, which evolved into making music of our own. When we returned home we started writing and recording for fun and sharing our music on Myspace, that was the beginning of Tennis. It was a slow, indirect path, influenced by many things outside of music.  Get the Look 
 AM: I notice sometimes‚Äîand I am always surprised by this‚Äîthat we have inadvertently stumbled into some sort of zeitgeist, like the resurgence of analogue recording or ‚Äò60s-‚Äò70s nostalgia, and suddenly we are part of a scene. What sets us apart from many of our peers is the nature of our ambition. Rather than being the biggest band, we want to be the freest band, with maximum autonomy. This motivated us to leave our label and start our own called Mutually Detrimental. I want to create without being under the thumb of whoever footed the bill. Running our own label frees us from those obligations and allows us to experiment with songwriting and album campaigns in a way that most labels would be uncomfortable with.  Get the Look What sets us apart from many of our peers is the nature of our ambition.  Gucci  Gucci Gucci Gucci Gucci AM: We wrote much of our last album while voyaging in the Sea of Cortez on our 30-foot sailboat. We lived in little coves and fishing villages for nearly five months. On this album, we wrote ourselves free from the expectations of an industry that hounded us for radio singles and increasingly clever release strategies. I wrote simple and sincere songs about my inner world, reflections on womanhood, marriage, my relationship to the world. It was extremely cathartic. The album is called Yours Conditionally.  AM: When a song works it has an ineffable quality of completion. Not perfection, but completion. I always strive for that in a song, though it eludes me all the time. I have a complicated relationship with performing because I see myself more as a writer than an entertainer, and never feel totally at home onstage. My goal with a performance is always to do the songs justice, and show my most vulnerable, truthful self to the audience. I have no stage persona. I don‚Äôt want to have to live up to some larger than life figure that I‚Äôve invented on stage after night. I only want to have to be myself. And usually that is challenge enough.    AM: I think there is a mutual, reinforcing relationship between our visual and sonic aesthetic. Where I look for inspiration in music is usually where I find inspiration visually. The thing that‚Äôs taken me the longest to figure out is my hair. I never knew what to do with my curls, which always felt was anathema to me. Then one day I found a photo of Sandra Bernhard in The King of Comedy, and a photo of Whitney Houston on tour in the ‚Äò80s, and I was like, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs my hair.‚Äù   Now my insane hair is kind of like the set piece to all of our visuals and I style everything around it.  AM: We are both involved at every level. It is important that we both feel heard, creatively fulfilled, and equally carry our own weight. The easiest path to resentment is to feel like one of you is working harder than the other. That‚Äôs something we are always wary of.  AM: I am most inspired by film. The movie 3 Women by Robert Altman, Twin Peaks by David Lynch, Buffalo 66 by Vincent Gallo, to name a few. I am also obsessed with Solange and Chlo√´ Sevigny‚Äôs personal style.  AM: I am a longtime fan of Gucci and look to Alessandro Michele‚Äôs collections to help me come up with new ways of styling my own wardrobe. I‚Äôm also working really hard to stop buying fast fashion and support ethically made clothing.    AM: We have a special relationship with the McKittrick Hotel since we played an album release show in the upstairs venue that was incredibly beautiful and intimate. We always have magical nights on that rooftop bar and I never get tired of seeing Sleep No More, a unique theatrical production you can only experience there. AM: Our looks for stage were absolutely stunning. Especially Pat‚Äôs suit, which I could not get enough of. I also loved my first look, I am a sucker for any variation of menswear.  AM: Gucci has mastered the art of drawing from the past without totally relying on it. This is the approach we take to our songwriting. We are nostalgists, but don‚Äôt want to rehash the past. We want to make something undeniably new.     Get the Look

 As Angela Missoni marks 20 years at the helm of her family‚Äôs iconic label, Joan Juliet Buck travels to Italy to break bread with the designer and reminisce with the clan. Her earlobes weighed down by enough charms to fill two bracelets, her hair in a topknot, Angela Missoni is claustrophobic in cities, alive with enthusiasm, lit by clarity. For 20 years the creative director of Missoni, she‚Äôs turned the family-owned company into a global luxury brand without forfeiting its intimate authenticity. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not looking for perfection,‚Äù she says, ‚Äúbut harmony.‚Äù I‚Äôve been in thrall to her family from the first time I saw a Missoni pullover in a magazine in 1967. Every possible color was joined into a lacy motif of faintly heraldic points as scalloped as fish scales, as feathered as bird wings. The colors said everything was possible, the lacy scales suggested that one could transcend human form, the pullover proved that fashion could bend toward joy. I was a goner.  I never owned that pullover, but it set off a craving for those patterns, those endless colors. When I grew up and got a job, I saved up for a silky Missoni cardigan at Browns in London, and I can still summon the glow set off by its tiny squares, two shades of turquoise dancing with two shades of red. The day the fashion editor Anna Piaggi introduced me to Tai and Rosita Missoni in 1973 in a London coffee shop, I was at first too mesmerized by live Missonis in Missoni, too fixated on the brown, purple, and turquoise of Tai‚Äôs sweater, the blue, black, and mauve of Rosita‚Äôs coat, to register how handsome they were, how warm, how lucid. Tai, a former Olympic athlete, was tall, sparkling, full of folk wisdom and Italian jokes I didn‚Äôt understand; Rosita, short and beautiful with close-cropped hair, had a gentle way of being bluntly honest. I moved to Italy as Women‚Äôs Wear Daily‚Äôs correspondent to get closer to them, and, I admit, to gain admittance to their factory at Sumirago, in the Varese countryside north of Milan, and root around their stockroom, where the magical patterns were folded on shelves in plastic bags stamped this bag is not a toy. I saw the looms that wove space-dyed thread into sunsets, other machines that created intricately varied stitches or raised stripes or wandering clusters of medallions, and the one that produced the scales and feathers of the original raschel lace. I watched Tai align dots of color into patterns on graph paper, and began to understand the skill that went into such protean magic.   It was no surprise that their house was in the woods next door to the factory, nor that it was full of bright Clarice Cliff pottery, Venetian glass, tribal textiles, jars of rare jams made by friends, modern sculpture, flea market paintings and pottery, bamboo sofas covered in Missoni fabrics and occupied by men in Missoni discussing football and art. On one wall hung a dazzling color wheel executed on a plate, a sample from an old porcelain manufacturer. Rosita swam every day in the pool beneath their terrace, and foraged for mushrooms in the woods below the sloping lawn. I met their three teenagers, Luca and Vittorio, and Angela, a shy 15-year-old, who one evening handed me a gift, a brooch of an iris in smoky mauves and greens.  In 1975, when their collections earned wild raves from the international press, I asked if they would expand the factory to meet the new demand. ‚ÄúWhy do that?‚Äù Rosita asked. ‚ÄúWhat if next season we‚Äôre not so popular? We‚Äôre staying just as we are.‚Äù  The friendship anchored my life in Milan; grew and endured, in Varese; in Paris, where Rosita was the only witness to my ghost of the Rue Jacob; in New York, where I sat by an East Village fire pit with Angela; in Los Angeles or Venice, where they loaned me their apartment by the Bridge of Sighs. They gave me blue cardigans to match the color of one man‚Äôs eyes, and then another‚Äôs. I still have the white Missoni camisole that started a romance in 1974, the scarves and shawls I shared with my mother, the bright stripes I wore when I edited French Vogue, the coats that Rosita took off her back to give me after a lunch, all touchstones.  The children married and had children‚Äîthree for Luca, three for Vittorio, three for Angela. She‚Äôd started helping in the factory at 18 to earn money, and promptly moved out and into a nearby house that Vittorio had just vacated. ‚ÄúI remember thinking when I was 19 that, wherever I landed, I could find a fianc√©, so a fianc√© from Varese was perfect. My first priority was to become a mother.‚Äù She married Marco Maccapani, an events producer, and at 24 gave birth to Margherita, then Francesco, then Teresa. ‚ÄúI was very introverted until I had my children. All that love that you can‚Äôt keep inside, all of a sudden it‚Äôs flowing out, and it changes you. That‚Äôs when I opened up to the world. Everything was related to the well-being of my kids, so I made a playground for the local children, and started an organic chicken farm for a while because I wanted them to have healthy food.‚Äù  When Angela was pregnant with her youngest, Teresa, she began her own projects for Missoni, particularly children‚Äôs clothes, and notes that Rosita was impressed that she‚Äôd mastered every stage in the process, from color cards on. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd been with my parents at every show from the age of 10, observing, observing, observing, and I have a visual memory of everything‚Äîclothes, details, a scarf, a button, heels, studs, makeup, hair, accessories.‚Äù I reminded her of the iris pin she‚Äôd given me. ‚ÄúIt was from the spring 1974 show at the Hotel Diana in Milan, when we showed volumes that were slightly Poiret.‚Äù  In 1997, Rosita handed over the fashion duties to Angela, and turned her attention to MissoniHome. Angela was 38, divorced, tall and voluptuous, with a mane of dark hair and the confident sensuality of a mid-century European movie star‚ÄîAnna Magnani, Simone Signoret. She introduced tight fits and deep cleavage to bring a bad-girl insouciance to what had become perceived as clothes for rich intellectuals, and hired Mario Testino, Juergen Teller, and Mert & Marcus for ad campaigns that added heat and a hint of menace to the wholesome Missoni image of family happiness.  ‚ÄúI have a cool head, I never panic; I‚Äôm the one with the Band-Aids.‚Äù It was a charmed life, until January 2013. Vittorio and his wife were returning from a holiday off the coast of Venezuela when the small plane they were in vanished. Before it was clear what had happened, Tai, who was 92 and in bad health, died. Angela kept everyone going. ‚ÄúI have a cool head, I never panic; I‚Äôm the one with the Band-Aids,‚Äù she says.  She also has rare talents: the capacity to be at once intuitive and strategic, run her fashion team, gauge proportions to a millimeter, put her models in pink pussy hats, indulge her appetites for fine art and flea-market kitsch, and still remain the steady hub of a family business, where children, grandchildren, and gardens carry as much daily weight as next season‚Äôs styles.  At the show that marked her 20 years as Missoni‚Äôs creative head, the outdoor runway in the courtyard of a former industrial space in Milan felt like a playground, shaded from the September sun by vast striped canopies in pink, turquoise, red, chartreuse, mauve, and aquamarine, commissioned from an artist Angela had found on Instagram, the American Rachel Hayes. The rented warehouse was calm before the show, each look planned well beforehand. Angela likes to say, ‚ÄúI have a mathematician‚Äôs mind.‚Äù Makeup artists painted the 69 models, girls and boys, as she told a TV crew, ‚ÄúNext year is our 65th anniversary; this show is my 20th-birthday party.‚Äù Backstage in the warehouse, her daughter Margherita, who returned from her New York It-girl time to marry Eugenio Amos, a race-car driver from Varese, kept an eye on her boys, Otto, four, and Augusto, two, while Teresa wheeled her six-month-old, Zeno, past a wandering Siberian model in platform sneakers. Angela‚Äôs brother Luca, the company‚Äôs historian, was outside with Vittorio‚Äôs three sons, as Rosita, radiant and vital at almost 86, faced a wall of photographers in her inimitable combination of polka-dotted Missoni sneakers, a black T-shirt painted with white zigzags, and a kimono jacket in blocks of pink, purple, green, yellow, blue, and rust. Chunky colored cubes on her long vintage necklace played off the hues of the coat.  Angela‚Äôs 20th-anniversary collection for Spring 2018 was as light as a mousse, with raschel lace in shades of sugared almonds, pastel Lurex, floating cloud skirts with bunched hems, and weightless candy-colored court coats. The fashion audience of almost a thousand cheered as Angela took her victory lap, a plain 15-year-old trench coat of many colors thrown over her black pants. After the show came a dinner in another barely reconfigured industrial space. And when her 200 friends, her longtime partner, Bruno Ragazzi, and her family had drunk the wine and the amaretto and eaten the Northern Italian feast of squash, porchetta, brasato, and lemon cream puffs, they joined some 700 more guests for a huge party under the Rachel Hayes canopies; the runway had become a dance floor, surrounded by chairs and sofas from Angela‚Äôs house and Rosita‚Äôs garden.  Dancing among skinny girls in Lurex and fashion freaks in giant hats, the New York interior designer Ricky Clifton declared: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here because I want to work for Angela. I want to get out of America.‚Äù His savior, Angela, patrolled the party on sheepdog duty, herding groups, making sure that hosts didn‚Äôt mislay houseguests, and that everyone had a drink. And then she danced. ‚ÄúDid you dance all night?‚Äù I asked the next day.  ‚ÄúNot all night,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI got a few hours of sleep, because there‚Äôs a local swap meet that only happens once a month, and I didn‚Äôt want to miss it‚Äîand I found treasures. Wait till you see the Fornasetti box I bought for three euros!‚Äù We were at her house above a sloping meadow in Brunello with a mountain in the distance, down the road from Tai and Rosita‚Äôs house and the factory. Her daughter Teresa lives behind the hedge with her partner, Giovanni, and baby Zeno. The pool is enclosed in a glass room alive with chirps from birds gathered on a table, the birds battery-driven, street-market plastic. A long table was waiting to be set up for the weekend party to celebrate Zeno‚Äôs christening, a lunch for 97 adults and 13 children. There would be much talk of sugared almonds. The house‚Äôs hard mid-century right angles can barely contain Angela‚Äôs profusion. Her collection of sculpted hands spills over the windowsills in her bedroom, which opens onto a terrace covered in wild grasses. The lower steps of the austerely elegant new staircase she designed have silted up with books and catalogues.  Her taste ranges from high art to jokes. There‚Äôs a Kusama in one of the bathrooms; a framed suite of hardware made from green organza by Do Ho Suh; and a neon word portrait of Ragazzi by Tracey Emin that spells out crimson sky the mirror glows i can still love you over the couch, but much of the loot is wonderfully bizarre: Afghani carpets patterned with tanks and automatic weapons, woven plastic flowers, ceramics‚Äîceramic dancers, ceramic baskets, ceramic Bambis, ceramic monsters, a ceramic Godzilla cut into ceramic sushi pieces by a little ceramic girl.  She rooted through her fresh swap-meet haul in the laundry room, set aside newly purchased antique dolls (‚ÄúYou clean them when you get them home, take their clothes off, wash them, wipe their bodies‚Äù) to find‚Äîbetween Madonnas for Teresa, butterflies for Margherita, new Bambi statuettes and a rough metal music box‚Äîthe 1950s Fornasetti box decorated with three pipes that had cost all of three euros. It was, I must admit, in very good shape. Before going down into Milan to run through marketing details with her team in the showroom, she crossed the meadow full of dandelions, her white smock billowing, to fill a basket with mushrooms that had been left unpicked under the hornbeams during the collections. Some specimens were as perfect as drawings, the older mushrooms blackened by the wait, but still edible. She knelt by the strawberry patch to show me how she teaches her grandsons to tell them apart.  ‚ÄúThe bad strawberries, they‚Äôre not poisonous, but you don‚Äôt eat them, they‚Äôre not good, and you can tell which ones they are because they have their heads up,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut the good ones‚Äîlook, they have their heads down.‚Äù   Joan Juliet Buck‚Äôs memoir,   The Price of Illusion, is out in paperback.

 üî•üî•üî• Cara Delevingne strips down for Balmain's Spring 2019 campaign and recreates Janet Jackson's iconic topless photo with creative director, Olivier Rousteing. One shot in the black-and-white series, where the duo poses topless, shows Rousteing with his hands over the British model's breasts, mimicking Jackson's janet album art and Rolling Stone cover shot by Patrick Demarchelier in 1993.  "It references all the iconic album covers of the Nineties, which were big pop culture moments of our childhood," the Rousteing said of the tribute, shot by Dan Beleiu, to WWD.  But the provocative portrait did more than pay homage to the '90s golden era of music. "The campaign shows the reunion of two skin tones, one black‚Äîor mixed race‚Äîand one white," Rousteing added to the outlet. ‚ÄúChoosing to pose naked was all about authenticity." He also noted that he wanted to create something "pure and transparent." Another photo shows Delevingne completely nude, sitting on a block in front of a large stone letter B‚ÄîPierre Balmain's original logo for his eponymous brand, which was revived last year.  As for choosing the Cara as his muse, Rousteing told WWD, "I love her so much that I don‚Äôt want to see any clothes on her. Her gaze is so strong and magnetic, it‚Äôs nearly an item of clothing in itself." This isn't the first time the designer has tapped the Brit for Balmain. Last September, she returned to the runway to open his show at Paris Fashion, while lip syncing to Prince, much to the audience's surprise. 
 It was a star-studded lineup of models.  Fashion Month always brings out a star-studded list of attendees sitting front row. But for its Spring 2019 show at Milan Fashion Week, Dolce & Gabbana brought the real star power onto the runway with an A-list lineup of models.  Tapping an all-star cast, the Italian fashion house sent '90s supermodels Carla Bruni, Eva Herzigova, Helena Christensen, and Karen Elson down the catwalk along with Italian actresses Monica Bellucci and Isabella Rossellini (who walked the runway with her entire family and new baby grandson in tow).  There were appearances by models Emily Ratajkowski and Ashley Graham along with 70-year-old Maye Musk and 54-year-old Marpessa Hennink. There were even models from the British royal family, including Lady Kitty Spencer, the niece of Princess Diana, and Emma Thynn, Viscountess Weymouth, the first black viscountess in the United Kingdom. It all made for a diverse and inclusive casting in terms of age, race, and size.   Lady Kitty Spencer, who gained more attention after looking insanely chic at the royal wedding, is no stranger to the Dolce & Gabbana runway. The model has walked several shows before, previously sharing how emotional the experience was for her on Instagram.  Also making an unexpected runway appearance at D&G this season (to close the show alongside Karen Elson, no less) was Stevie Wonder's teenage son, Kailand Morris. Wonder cheered on his son from the front row (which, as you guessed, was also star-studded).  See all the celebrities who walked Dolce & Gabbana's Spring 2019 show below.

 Here's everything to know about BadGal RiRi's latest collection. When Rihanna does something, she goes all out‚Äìand her latest Fenty x Puma show was no different. The singer-turned-designer (-turned beauty mogul) debuted her fourth collection in collaboration with Puma at New York Fashion Week on Sunday night, following two seasons showing abroad in Paris. BadGal RiRi made a fitting return to NYFW (just a few days after launching her Fenty Beauty line) with real-life motorcyclists, pink sand dunes, and a range of sporty-chic apparel. Here, our favorite moments from Rihanna's latest runway spectacular. Yup, Rihanna kicked off the presentation with a bang. At the start of the show, the lights dimmed, mist fell from the ceiling, and stunt people came riding out on dirt bikes, flipping and jumping over pink sand dunes. The show was held at the Park Avenue Armory in Manhattan, where ceilings were luckily high enough to allow for the gravity-defying stunts.

Top models (both male and female) paraded around the pink sand dunes sporting the athletic-inspired collection, featuring jumpsuits, biker shorts, swimsuits, parkas, backpacks and more. This season's cyclist theme follows the school girl, Marie Antoinette, and goth-inspired themes of previous collections.   Rihanna's surprise (look up) at Fenty Puma #NYFW pic.twitter.com/UEHqFNwzuq  Cindy Crawford's teenage daughter was in the model roster for RiRi's runway. (She was tough to recognize behind those futuristic sunglasses.) This marks her third time walking at her first-ever fashion week, following Calvin Klein and Alexander Wang. The Victoria's Secret Angel walked the runway in a blue and white bodysuit and hot pink boots. Other notable names in the show included Joan Smalls, Slick Woods, Lexi Boling, Taylor Hill, Stella Maxwell, Adwoa Aboah, and Grace Elizabeth. BadGal RiRi knows how to make an entrance. After the finale, she rode in on the back of a motorcycle, driven by one of the stunt-riders and did a lap around the runway. Queen.

 It truly is the end of an era. Devastating news for Zac Posen fans this weekend. The designer has been forced to close up shop after failing to find new investors or a buyer for the business. A design favorite in the fashion world, Posen revealed to WWD that he had no choice but to shut down trading. Describing the news as "pretty intense" and "surreal," Posen told the publication, "My partners and I tried everything possible within our means to find solutions to keep it going. I have been trying to find the right strategic partners at this tough time in retail and in the industry. The clock ran out." Posen confirmed that both his namesake line, House of Z, and diffusion line Z Spoke, had shuttered. The "surprising and immediate" decision meant that employees of the company were given the news on Friday afternoon, with operations immediately ceasing across the brand. Posen has an impressive celebrity following, with stars such as SJP, Claire Danes, Deepika Padukone, Michelle Obama, Amal Clooney, and Katie Holmes regularly wearing his designs. He was even responsible for designing Princess Eugenie's second wedding gown, which she wore to her evening reception. As Posen told WWD, "It breaks my heart for my customer and the people who work for me."

 The models reflect on the importance of this year's all-black Pirelli calendar.  For the third year in a row, the Pirelli calendar traded in its formerly sexed-up images for a more meaningful, in-depth project. The 2018 calendar, photographed by Tim Walker, showcases an all-black cast of entertainers and models in an Alice in Wonderland-themed shoot, marking the first time since 1987 that the calendar featured exclusively black talent.  The star-studded cast includes Whoopi Goldberg, Lupita Nyong'o, Naomi Campbell, Sean "Diddy" Combs, RuPaul, Dijmon Hounsou, Adwoa Aboah, Slick Woods, and more. Starring front and center, however, are some of the fresher faces of the group‚ÄîDuckie Thot, who stars as Alice, and Thando Hopa, who appears alongside Whoopi Goldberg as The Princess of Hearts. Thot, who grew up in Australia, and Hopa, a black albino woman from South Africa, each had her own unique experience breaking into the fashion world‚Äîand each has some ideas about how the industry can become a better place for women of color. In a candid conversation about race, diversity, and the hurdles fashion still has to overcome, Thot and Hopa discuss the impact of this year's Pirelli calendar with BAZAAR.com.  Harper's BAZAAR: As black women, what does an all-black Pirelli calendar mean to you? Duckie Thot: For me, it‚Äôs such a dream come true. I‚Äôve always wanted to work with black people in fashion. Y0u don‚Äôt get that every day. Sometimes when I‚Äôm on set and I see more than one black person I get a little excited, but to see everyone black on set was a very special moment for me. Honestly, in this industry, it‚Äôs not really explored or acted upon to have all-black talent.  Thando Hopa: I appreciated the fact that there was so many walks of blackness that were represented. Not just in terms of shades, but in terms of straight hair, natural hair, dreads, and different experiences of blackness. Different representations were there. I think diversity doesn‚Äôt only mean diversity in terms of races; it means within blackness there‚Äôs diversity, and I think that really came out in this. I really appreciated that.  DT: I love that you said that because a lot of the time, even in black communities, people don‚Äôt understand that there is diversity in black culture. I‚Äôm a black woman but I‚Äôm born and raised in Australia and that‚Äôs a whole different experience that many people have not come across. So once you put all of us in a room‚Äîall from different countries, all raised different places, we‚Äôre all different shades, we all have different experiences as black people‚Äîto be able to bring that together and actually share our own experiences with each other and with the world is very important.  "Diversity doesn‚Äôt only mean diversity in terms of races, it means within blackness there‚Äôs diversity." ‚ÄîThando Hopa HB: Can you talk about working with such a star-studded cast? TH: It was surreal working with people who I could only reach from TV screens or pages of magazines before. What I‚Äôm about to say is a little underwhelming, but when you‚Äôre actually face to face with these people you realize how people are just... people. For me, what was really incredible was carrying the presence of what everyone on set has done and consolidating all that into one message. When you have those people who have done incredible things, they allow you to expand on that message because of their presence.  DT: I was just speechless. I think every time someone tries to ask me what it‚Äôs like or how I felt, I still don‚Äôt know the right answer. I can‚Äôt explain what it was like working alongside these people because like‚Ä¶ Whoopi Goldberg! I loved her when I was five years old. I loved watching Sister Act. These are people that I‚Äôve looked up to for a very long time and like Thando said, when they‚Äôre in front of you, you realize they are all just people. For me, you know Djimon [Hounsou], I love him, he‚Äôs such a great actor. He was someone I almost couldn‚Äôt control myself around. I was like, "Oh my gosh, you are so great!" He‚Äôs so cool, calm, and collected. He‚Äôs touched me and to be able to work with him is such an honor.  HB: Did you have any other starstruck moments while shooting this? TH: I have to be a little honest with you, I think everybody had an incredible presence, but I particularly connected with Whoopi. As a young woman who didn‚Äôt have an image that was conventional, I really respected and admired how she was so bold about not having a conventional image with regards to beauty, and how she was absolutely unapologetic about it. She embraced it. For me, she kind of became a particular archetype and I told her that. It was important for me to tell her that. I cannot take away the brilliance, the importance, and the magnitude of everybody there, but in terms of connection, Whoopi is the person I connected with most.  DT: I mean, it was everyone. That‚Äôs why this is so beautiful, everyone was hand-picked for their own reason and had their own special element. Everyone is so different in their own way and it is so great to be able to say I worked alongside them. Tim really made us all feel so comfortable with each other. It was such a natural environment. It was a one-in-a-billion experience. I know I‚Äôm always going to look back and think about that shoot over the four days we experienced it. We all got very close. It may have just been four days, but Thando and I were speaking on some heavy topics after shooting. It was being able to take what we were given on set and bringing it out in the real world. That for me is very memorable in itself.  ‚ÄúI want inclusivity to be normal. It‚Äôs not just in fashion, it‚Äôs being able to see representation of myself in general." ‚ÄîDuckie Thot HB: What changes are you hoping to see in the fashion industry in terms of inclusivity and diversity?  DT: I want it to be normal. Growing up in Australia, I didn‚Äôt understand why I didn‚Äôt see a reflection of myself in anything‚Äînot even on a book cover or a magazine cover. It‚Äôs not just in fashion, it's being able to see representation of myself in general. As a child, you need that. It determines quite a lot growing up. When you don‚Äôt see yourself, it‚Äôs almost like a piece of a puzzle is missing and you don‚Äôt understand why. I was born and raised in Australia and it was quite difficult for me. I never saw representation of myself and I always felt odd. One day I want a black girl in Australia to look at a magazine and be like, ‚ÄúOh!‚Äù  I still remember the day I decided I wanted to [model]. I was walking in a shopping center in Australia. I think I was 12‚Äîthat was when I really wanted to be in fashion. I was in one of the biggest shopping centers in Melbourne, it has maybe four or five levels, and I went around the WHOLE thing looking for a woman that looked like me and I did not find a single woman. It made me feel like there was some sort of responsibility I had to take and something that I had to do. Even though I was young at the time, I knew it wasn‚Äôt normal and I knew there was something that didn‚Äôt feel right. It‚Äôs understanding that there is a problem‚Äîand it‚Äôs not just in Australia, don‚Äôt think that at all. Diversity is a worldwide issue and it‚Äôs something that the world does not want to accept. Until we start taking responsibility for it, taking charging of it, and start doing things like this [the all-black Pirelli calendar], it‚Äôs not going to change. I think we took a massive step forward with the Pirelli calendar.    TH: In terms of looking different, I completely understand that. I mean, I look different from my parents and my sister. I did not look like anybody around me. Your parents will try to instill a sense of self-esteem into you and it‚Äôs limited because what you‚Äôre looking at in terms of television and magazines. That can make a sense of inadequacy sneak in even when you don‚Äôt realize it. It‚Äôs in your subconscious if you don‚Äôt look a particular way. We say "this is beautiful" and this image does not look like you. Then what happens is that you start feeling the pressure to look more like that image, that image that they say is beautiful. You start doing everything possible to conform to that image, because yours isn‚Äôt represented, therefore yours isn‚Äôt good enough.  I decided to start modeling when I was older. I was 23. I was already a prosecutor, so when I got scouted, I said, "Look, I‚Äôll only work on projects that are impact-driven, that can bring about a change in terms of perceptions of beauty." In terms of fashion in particular, and everything that we‚Äôre trying to do, I‚Äôd really like for fashion to get to a point where just because something isn‚Äôt sufficiently represented, it‚Äôs considered a "trend." So, "This thing is being represented and it wasn‚Äôt being represented before, so it must be a trend!" That diminishes the importance of what that is. That‚Äôs my issue. I think that kind of narrative needs to change. DT: One thousand percent! I‚Äôve experienced that and it‚Äôs so crazy. I remember we were shooting a few weeks ago and someone was like, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre doing a lot of work now, black is cool now!‚Äù And I was like, "Your mind is totally not in tune. You just don‚Äôt get it!" I didn‚Äôt even know how to respond to that because you can‚Äôt see past the trend. It was very difficult for me to even react to that because I was like, I can tell you so much, but how far am I even going to get with you? That mentality, especially with people in the fashion industry, needs to change. We‚Äôre here to stay. It‚Äôs not a trend. People are not a trend.  TH: The issue I have with that kind of narrative is that it‚Äôs almost saying ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not supposed to be here, so you‚Äôre just going to be there for a short time because you‚Äôre not the standard and you‚Äôre not it.‚Äù That‚Äôs my issue with saying something is a ‚Äútrend,‚Äù simply because it hasn't been represented in the media before. For you to start calling an image that people have in their every day life "a trend" only because of [it] being celebrated, then you‚Äôre saying, "There‚Äôs a standard and you‚Äôre not it.‚Äù See more of the 2018 Pirelli calendar here. 
 Ballet stars Misty Copeland, Isabella Boylston, and Tiler Peck slip into prefall‚Äôs dance-inspired fashion to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the classic film. It‚Äôs been 70 years since the premiere of The Red Shoes, the definitive dance film about ballet as obsession that follows a vivid trifecta of characters: a ballerina on the rise, an ambitious young composer, and an impresario, modeled after Ballets Russes founder Sergei Diaghilev, who stops at nothing to get his way. As for realism, does that even matter? In The Red Shoes, we are allowed, as the director Martin Scorsese has said, ‚Äúto witness an impression of a world,‚Äù if not the world itself. And as for obsessions, the film has long been one of Scorsese‚Äôs own. Written, directed, and produced by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger (known as the Archers), The Red Shoes won Oscars for art direction and original score. The film is a saturation of Technicolor, which in its most fantastical moments makes it seem as if the action could bleed out of the frame. It‚Äôs not just the vibrancy of the colors but the collective palette. Pause the screen, and there you have it: an instant painting.  The Red Shoes tells the story of a dancer, Vicky Page (played by the British ballerina Moira Shearer in her acting debut), who joins a ballet company run by the intense taskmaster Boris Lermontov (Anton Walbrook). She‚Äôs caught between two worlds and two desires: dance and love. Against Lermontov‚Äôs wishes, she falls for composer Julian Craster (Marius Goring), who has been commissioned by Lermontov to write the score for The Red Shoes, a ballet based on the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale that Vicky is to star in. In it‚Äîa fantastical, 15-minute set piece within the film‚Äîa young woman is offered a pair of ruby-red pointe shoes by a demonic shoemaker. She jumps right into the shoes and begins a gleeful dance through other realms. But she soon discovers that they possess her body: Her feet can‚Äôt stop, and in the end, the situation turns tragic, just as it does, in life, for Vicky.  Despite its over-the-top drama, the film delivers a surprisingly authentic portrayal of the ballet ethos. It has long been a favorite of Misty Copeland, the celebrated American Ballet Theatre principal dancer. ‚ÄúWatching The Red Shoes is like watching a ballet,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúJust like Swan Lake, it has stood the test of time. You don‚Äôt look at it and think, ‚ÄòOh, this was filmed in a certain time.‚Äô It‚Äôs like experiencing a live performance.‚Äù  In the portraits on these pages, three prized American ballerinas‚ÄîCopeland is joined by fellow ABT principal Isabella Boylston and New York City Ballet principal Tiler Peck‚Äîpay homage to the film in some of prefall‚Äôs red shoes and balletic dresses. Copeland, the first female African-American principal at ABT, is revered for her gifts as a dramatic ballerina; Boylston, who hails from Sun Valley, Idaho, brings a free-spirited joy to her invincible technique; and Peck, a California transplant who is as suited to works choreographed by George Balanchine as she is to those by Jerome Robbins, imbues her roles with natural theatricality. All three are performing with their respective companies at Lincoln Center this month. "It‚Äôs not just the vibrancy of the colors but the collective palette. Pause the screen, and there you have it: an instant painting."  Many dancers‚Äîespecially women‚Äîrecognize Vicky‚Äôs plight and the worlds she‚Äôs torn between. ‚ÄúWhen I was younger there were things in my home life that were difficult, so dancing was definitely my refuge,‚Äù says Boylston. ‚ÄúI just knew that I always had to dance one way or another.‚Äù For dancers, that‚Äôs a universal sentiment: When the impresario Lermontov asks Vicky why she wants to dance, she answers with a question: ‚ÄúWhy do you want to live?‚Äù Shearer may have been convincing as an actress in the film‚Äîher performance is actually the most understated of them all‚Äîbut she was first and foremost a dancer. When she delivers a line like that, we believe her conviction, her devotion. But something else is missing‚Äîand mercifully so. Part of the allure of The Red Shoes is Shearer: Ballet royalty, she exudes a quality that somehow magnifies Vicky‚Äôs grit and her vulnerability at once. Both qualities are inherent in a ballerina. It‚Äôs a hard, even brutal, existence; Boylston calls herself lucky for never having been sidelined for an extended period with an injury. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm always dancing with an injury,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt remember ever dancing without pain since I was a kid.‚Äù Earlier this year, Boylston was featured as Jennifer Lawrence‚Äôs dance double in the Francis Lawrence‚Äìdirected film Red Sparrow, a gritty thriller about a Bolshoi prima ballerina turned spy. The opening ballet, inspired by The Firebird, was created by New York City Ballet‚Äôs resident choreographer, Justin Peck (no relation to Tiler). Most important, Boylston wanted to work with him on a film. ‚ÄúUltimately I thought it would be such a unique and cool experience that I should just seize the opportunity, and I‚Äôm really glad I did,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIt was a chance to work with Justin and Jennifer and Francis, and to be on a set and see how it works, and also to share my dancing with a wider audience.‚Äù  Boylston says she believes the torture scenes in Red Sparrow are true to life. ‚ÄúA ballerina has endured so much pain, she‚Äôd be able to endure torture,‚Äù she explains. ‚ÄúMaybe that‚Äôs a bad comparison. But I feel like the toughness you need to be a ballerina at the top of your game would probably serve you really well as a spy.‚Äù  Discipline is another integral ingredient for a dancer, as one telling scene in The Red Shoes reveals. The morning after the premiere of the title ballet, Vicky prepares for her daily ritual: ballet class. The first to arrive at the studio, she stands at the barre in a button-down shirt tied in a knot above the waist and high-cut black briefs. After her triumph, she has rolled up her sleeves; she‚Äôs ready to work. Then and now, a dancer can‚Äôt afford to miss a day. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt really have a normal life,‚Äù says Tiler Peck. ‚ÄúI try to have as healthy a balance as possible, but your career is so short that if you don‚Äôt put it toward the front it could slip away from you. We finish our shows, and, yeah, we want to go out and have fun and meet people, but all we do is go home and take care of our bodies so we can perform at the highest level the next day.‚Äù "She jumps right into the shoes and begins a gleeful dance through other realms." But the women say that their sacrifices are well worth it. ‚ÄúThe older I get, the more I realize how vital ballet has been in shaping who I am,‚Äù says Copeland. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do this forever. And I feel like I‚Äôll have plenty of time to sleep in and travel and have amazing dinners out.‚Äù The Red Shoes is glittering, but it also shows that ballet isn‚Äôt all about glamour. In studio scenes, Vicky breaks into a sweat during rehearsals. Her curls turn frizzy. She doesn‚Äôt hide the exertion of trying to get a step right, and while she‚Äôs as finely boned as they come, with porcelain, almost translucent, skin, she‚Äôs neither fragile nor a waif. This is a woman choosing between art and love, and the clock is ticking. It was partly for that reason that Shearer was reluctant to play Vicky in the first place. As iconic as her performance was‚Äîthose red shoes, that red hair, the gowns, and, above all, her impeccable dancing‚Äîit took some convincing to sign the 21-year-old Sadler‚Äôs Wells ballerina. She didn‚Äôt want to interrupt her dance career.  But while the film made Shearer a legend, it‚Äôs her dancing that has allowed The Red Shoes to last. As soon as the ballet begins, the audience disappears, and the dancer‚Äôs perspective takes over. As the action leaves the proscenium and enters other realms, we experience Vicky‚Äôs journey viscerally: What is she feeling in her body? How does motion merge with feeling? It‚Äôs like being invited into the sacred space of a ballerina. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre very sensitive people,‚Äù Copeland says. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs such a fine line between being vulnerable onstage and not being too hard on ourselves. Maybe back then, dancers didn‚Äôt really have a grasp on that. It was like you gave everything to the art. You left it out on the stage.‚Äù This article originally appears in the May 2018 issue of Harper's Bazaar, available on newsstands April 24.

 Time is on your side, thanks to Audemars Piguet‚Äôs new Millenary Frosted Gold Philosophique watch. Though it‚Äôs easy enough to steal a glance at one of the all too many phones, pads, and computers surrounding us these days, wouldn‚Äôt you rather stay on schedule in style (and sans screen)?  Enter Audemars Piguet‚Äôs just-released New Millenary Frosted Gold Philosophique. The tantalizing timepiece has been micro-hammered and hand-finished by Audemars Piguet‚Äôs craftsmen at the manufacturer's headquarters nestled in the heart of the Swiss Jura. It‚Äôs in this idyllic locale that the Dutch influencer, Anouk Yve, spent a blissful day. A worthwhile investment needs to outlast any fleeting item du jour‚Äîand what‚Äôs more timeless than an expertly executed watch? Consider this 18-carat masterpiece a future heirloom to have and to hold now and down the line. The wristwatch is equipped with just a single sand-blasted hour hand to  encourage you to let go of the minutiae (and minutes) of your day-to-day. Here, see Yve set her own leisurely pace to indulge in the finer things in life, like fresh-out-of-the-oven pastries and a spot in the sun.  
  Paired with elevated essentials (a breezy button-down; the perfect camel-colored trousers; a pair of classic sunglasses), the chic watch will get you from point A to B on time and in tip-top form.  Take your pick from an 18-carat pink gold face finished with brown alligator straps, or perhaps you‚Äôd prefer it in white gold flanked by midnight-hued leather. Regardless of your personal style, the Philosophique will elevate your look.  Forget fingers stacked with precious stones and armfuls of embellished bangles. Finished with a sapphire cabochon and diamond-dust effect, this non-pareil accessory renders everything else slightly superfluous, while a crystal clear caseback flaunting the watch's colored plates of the oscillating weight‚Äîwatch the ultra sophisticated statement piece hard at work.  A perfect piece, for the perfect day.

 The busiest man in fashion ponders the meaning of artist Takashi Murakami‚Äôs latest creation. I love Murakami‚Äôs octopus character, Taco 7, because it‚Äôs just so funny. Although I‚Äôve never actually met Takashi, I think he‚Äôs a wonderful artist. And if he‚Äôs anything like what he expresses in his art, I‚Äôm sure we would get along.  But am I like his octopus that eats its own leg in order to survive? In some ways, I guess. I have survived in the world pretty well, but that is mostly because I‚Äôm lucky. I have lifelong contracts at two billion-dollar companies, Fendi and Chanel, which gives me a level of freedom that‚Äîlet‚Äôs be honest‚Äînobody else in fashion really has.  So I don‚Äôt have any sort of feeling that I need to survive; I don‚Äôt feel like life is a struggle.And who wants to hear about other people‚Äôs suffering anyway? If a designer suffers or not is nobody else‚Äôs business.We make fashion‚Äîsome-thing that‚Äôs supposed to make people happy. We‚Äôre not selling our problems or our personal dramas.  I‚Äôm often asked how I do what I do‚Äîhow I juggle so many things at the same time, like an octopus‚Äîbut it‚Äôs totally normal to me. In fact, I think maybe it‚Äôs other people who have the problem. Designers today, they get big very quickly, and then their heads get big too. Suddenly, they think they‚Äôre more important than their label, and that is just not true. I‚Äôve always known that I am me, and that Fendi is Fendi, that Chanel is Chanel. And so I‚Äôm very much against this trend of designers putting their names next to their labels. You know,‚Äúthis and this for that and that.‚Äù I don‚Äôt have to put my name next to Fendi or Chanel. If a collection is good, people will know who made it.  And if it‚Äôs not so good? Maybe it‚Äôs better that they don‚Äôt know. People should really think about these things.  Of course, I don‚Äôt have tentacles like an octopus, but if I did they would be my teams. I‚Äôm very nice to people I work with, which‚Äîespecially in fashion‚Äîis not always the case. But I can‚Äôt do what I do alone, and I need something from everybody. The only thing I know how to do is sketch and come up with a few ideas, but for the rest of it, I need help. Thankfully, I‚Äôm lucky to have the best‚Äînobody really leaves, and the two or three people that have tried have all come back. Most of them have never worked for anyone else:They started with me when they were 18, and now they‚Äôre 50. It‚Äôs quite funny how that happens. So my teams are very precious, like family.  "To me, freedom is the pinnacle of luxury." Admittedly, it probably doesn‚Äôt hurt that I‚Äôm very much into paying people well and hate people who don‚Äôt. I want everyone who works for me to have a nice, beautiful life, and‚Äîsorry!‚Äîa nice beautiful life is expensive. There might be a song that says, ‚ÄúThe best things in life are free,‚Äù but no. No, they are not. At Chanel I have a girl who has worked with me for nearly 30 years who is the go between with all the ateliers and the people who make embroidery. She is a huge help, and I have someone similar in every department‚Äîfor the handbags, the shoes, the jewelry, the leather, the jeans, all of it. I mostly work with girls, and if I‚Äôm not doing too many men‚Äôs collections, I prefer to have girls around me. I don‚Äôt know why that is, but it is. It would be too easy for me to be mean and talk badly to my employees. I wouldnever do that because it‚Äôs boring. In any case, I don‚Äôt ever have to get angry because they do things exactly the way I think they should be done. We‚Äôre all on the same wavelength.  Another way I am perhaps like an octopus is that I‚Äôm very curious. I want to knoweverything and see everything. The most important thing for me is having the freedomto explore ideas and try new things. I don‚Äôt even work for money anymore. To me, freedom is the pinnacle of luxury.  I‚Äôve had enough houses in my life. The place where I live in Paris, for instance, isvery, very nice, but nobody ever comes here. Only Choupette, my famous cat, my private secretary, my personal maid, and my cook, who brings the food, which is made in a house next door. That‚Äôs it.  To maintain my freedom I have a very special way of working. When I wake upeach morning‚Äîafter reading the newspapers, because one has to be informed‚Äîit‚Äôs up to me to decide when I sketch, when I don‚Äôt sketch, and what else I‚Äôm doing that day. Most days, I want to be alone. I‚Äôm a pretty good sketch artist, but on paper only, because I don‚Äôt use computers. In fact, I wanted to be an illustrator and a cartoonist when I was younger, which I still do once a month on my cartoon page in Germany‚Äôs biggest daily newspaper. My political ones are very mean. "The trick is to think beforehand about what you want to do, and how you want it to be done." A lot of my sketches go straight into the bin, but I think this is a healthy attitude to have. When I‚Äôm happy with one, I‚Äôll have it sent to the studio so they can print it out and start working right away. I include all of the technical details so my team hardly ever has to ask me any questions. I‚Äôm also very quick. I‚Äôm not standing around for hours asking myself if a button is right or not, like some other people do to try and justify their big salaries. I couldn‚Äôt do what I do if I were slow. I‚Äôm a perfectionist, but that doesn‚Äôt mean I have to take 100 hours to do something.  The trick is to think beforehand about what you want to do, and how you want it to be done, and then I always remember the famous line by Lady Mendl, from when she was an interior designer. When she did the interiors of what is now the Frick Collection, she presented her proposal to Mr. Frick, who said, ‚ÄúYes, it‚Äôs very good. I like it. Do you have another idea?‚Äù And she said, ‚ÄúNo! There is no second option!‚Äù It‚Äôs up to me to think about things and then present the final option. Like the Frank Sinatra song, I do it my way. I do all my sketching at home because in the studio there‚Äôs too much going on‚Äîtoomuch conversation, too many phone calls, too many people. I can‚Äôt concentrate. Athome, it‚Äôs just me and my sketch pad with Choupette sitting next to me. I don‚Äôt use references because it‚Äôs all in my mind. I have a very good visual memory‚Äîmaybe even photographic. I think it‚Äôs sad when designers are too much into the past, or get stuck in their own archive. Your job is not to remind people what you did. What‚Äôs important is what you‚Äôre doing right now.  I don‚Äôt do meetings, and wouldn‚Äôt do them for anything in the world. I never have andnever will. I don‚Äôt do any marketing things either, other than photograph the campaigns. Nobody tells me what to do, really. It wasn‚Äôt always like this for me, of course, but that‚Äôs how it has developed over the years. Back in my ChloeÃÅ days, the world was so different. I couldn‚Äôt have possibly worked this way 20 years ago. "If there is a secret to my success, it's that I have absolutely no problem with myself."  I wish I had some advice to give to the younger generation, but I don‚Äôt, other than to work hard and to find the right clients. Also, be careful not to overestimate yourself. Don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre more important than the brand. But everybody has to find his or her own way, and what works for me probably wouldn‚Äôt work for Alessandro Michele, who I think is great, or Jonathan Anderson.  If there is a secret to my success, it‚Äôs that I have absolutely no problem with myself. It‚Äôs almost like I have a kind of indifference as far as I‚Äôm concerned. I‚Äôm an expert at forgetting my problems, if that makes sense, and care more about other people‚Äôs. Who knows? Maybe I did once eat my own leg. There‚Äôs that wonderful Billie Holiday line,‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easy to remember but so hard to forget,‚Äù but for me, it‚Äôs reversed‚Äîthings are hard to remember and easy to forget. It‚Äôs a very funny and very pleasant way to live.  Production: CeÃÅline Guillerm for octopix.fr.  This article originally appears in the November 2017 issue of Harper's Bazaar.

 Hang these looks in the Louvre!!! Just days after Sasha Obama's high school graduation, the Obama family is celebrating with a well-dressed vacation through the South of France. And while it's no surprise the entire family is serving up some chic looks, it's Sasha and Malia who we're looking to for our Summer 2019 style inspiration.  While touring the Palais des Papes in Avignon on Father's Day, the Obama daughters each mastered the art of summer vacation style in their own ways. Sasha wore Reformation's snake-print slip dress, which she paired with white sneakers by Unif. Malia, meanwhile, went for a chic all-white look, styling a backless white halter top with white high-waisted pants, black lace-up sandals, and a red suede Mansur Gavriel bag for a pop of color.    Do you SEE these lewks?! Hang them in the Louvre, put them on the hundred dollar bill, in Sasha and Malia We Trust!!! Sasha's perfect summer outfit is still available to shop online‚Äîand her rose-adorned sneakers are also currently on sale.

 The combat trend is up to fifty percent off. Lug sole boots are cropping up as one of the biggest trends of the season (trust us, we asked the experts), but instead of reaching for classic Doc Martens or actual workwear brands, we're more inclined to buy designer duds. Those cult-worthy Bottega Veneta boots are still sold out everywhere, but we found some equally great options to sub-in for winter. From Valentino to The Row to Simon Miller, here are 12 pairs of combat boots that happen to be on major discount, courtesy of Net-A-Porter's massive sale. We know that it's the season of giving, but tell yourself that these shoes are practical and fifty percent off. You deserve it.

 Say hello to the chicest vending machine we've ever seen. Tiffany & Co. just introduced a novel to shop their iconic items: a vending machine. Located in the brand's recently opened London store, Tiffany & Co.'s latest shopping innovation lets visitors to purchase the new Tiffany & Co. fragrance from a Tiffany blue vending machine.  The Tiffany Style Studio, which launched earlier this month in London's Covent Garden, was designed to be an innovative retail space that offers a unique shopping experience. "We‚Äôve integrated uniquely playful displays that reflect the wit and humor of Tiffany design to create a one-of-a-kind, experiential destination," said Richard Moore, vice president, creative director of store design and creative visual merchandising at Tiffany & Co, according to Harper's Bazaar UK. The London store has Tiffany Blue wooden crates that display the brand's "Everyday Object" accessories. The location also has  a #MakeItTiffany personalization bar, which gives shoppers the chance to engrave symbols or monograms on select products. And you don't have to go across the pond to personalize your Tiffany items: there's a pop-up personalization space in Tiffany's Rockefeller Center location in New York, too.     The vending machine marks the latest innovation embraced by the storied brand. Earlier this year, Tiffany & Co. painted New York subway stations and taxis their signature shade of blue. The Insta-worthy occasion was created to celebrate the launch of Tiffany's new jewelry collection, Paper Flowers.  And last year, Tiffany opened their first ever dining concept in New York: the Tiffany Blue Box Caf√©. Tiffany fans can now dine in the all-day caf√©, which is very appropriately covered in Tiffany's iconic shade of blue. Plan your visit to Tiffany's Covent Garden Style studio here.

 The '70s-inspired collection is here to brighten up your winter wardrobe.  Coat season is upon us and just in time to brighten up your outerwear options, Diane von Furstenberg and Apparis joined forces for a collection of '70s-inspired faux fur coats.  The storied fashion house and rising vegan fur brand's first collaboration includes four coat styles‚Äîall of which fuse Apparis' classic styles with DVF's signature prints and colors. The end result? Bold, statement-making coats that won't make you dread bundling up this winter.  Offered in bright neon yellow, a colorful turquoise print, eggplant, and a neutral '70s print channeling DVF's founding decade, the collection's styles range from $345 - $470.  Along with many other leading fashion houses, Diane von Furstenberg announced it would officially be going fur free in 2018. That same year, Apparis launched its debut collection of cruelty-free, 100% vegan outerwear. And as many modern-day relationships, the two female-led brands first met on Instagram when DVF‚Äôs CEO, Sandra Campos, reached out to Apparis‚Äô founder, Lauren Nouchi, via DM. The rest, as they say, is history.   "DVF‚Äôs core purpose is to support women and fortunately, the brand is able to have established a platform to do so across several channels including partnerships. As a fellow female-led and female-founded business, Apparis has made vegan products chic," a statement from the brand read. "DVF banned the use of real fur in our products, therefore finding Apparis‚Äôs ethically sourced, bold and colorful jackets was the perfect match for this collaboration."  Dropping today, the DVF x Apparis collection is now available to shop at dvf.com and apparis.com.  
 The Harlem couturier is the face of the luxury label's men's tailoring ads Fret not, fashion folk: all is well between Gucci and Dapper Dan! The Italian brand has just tapped the Harlem fashion icon for its men‚Äôs tailoring campaign. Dan (real name Daniel Day) made a name for himself in the 1980s for his made-to-order designs that often re-appropriated logos from famous fashion houses. One of his most iconic pieces‚Äîa jacket with oversized sleeves featuring the Louis Vuitton logo‚Äîwas re-worked by Alessandro Michele for Gucci‚Äôs cruise 2018 collection with the interlocking Gucci logo. This set off a firestorm of debate in the fashion world as to whether or not Michele had copied Dan. But Michele insisted that it was an homage, and that he was a huge fan of Dapper Dan‚Äôs work. As such, he tapped the New Yorker to front the Glen Luchford-lensed ads, shot in Harlem. Dan is a great person to represent a men‚Äôs tailoring ‚Äî ‚Äúdapper‚Äù is his name, after all.  Furthermore, Dazed reports that Gucci and Dan are working together on a capsule collection that will hit stores in the spring, and that Dan has a new studio opening up utilizing raw materials from luxury brand. Of all the collaborations going on in fashion lately, this one might be the most exciting news yet.

 Get an inside look.  What's it like to be the Accessories Director of Harper's Bazaar at Fashion Week? Amanda Alagem takes us behind the scene, dashing from show to show, and appointments with top accessories designers‚Äîluckily, getting around in her Maserati car ensured she made it to everything on her schedule. From her Milanese outfits to previews of Spring 2018, click through for her fashion week diary.  The Spring shows are the best when there‚Äôs lingering summer sun. Landing in Milan to perfect weather, set the tone for a really upbeat and optimistic season. First show, Prada! Inside the Prada show I‚Äôm obsessed with all of the Prada comic book prints developed by famous comic artists from around the world. The views from the Rene Caovilla showroom in the center of the city are incredible ‚Äì you can get 360 views of the entire city! I always look forward to the Fendi show. The Fendi finale! Everything popped thanks to the blue hair.  The Gucci Hub houses the most incredible showroom and offices. Visiting really gives you a glimpse into the eccentric and amazing Gucci world! I‚Äôm obsessed with all of the menswear inspired looks for the season and was so excited to have the chance to test it finally! During shows, my car becomes my office. I always have copies of the schedule, invitations, water, snacks, extra battery packs and cell phone chargers ‚Äì everything I need to get me from 9 am ‚Äì midnight! In the frenzy outside the shows, its easy to get lost. My driver made sure that did not happen to us! There's nothing like a classic patent pump. We knew we were in for something good when we found out the Versace show would be a tribute to Gianni.  The Versace show was a true fashion moment. The show celebrated the incredible life and talents of Gianni Versace, with a finale that played tribute to his legacy. Naomi, Christy, Cindy, Carla and Helena closed the show, as George Michael‚Äôs Freedom played. It was a moment I will never forget. A kitten heel is the only way to go when running between appointments in Milan. Love seeing Kendall Jenner on the runway. Etro‚Äôs gorgeous moodboards! Max Mara always has the best models. I love how Halima is smiling here. A turtleneck and jeans is always an easy go-to during fashion week. 
 Wait, what?!  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. Bella Hadid is standing in an all-white space wearing nothing but a pair of black bike shoes, tonal crewneck T-shirt, and sneakers, all by Calvin Klein. As a deep blue filter fades into the screen, Bella tilts her head to the side, and an enigmatic shadow figure walks toward her. No, the other figure was not a recognizable CK face like male model Garrett Neff, nor was it a musician like A$AP Rocky and Shawn Mendes, both of whom are currently starring in the #MyCalvins campaign. Instead, it was Lil Miquela, an AI robot influencer.    Lil Miquela has an oddly large Instagram following (1.5 million), despite not actually being a human‚Äîwhich is likely how she finessed a fashion campaign that most real-life models could only dream of fronting.  As Hadid and the robot begin to full-on make out, the camera pulls back from their intimate moment while Hadid's voiceover says: "Life is about opening doors, creating new dreams, that you never knew could exist." Last week, the label released campaign videos and imagery featuring ten other influencers who embody the "I Speak My Truth in #MyCalvins" ethos of living a carefree and rebellious lifestyle. Amongst the roster is actor Noah Centino; rapper A$AP Rocky; model Kendall Jenner; musicians Shawn Mendes, Troye Sivan, Chika, and Billie Eilish; actors Indya Moore and Yoo Ah-In; and BROCKHAMPTON's Kevin Abstract. 
 The brand pulled out all the stops for its first Pre-Fall show.  On what would have been the late Gianni Versace's 72nd birthday, the Italian fashion house ventured across seas to New York for its first-ever Pre-Fall show.  Held at the American Stock Exchange Building, the runway was a conglomeration of New York-inspired looks doused with revivals of some of Versace's most iconic dresses.  Looking back to the Versace archives, Donatella reworked some of the brand's most famous '90s collections into new styles and silhouettes. Most notable amongst those was the Versace dress Jennifer Lopez wore to the 2000 Grammys. Serving as the grand finale to the Pre-Fall 2019 show, Versace reissued the iconic gown in a new heart pattern. The look was worn by Amber Valetta, who also modeled the original design on the runway back in 1999 before it was made famous by JLo.  But that wasn't the only iconic Versace dress to make a comeback during the show. The brand also revisited its memorable safety pin collection from Spring 1994, which gave us the iconic safety pin gown worn by Elizabeth Hurley on the red carpet that same year. Revisiting the famous style, Versace reimagined the dress in an updated one-sleeved style on the Pre-Fall '19 runway.   While the show was clearly a nod to the legacy and nostalgia of Versace's greatest moments, its New York location was also meant to be a celebration of freedom and empowerment, according to Donatella's Instagram. Aside from a few "I Love NY" T-shirts, this was also evident by the powerful finale which took place around a giant sculpture of the Statue of Liberty's torch.   What a finale! THANK YOU so much to all the people who contributed to yesterday‚Äôs show! #VersaceNY A post shared by  Donatella Versace (@donatella_versace) on Dec 3, 2018 at 6:18am PST And Gigi Hadid carrying a mini version of said torch, of course.  From Gigi‚Äôs fittings... Now that‚Äôs a statue of the liberty!! üòò‚ù§Ô∏èüóΩ@gigihadid #versaceny #gigihadid A post shared by  Donatella Versace (@donatella_versace) on Dec 3, 2018 at 8:06am PST Despite being held on a rainy Sunday night, the event delivered a star-studded front row filled with A-listers like Lupita Nyong'o, Ciara, Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, and more. Leave it to Donatella to make the biggest of splashes with her first-ever New York fashion show.  
 The first launch includes pieces from Stella McCartney, Peony, Veja, and more.

"Our sustainable edit provides our customers with the knowledge they need, understanding that they can trust that these brands have been carefully reviewed and meet our criteria for inclusion. Our aim is to give a voice to the brands that are truly making positive changes by providing them with a platform to highlight their best practice.‚Äù  WELCOME TO #NETSUSTAIN: Our platform for considered, authentic and innovative brands, products and content ‚Äì a celebration of creativity that's driven by a desire to make fashion more sustainable.  @motherofpearl focuses on traceability across their entire supply chain ‚Äì designer @amy_powney is committed to sourcing more sustainable fibres for her collections.

 Kendall, Bella, and Alessandra are taking notes from Aaliyah... There is hardly a '90s era trend that supermodels and Instagram stars aren't willing to co-opt. You can hardly go a day without seeing Bella Hadid in a bustier top and mom jeans that would have looked de rigueur on Cindy Crawford in '94. Or Kendall Jenner in a slip dress that would have caught 22-year old Kate Moss' eye.     While pastel Versace tees, plaid Clueless suits and I.AM.GIA cargo pants are all perfectly on-trend '90s throwbacks, they're all a rather expensive entree into stylish time travel. Enter: the ribbed white tee, the ideal way to allow you to look like a CK One model without sacrificing your 401K.  Au Revoir Paris ... A post shared by  Alessandra Ambrosio (@alessandraambrosio) on Oct 4, 2018 at 12:47pm PDT  The unofficial uniform of '90s hip hop artists and underage Calvin Klein models can be yours at a jaw-dropping $5 or less. Since there's basically nothing Aaliyah wore in '99 that we don't want to wear now, consider us on board. (Side note: have you seen that insanely good red bakerboy hat in the Rock the Boat video recently?, but we digress).  Bella and Kendall are wearing theirs with snakeskin pants, and light wash denim respectively. Alessandra Ambrosio is pairing hers with jeans and a Magda Butrym coat that would make the Spice Girls zigazig ah. And at only $5 a pop, it seems like a good idea to give yours a quick trim if you're in a belly-bearing mood. I made the investment recently and paired mine with a black Chloe suit to dress it down. It added a little edge to the horse-print in a way a white blouse could not and served as the perfect backdrop to my layered gold chains. I wore another one the next day that I had cut with jeans and an oversized Tibi blazer. Who doesn't love a versatile piece that comes in at less than your coconut milk cappuccino?
 The French designer created the iconic bandage dress. Herv√© L. Leroux, creator of the bandage dress and founder of Herv√© Leger, has passed away at 60 years old. The F√©d√©ration de la Haute Couture et de la Mode announced his death today.  The French fashion designer met Karl Lagerfeld in the early '80s, and worked as his assistant at Fendi and Chanel before launching Herv√© Leger in 1985. It was here that he created the bandage dress, a bodycon silhouette that launched his brand into international fame, as models and celebrities sported the design through the '90s and 2000s. A 1993 runway review called the dresses Leroux's "specialty," describing them as as "elastic strips of fabric sewn together to make girdle-tight dresses" and even nicknamed them "the sexy mummy look." Even with his own label, Leroux still continued to work as a freelance designer for Lanvin and designed accessories for labels like Swarovski, according to his official bio. He also notably designed stage and ballet costumes through the '90s and made ready-to-wear, swimwear and hosiery for Wolford at the end of the decade. In 1999, BCBG Max Azria acquired the Herv√© Leger brand and Leroux lost the commercial rights to his name. However, he continued designing dresses for celebrities like Cate Blanchett, Taylor Swift and Jessica Chastain.  His longtime client Dita Von Teese posted a heartfelt tribute to the designer on Instagram today. "He made the most exquisite dresses that showcased a woman‚Äôs beauty, rather than distracting from it," she wrote.  Very sad that we are forced to say farewell to the genius @hervelegerleroux. I‚Äôm so grateful to have called him my friend after being introduced as ‚Äúthe ultimate‚Äù  by @suzannevonaichinger and @alimahdaviparis. He made the most exquisite dresses that showcased a woman‚Äôs beauty, rather than distracting from it. I‚Äôll always treasure my afternoons in his atelier just next to @maisonladuree, trying on dress after dress, really just for the fun of it. Herv√© would exclaim ‚ÄúTHIS dress, this dress is for YOU!‚Äù ...and occasionally, ‚Äú...non, not this one. NEXT!!‚Äù We would have the best time, I honestly could have only ever worn his dresses. @hervelegerleroux IS Herve L√©ger (he had to change his name and start over) and he is the inventor and only true master of the iconic bandage dress. And I‚Äôd say he was the only dressmaker that could accomplish a truly modern Madame Gr√®s goddess gown. I loved him for his wit, his candor, his sublime elegance and of course, his talent, which, came from authentic obsession, with no care for the commerciality of fashion. I‚Äôm so sad to see him go, and so abruptly. We‚Äôve lost one of the fashion greats. My heart breaks for his constant companion, our dear Jocelyn @hervelegersister Thank you, Dear Herv√©, for all of it. Rest in glamour, you‚Äôll never be forgotten. #herveleger #herveleroux A post shared by  üíÑDita Von Teese (@ditavonteese) on Oct 5, 2017 at 9:11pm PDT The designer opened a new label (with a Parisian boutique) under his own name, Herv√© L. Leroux, in 2000. Under this line, the couturier founded a new dress staple, the draped jersey dress‚Äîan elegant departure from the skin-tight silhouette of the bandage dress. He entered the couture calendar in 2013.

 The legendary designer was 85 years old.  Karl Lagerfeld, one of the most prolific designers of our time, has passed away in Paris. He was 85 years old. Chanel announced the news to The New York Times. However, the cause of the designer's death has not yet been confirmed.  Lagerfeld has had a legendary career spanning seven decades as a fashion designer and creative director. He created legacies simultaneously at the house of Chanel, launched ready-to-wear for celebrated Italian brand Fendi, and created a his own namesake collection.    "It is with deep sadness that the house of Chanel announces the passing of Karl Lagerfeld," the French brand said in a statement to WWD, citing Lagerfeld's talents as a designer and photographer. "The house of Chanel benefited from his talent for all the branding campaigns related to fashion since 1987. Finally, one cannot refer to Karl Lagerfeld without mentioning his innate sense of repartee and self-mockery." Chanel also added that Virginie Viard, Lagerfeld's right-hand and close collaborator for about 30 years, will take over creative work at the brand "so that the legacy of Gabrielle Chanel and Karl Lagerfeld can live on," according to CEO Alain Wertheimer.  News of Lagerfeld's death comes after he was noticeably absent from the Chanel haute couture shows in Paris last month. Despite rumors that Lagerfeld was in poor health, the French fashion house said he "was feeling tired" in a statement. Viard stepped in for Lagerfeld and took the final bow at the time.  The Hamburg, Germany native began his career in fashion as Pierre Balmain's assistant in 1955. He found success at Chlo√© in the mid 1960s, started designing for Fendi in 1965, and took the helm at Chanel in 1983 (about 12 years after Coco Chanel died in 1971).  When he took the job at Chanel, the brand was reportedly on its way out. "Everybody said, ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt touch it, it‚Äôs dead, it will never come back.‚Äô But by then I thought it was a challenge," he told The New Yorker.   Lagerfeld is credited with modernizing the legendary French brand, glamorizing its tweed suits and helping it appeal to a younger audience. During his tenure, faces of Chanel included It girls like Cara Delevingne, Lily-Rose Depp (daughter of Vanessa Paradis and Johnny Depp), and Kaia Gerber (Cindy Crawford‚Äôs daughter).  "Yes, the old Coco would have been shocked by a lot of things I did," Lagerfeld told Harper‚Äôs BAZAAR in 2013, the year of Chanel‚Äôs 100th anniversary. "But I had to do it, to keep the label in time with the times. Without it, Chanel would not be modern." In addition to his designs and sharp humor, Lagerfeld was known for his iconic look: a low ponytail, oversized sunglasses, and a black and white suit. Sometimes he was even accompanied by his famous beloved cat, Choupette. "I am like a caricature of myself, and I like that,‚Äù the designer has said, according to The New York Times. ‚ÄúIt is like a mask. And for me the Carnival of Venice lasts all year long.‚Äù This post has been updated.
 Swimsuit model turned runway It girl Hannah Ferguson is ready to make a splash.   Model Hannah Ferguson had no qualms about hopping on a camel for her Bazaar shoot in Tangier, Morocco. ‚ÄúI grew up on a farm riding horses, so it came naturally to me,‚Äù says the Texas native.  In fact, horses weren‚Äôt the only animals she knew her way around as a kid: ‚ÄúMy siblings and I took care of sheep, goats, turkeys, ducks, geese, dogs, and cats. Sometimes we had to milk the goats so their udders wouldn‚Äôt crack from all the pressure.‚Äù  "I‚Äôm not your typical stick-thin runway model."  Grace under fire clearly comes easily to the 25-year-old, who got her big break modeling for Sports Illustrated in 2014 wearing nothing but body paint.  Last year, Ferguson made the leap to high fashion, walking in powerhouse shows like Marc Jacobs and Dolce & Gabbana. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not your typical stick-thin runway model,‚Äù she adds. ‚ÄúThankfully the industry is more accepting of different body types these days.‚Äù   Lead image: Karl Lagerfeld Paris jumpsuit; Dianora Salviati scarf; Jimmy Choo sandals; Hair: Martin Cullen; Makeup: Satoko Watanabe; Production: Natalie Stranescu for Rosco Production.
 Do you SEE these walks?  While you were spending your Sunday afternoon relaxing, Dame Helen Mirren and Queen Jane Fonda were busy inventing a little something called the runway walk at Paris Fashion Week.  Both women were part of L'Oreal's first runway show which took place along the Champs-√âlys√©es in Paris. The inclusive runway featured a mass lineup of A-listers and supermodels including Doutzen Kroes, Iskra Lawrence, Irina Shayk, Cheryl Cole and more. But it was the two icons in their seventies who stole the show.  First, Mirren hit the runway like a total boss‚Äîwhipping her walking stick around, as one does while completely owning the place:  I mean, do you SEE that strut?  Then Fonda, who turns 80 this December, emerged in a floor-length animal print gown and diamond choker (I repeat: she turns 80 this December). The icon threw up some peace signs, blew a few kisses and worked the crowd like the pro she is.  After the show, the two actresses then posed together for the ultimate photo op.  Can you say runway royalty?

 The Gen Z icon discusses her famous parents, new film, and growing up both French and American In the new issue of CR Fashion Book, now on newsstands, editor-in-chief Carine Roitfeld time travels back to the year 1999, when she remembers fashion being at its most exciting and free. "1999 is about a spirit of independence, and there are very few independent thinkers left today," says Roitfeld. "I think right now a lot of people are looking back to this period of time. Not only to find references or get ideas, but to see who they were‚Äîhow good they were‚Äîand hopefully see who they can be again.‚Äù When it came time to choose a cover star for her 1999-themed issue, Roitfeld chose Lily-Rose Depp, a budding supermodel and actress‚Äïwho happened to be born in 1999.  Before stepping into Steven Klein's studio for her CR cover shoot, Depp had never seen the photos Klein once took of her mother Vanessa Paradis‚Äïthe iconic French singer-actress and fashion muse‚Äïat about the same age Depp is now, 18. Those smoldering Klein images of Paradis served as inspiration for this shoot.  "A lot of people think I‚Äôm only acting because of my dad. I'm not just doing it because it runs in the family."  Depp's career is clearly following the same, fast-rising trajectory as her mother's. Paradis had a hit song and starred in Chanel No. 5 ads as a teenager. Depp has since become the youngest-ever face of the same classic fragrance, and is now a runway regular at Chanel, too. But despite her fashion cred, Depp isn't stopping there. She stars alongside Natalie Portman in the new indie drama, Planetarium, in which they play fortune-teller sisters. For the new issue of CR, Portman spoke with Depp about classic films, early bedtimes, and their mutual Francophilia.  NATALIE PORTMAN: I heard that your photoshoot for CR was really special. LILY-ROSE DEPP: I love working with Carine. She actually styled the first shoot that I did for Chanel when I was 15. This time I got to show a little more skin and be a little more sexy. I had just turned 18, so I was ready to up the ante.  NP: Explain the connection to the photographs of your mom. LRD: Steven Klein had shot these amazing photographs of my mom when she was around my age. We shot in front of a mirror with the pictures taped to it. I have a similar grungy look. NP: Growing up, what was it like having both the French and the American sides to your family? LRD: Weirdly enough, I feel pretty connected to both cultures. I can seem fully French when I‚Äôm in France or totally like a Valley girl when I‚Äôm in L.A. [Laughs] NP: It‚Äôs so impressive to be able to act in two languages. LRD: The movie I‚Äôm shooting in September is my first in French. I‚Äôm the main character and I‚Äôm speaking in French the whole time, so I‚Äôm really nervous. When I talk fast in French I tend to stumble on my words a lot, so I have to work on that. NP: What movies have left the deepest impression on you?  LRD: I grew up watching films like Gone with the Wind and Bringing Up Baby. I think it‚Äôs really important to show kids these incredible classic movies from a young age. All global cultures are melding into this one social- media culture, and I think that these movies are a special way to preserve a specific point in time. NP: What are the big cultural differences between France and the United States? LRD: There‚Äôs something more personable in Europe than there is here. In the States, there‚Äôs more of a facade that I see people putting on. For me, the French culture is richer. It‚Äôs also easy to prefer Europe given the present state of things. I would have been nicer to America a year ago. The way politics is going, it‚Äôs hard for me to sit down and point out all the things that I love about America. NP: You didn‚Äôt get to vote in this last election, did you?  LRD: No, I just missed it. NP: That‚Äôs got to be really frustrating to feel like you didn‚Äôt even get to have a say. LRD: It was really frustrating. Of course I‚Äôm not even seeing the half of it. I‚Äôm not feeling the effects that so many other people are feeling. I can‚Äôt even imagine actually living it and feeling these changes. NP: Do you feel like it affects the kind of projects you want to do in any way? LRD: I do and I don‚Äôt. Not in the sense that I want to do politically charged things. Just in the sense that we should be doing things that are even more daring and even more out- there. Art is the most amazing distraction and now is when we need it the most in order to bring some life back into life. NP: Are you making any more American movies? LRD: I haven‚Äôt done an American movie since my first movie ever. The last two things I did were Planetarium and The Dancer, which were both French productions, and then the one that I‚Äôm about to do is a French production. NP: I feel like there‚Äôs a lot more interesting options in French movies right now. LRD: French scripts have a certain sensibility to them, with the writing style and the depth that the characters have. I like movies that make you think and then talk afterward. I like movies that spark your imagination and your curiosity and I find that the kind of depth that French scripts and characters have often leads to that. NP: Tell me what you‚Äôre doing in your spare time right now. LRD: I‚Äôm such a homebody. I feel like this is the age that everyone is going out to clubs. I like to hang out with my friends and watch movies and cooking shows. I cook a lot. NP: I would be very happy if I were your mother. I remember we‚Äôd, like, be out partying during Planetarium and you‚Äôd always say, ‚ÄúOkay, it‚Äôs time for me to go home now.‚Äù  LRD: People have this perception of 18-year-olds never sleeping and having so much energy, but I get tired at 9:30PM. I can‚Äôt even go to the movies after 8PM without falling asleep. NP: In Planetarium you play this spiritualist who is very in touch with ghosts. I always thought you were going to pass out from getting so into the s√©ance scenes.  LRD: I felt like I was going to pass out, too, but I think that was important. It would have been good for the scene. NP: One of the days that you did those scenes you were actually really sick with a stomach virus. LRD: I was not about to go home. I was the youngest one on set and it was my first really serious movie. NP: You don‚Äôt like to let anybody down. LRD: A lot of people think I‚Äôm only acting because of my dad, that I have not had to work as hard to be seen or recognized in the industry, so I think because of that it makes me want to work twice as hard to prove to everyone that I‚Äôm not just doing this because it‚Äôs easy to do. I‚Äôm not just doing it because it runs in the family. For the full Lily-Rose Depp editorial, check out the new, 1999-themed issue of CR Fashion Book

 Starting November 18, RTR customers can drop off their rentals at 30 Nordstrom locations. Something new is brewing between Rent the Runway and Nordstrom. The two luxury retail giants are planning to expand their partnership later this month, in which Rent the Runway will increase their Drop-Off Box Network from five to 30 Nordstrom locations nationwide, giving members more options for a seamless rental return experience. In addition to that, members will also be able to access exclusive services from Nordstrom, including styling and gift wrapping, both of which come just in time for the busy holiday season. This expansion, which will officially arrive by November 18, can be found in cities like Los Angeles, Nashville, Seattle, and Chicago. ‚ÄúThe expansion of our partnership helps us better serve our customers through innovation around products and experiences," said Jamie Nordstrom, president of Nordstrom.  Them: love what you‚Äôre wearing! You: üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è A post shared by  Rent the Runway (@renttherunway) on Nov 12, 2019 at 4:00pm PST Nordstrom will also become a platform partner with Rent the Runway, in which they will contribute inventory to the e-commerce retailer in order to extend the lifecycle of their own collections. Together, the companies will additionally study ways to provide customers with exclusive products that would be available to either rent or purchase. ‚ÄúWe are thrilled to be expanding our partnership with Nordstrom, the company known and respected for their unparalleled commitment to deliver world-class service and experience," said Rent the Runway CEO and co-founder Jenn Hyman. "We have seen a massive consumer behavior shift unfold over the past several years, with our community now relying on Rent the Runway as a near daily utility.  As our business has grown, we‚Äôve seen unparalleled demand for physical experiences including the convenience of Drop-Off Boxes."
 We chatted with the supermodel about staying zen and personal style amid the hustle and bustle of NYC. After a few weeks of rest, Bella Hadid was back to work again yesterday. The supermodel-in-the-making was about to see her biggest billboard yet, starring in her first jewelry campaign for Bvlgari, the brand she's been working with for over a year. First it was the Serpenti handbags, then the Bvlgari Goldea: The Roman Night fragrance and now she's the face of the B.Zero1 collection.  From the penthouse suite of the W Hotel Times Square, the 21-year old was decked out in leather pants and a vintage Vivienne Westwood top, getting ready to face the rain to see her face light up Times Square.  With New York Fashion Week and Valentine's Day looming, we chatted with Hadid about staying sane during this hectic time of year, her ideal date, and how she expresses herself through personal style.  A friendship bracelet my sister Gigi made me. I'm like we're not friends we're sisters [laughs] but she used to really love making them, and I kept them all.  It's huge! I love working with brands that I have faith in, that I love and I really want to wear myself. This collection is so me, and it's things I would wear everyday. You can stack the jewelry, and it's perfect for any occasion. It's just another amazing opportunity. I don't think I've had a billboard this big, and in Times Square. I heard there's a local singles spot in Times Square [laughs]. My ideal day would be an  adventurous day, and dinner‚Äîbut I also want a good breakfast. For dinner, a nice steak and fries, or even just saying in and having pizza.  üòçüòçüòç A post shared by  Libragrl999ü¶ã (@bellahadid) on Feb 28, 2017 at 2:55pm PST It's crazy, I feel like I've done so much, and I've worked a lot‚Äîbut I still have so much to do, so many things to check off my bucket list. I think I have a lot to do with the American fashion magazines, like Harper's Bazaar. A lot of artistic things I want to do, it's not always about how many editorials you can get.  It's about working with photographers that have the same eye as I do. Not so much about the fashion even, but the real artistic side. I love makeup and turning myself into different characters. I'm really inspired by art, film, photography.  When we're on set, I always find myself figuring out hair/makeup with the team, and we'll pull up all these ideas. I have so much inspiration on my phone. When I get to set I already know what exactly the mood board is, what kind of lighting the photographer is working with. So, it ends up feeling like a team art piece. I think it's fun for everyone that way, that we all get to express ourselves.  I went through a lot last year with my schedule. It's hard to travel so much, last year I was traveling if not every day, most every other day. I like to focus on staying within my own power, keeping my poise, using essential oils and crystals. Amythest is my favorite crystal. I just got a new one, I forgot the name but it's gorgeous, it's for stabilizing energy and bringing out the power within yourself. I'm stressed out that I don't have them with me right now [laughs]. I had my crystals in my bag last night, and I brought them into my bed and so now they're still sleeping. With the amount of people we're always working with, I need to keep myself zen. If I'm panicking, then people around me can see that, and then everybody panics, and that's the last thing I want to happen. I meditate a lot. I used to meditate almost every night before I went to sleep. If I'm not putting my energy into fully meditating, then I just listen to meditation music to sleep. I know all my music meditation playlist by heart now though. I know exactly when the second song starts, I'll fall asleep.   Back2work Milan  Before opening @dsquared2 show yesterday Biggggg big love to the amazing, generous, loving, Incredible Dean& Dan Thank you for an amazing day & Nightüñ§üñ§üñ§ A post shared by  Libragrl999ü¶ã (@bellahadid) on Jan 15, 2018 at 10:35pm PST My stylist Elizabeth [Sulcer] and I work together, but she's also very busy‚Äîso a lot of times I put my own outfits together. It's what makes me the most happy about fashion, making my own looks.  Even when I was a kid in high school, style was always my thing. I never wore flip-flops, I always had my cute outfits, I went vintage shopping. I never bought designer fashion until I could actually afford it when I turned 18. So I had to find the cheapest, but cutest things. My sister Alana once bought me this major Betsey Johnson lace and plaid skirt‚Äîit was the love of my life. I had all my doc martins‚ÄîI had style. And I'm so fortunate now I have my designer pieces‚Äîlike I'll buy a Balenciaga coat and I'll pair it with something vintage.  What I think is so fun about fashion is being able to do whatever you want. Now I'm at the point where, yeah, I'd wear an orange, red, yellow and black fanny pack‚Äîif that's what makes me happy‚Äî I shouldn't care. If I had more time, I would do it myself all the time. But Elizabeth and I work really well together, and it's both of us finding looks for me, and putting our own spin together as a team.  It's crazy because I  was never one to put outfits together for people to see me, but now of course I walk outside and photographers are outside my apartment. So now it's a fun thing. I look at it, instead of being like f‚Äî this, I can show what I'm really made of. 
 The supermodel opens her little black book of fashion.   "I buy vintage everywhere,‚Äù says Kate Moss. ‚ÄúI always keep my eyes open when I‚Äôm traveling.‚Äù It‚Äôs no surprise, then, that on a trip to South America the 45-year-old supermodel found a kindred spirit in Jorge Yarur Bascu√±√°n, director of the world-class Museo de la Moda in Santiago, Chile.   This month, Rizzoli is publishing Musings on Fashion and Style: Museo de la Moda, an irreverent scrapbook of sorts that Moss edited and that places the fashion museum‚Äôs encyclopedic holdings‚Äîwhere John Lennon‚Äôs Sgt. Pepper‚Äôs jacket and 1930s tea dresses rub up against the finest couture‚Äîin conversation with her wardrobe. Here, she shares her shopping tips and styling tricks for six key vintage styles from the museum‚Äôs collection with Bazaar.  It's lovely to know that I have a museum piece in the Thea Porter dress I own, but I just enjoy wearing it. I get excited whenever I find British designers from the 1960s and ‚Äô70s in a vintage shop, and I usually buy them. My daughter, Lila, just wore an Ossie Clark dress that I got at auction when she was 10 and had been saving for her. It once belonged to Twiggy. I chose this dress, as I love Bob Mackie and I think what he did with Cher was amazing. I have always gravitated toward bias-cut dresses because they are easy and comfortable but also really flattering and glamorous. I wore a 1930s silk dress to Princess Eugenie‚Äôs wedding reception. When I was a teenager, I wore bias-cut dresses with trainers, but now I wear heels.   The detailing in the way goddess dresses like the Jean Dess√®s gown in the museum‚Äôs collection are made is incredible. They are good to wear, since draping gives you a great body shape. This champagne jumpsuit, which I wore for Mo√´t & Chandon‚Äôs 150th anniversary, was perfect for that event. I kept the accessories really simple, as it didn‚Äôt need overstyling.  The  museum  has  a lot of 1930s tea dresses, and Jorge actually  gave  me  one from his collection.  They‚Äôre  very  feminine‚Äîperfect for a garden party. I usually accessorize with a sandal, a  small  handbag,  and  delicate  jewelry, maybe a dangly earring. I like the dreaminess of these dresses; the soft, flowing fabric. I always imagine someone wearing this dress as they waft around a Parisian garden or a stately home. It‚Äôs incredible to touch pieces worn by John Lennon and Jimi Hendrix, as they‚Äôre two of my favorite people who ever lived. A studded moto like my 1970s Roncelli jacket is the type of thing I like to wear to festivals or just every day to rock up a look and give it a bit of an edge. Yves Saint Laurent designs from the 1960s epitomize bohemian chic and are from an era I would have loved to live in. When I shop for peasant dresses, I really don‚Äôt look at labels; I‚Äôm usually drawn by the colors. I like to wear them with heeled boots.  Shop at Kate's Favorite Vintage StoresMy favorite place in London is Rellik; I‚Äôve been going there since it opened. And, of course, the weekend Portobello Green Market is always good. In New York, I love Resurrection, and in Paris, Didier Ludot has the most gorgeous couture pieces. 
 And a portion of its proceeds go to a good cause.  From Matrix-inspired shades to colored lenses, it's been a year of throwback, once-taboo sunglasses trends coming back in style. While we've already been inundated with ultra-small specs, Westward Leaning is bringing back another retro sunglass trend that's sure to be approved by every Cool Girl on Instagram: sporty shades. The brand launched a new line of high performance, active sunglasses aptly called Westward Leaning Sport. Featuring three sunglass frames (offered in a range of colors) and a pair of swim goggles, the new collection is designed to be sweat-proof, comfortable, and resistant to slippage‚Äîmaking it ideal for runners, swimmers, and of course, selfie fiends.    The angular, sporty shades are practically begging to be worn by Gigi and Bella Hadid‚Äîalong with just about every other cool girl on your Instagram feed. And let's not miss the fact that the designs subtly pay nod to the colorful shield sunglasses worn by the likes of Lil Kim and JLo back in the early 2000s. Available in shades of blue, pink, yellow, and clear, the frames range from $45 - $225.    From left: Westward Leaning Sport sunglasses, $225; $165; $225, SHOP To launch the new collection, the brand tapped influencers Aleali May and Jamie Chung as its official Sport ambassadors. Both women star in the campaign and have already rocked the shades on Instagram.  But the collection goes beyond just offering up some cool, unique sunglass options‚Äîthere's also a philanthropic component. For the line, Westward Leaning teamed up with Street Soccer USA's #LadiesFirst initiative, which helps empower underprivileged girls (age 6 - 18) through soccer. For every pair of Sport sunglasses purchased using the code 'LADIESFIRST' on westwardleaning.com, $25 will go to the official launch of #LadiesFirst. You may have never thought the sporty sunglasses your dad used to rock would ever, ever be cool, but here we are. Get ready for this trend to takeover the fashion set‚Äîwe're calling it now.

 We caught up with Kelly Zutrau and Joe Valle of indie pop band Wet in Brooklyn to talk about their new album, fashion obsessions, and what‚Äôs next for the duo‚Äîpresented by our partner, Gucci.  Take a melodic journey with Kelly Zutrau and Joe Valle of Brooklyn-based band Wet. In six years‚Äô time, the duo has experienced creative evolution while garnering a devoted following with their raw lyrics, soulful tunes, unforgettable live performances, and original style. With the release of their new album ‚ÄúStill Run,‚Äù an international tour in the works, and Gucci as a fan, there‚Äôs nothing stopping the band. How did the band start?KZ: Joe and I met in New York in 2007 or so and became friends. We started making music together in the summer of 2012 and slowly started putting songs up on the internet and playing shows, and then eventually we were signed to Columbia Records.   "I was trying to write my own version of the national anthem to make sense of what was going on."  What sets your music style apart from others?KZ: I'm interested in making music that can be nuanced and doesn't feel prescribed or too derivative, but is also accessible. I want to make something that is real and connected to my soul and is revelatory. I definitely do not always succeed at that, but when there's moments of that in a song or an album, that's when I feel like I‚Äôm going in the right direction.   Inspirations behind the new ‚ÄúStill Run‚Äù album?KZ: This album was about leaving relationships, whether they be romantic, work, family, etc., and the aftermath of making those decisions. It was made during a pretty transitional time for the band and is a documentation of that time.  Most meaningful song from the album?KZ: "This Woman Loves You" stands out to me because it felt like a departure stylistically. It started as a love song about a boy and then turned into being about my struggle to deal with the disappointment I was having with the country, the men I know, and myself in a very dark time for America. I was trying to write my own version of the national anthem to make sense of what was going on. JV: The songs I feel the most connection to from this album are ‚ÄúThere's a Reason‚Äù and ‚ÄúSoftens.‚Äù They're the songs I had the most involvement in writing-wise and in terms of instrumentation/production are the two where I feel I had the most artistic license in developing. ‚ÄúThere's a Reason‚Äù especially comes to mind because I'm particularly happy with the string arrangement.    What do you want your listeners to experience from your music?KZ: I hope that it can bring them some sort of peace, clarity, or joy. Whenever people say that they heard a song and it felt like they were hearing their own story, it always makes me happy to be able to give that kind of connection to someone.  How does your music influence your style and vice versa?KZ: I tend to think pretty big picture and am less detail-oriented with music, and I think you can see that in how I dress; I try to be as simple as possible with both. But sometimes it's good to incorporate one complication, like a riff or a sound that is ornate, same thing with style. It can be fun to have one elaborate thing that can be at the center of a simple outfit.  JV: I like things to feel worn and lived in, so I end up mostly buying used clothes or not really loving a piece of clothing until it's completely threadbare and worn out. In the same sense, when I am working on music, I want things to sound unique, like they have a life of their own, as opposed to the canned sounds of a sample pack or a synth preset or something. So I spend a lot of time working and reworking these sounds, layering things, sending the audio in and out of the computer and through other gear, etc., until it feels a bit more lived in.   JV: My go-to outfit at the moment is some thrifted wide-leg denim pants with a white tee tucked in, worn in brown boots, and a vintage Yankees baseball hat.  Favorite Gucci pieces from the shoot and why?KZ: I loved wearing the embellished white sneakers and the floral dress most.  JV: I loved wearing the checkered suit with the Yankees slippers. I don't feel quite myself in most high-end fashion, but it felt very natural wearing these for some reason. I also love the Flashtrek sneaker.  What‚Äôs next for Wet?KZ: We have a big tour coming up in the UK and Europe this coming November. We'll be opening for Florence And The Machine throughout the UK, and playing some headline shows as well. Our new Album ‚ÄúStill Run‚Äù is out now and we'll be releasing more music soon.

 *Books vacation aboard the Chanel liner immediately* When it comes to runway shows, Chanel knows how to pull out all the stops. So it should hardly come as a surprise that today, for its Cruise 2019 show in Paris, the fashion house brought an actual cruise ship onto its runway. The larger-than-life liner, named 'La Pausa' after Gabrielle Chanel's summer house on the French Riviera, served as the ultimate backdrop to the fashion house's nautical-inspired collection.  After models boarded the Chanel-branded ship alongside Karl Lagerfeld for the grand finale, the ship then opened up to guests, making for the ultimate photo op.    As for the collection itself, there were plenty of white and navy stripes, berets, and straw hats perfect for your next getaway on the French Riviera. There was also, of course, no shortage of Chanel's signature tweed in the form of skirt suits and dresses. Perhaps most striking, however, was the fact that nearly every look was worn with a pair of white tights‚Äîan item that's been pass√© in the fashion world for quite some time now.  Bella Hadid hit the runway in a blue two-piece set accessorized with a tweed beret and pearl belt. Stella Maxwell, Adut Akech, Gigi, and Bella Hadid were amongst some of the models who walked the show. Chanel regulars including Kristen Stewart‚Äîwho wore a black sparkling tuxedo dress‚Äî and Lily-Rose Depp were amongst those sitting in the front row.  This, of course, is hardly the first time Chanel went big with the set of its runway show. In the past, the fashion house has transformed its runway set into a space station, supermarket, airport, carousel, and more. 
 Prepare to see them all over the red carpet next year. Maria Grazia Chiuri closed Dior's Spring 2018 show today with a colorful string of sheer and sequined dresses that are screaming to be on the red carpet. The designer presented on day one of Paris Fashion Week, once again bringing her take on feminist messages and feminine silhouettes to the French house‚Äîthis time with some eye-catching hues. The presentation began with a black-and-white color scheme‚Äîin checkerboard prints, stripes and polka dots‚Äîand various denim looks, but as the show progressed, more color (and shimmer) was introduced. The final ensembles in Dior's 80-piece spring collection were a range of sequined dresses in pink, red, blue, orange and yellow-green. Each had a mosaic sequin-covered bodice (which appeared to include shorts) with a bustier top and Christian Dior logo straps‚Äîtwo design motifs Chiuri has introduced as the brand's new signatures. A midi-length sheer skirt was layered on top, held up with a thin black bow at the waist, acting like a thin curtain of dotted tulle. We wouldn't be surprised if Dior muses like Jennifer Lawrence or Emma Watson sported one of these next year, or even this season. The looks were paired with knee-high fishnet boots, thin chokers, layered necklaces, leather bracelets and sequined iterations of Dior's street style-friendly flap bags that matched with each gown. Chiuri also sent similar looks down the runway, which included less color but equal wattage with silver sequins. The set design proved a big help when it came to amplifying the shine. The crystal-like venue, constructed in the Mus√©e Rodin, required "80,000 pieces of mirror, 7.2 tons of coated concrete, 20 days of labor-intensive installation, a workforce of 80, a total surface area of 2,200 square meters," Dior revealed on Instagram. The result was simply stunning:

 The house addressed the current abortion debates with "My Body, My Choice" jackets and more.  As states like Alabama and Georgia attempt to strip women of their rights to abortion, Alessandro Michele is looking back to the feminist movement of the '70s for inspiration. Mirroring the current political climate, the designer advocated for women's reproductive rights and equality with Gucci's Cruise 2020 collection.  Staged in Rome at the Capitoline Museums, the fashion house's latest runway show was all about freedom, self-expression, and gender equality. The concept centered around a very important date in Italian history: May 22, 1978, the day that abortion became legal in the country. Michele paid homage to the historic day by embroidering the date ‚Äò22.5.78‚Äô across a mini capelet.   Moments before the #GucciCruise20 fashion show unfolding at Rome‚Äôs Capitoline Museums @museiincomuneroma, a look with ‚Äò22.5.78‚Äô refers to the date established of the Italian statute for the social protection of motherhood and the voluntary interruption of pregnancy, better known as statute 194. This jacket is created from @alessandro_michele‚Äôs continuing vision of freedom, equality and self-expression. Since founding @chimeforchange in 2013‚Äîthe global campaign that represents and advocates for gender equality‚Äî@gucci has a longstanding commitment to women and girls by funding projects around the world to support sexual and reproductive rights, maternal health, and the freedom of individual choice.

"It was a historical moment when women ‚Äî finally ‚Äî rejected all the constraints that were imposed in the previous centuries and they became free. That‚Äôs why I am paying homage to the Italian law regarding abortion, the law number 194. It‚Äôs unbelievable that around the world there are still people who believe that they can control a woman‚Äôs body, a woman‚Äôs choice. I will always stand behind the freedom of being, always."  All of the pieces coincide with Gucci's Chime for Change campaign, a non-profit organization advocating for gender equality and women's reproductive rights around the world. Since its inception in 2013, the mission has raised $15 million to support projects in 89 countries‚Äîdirectly benefitting over 570,000 girls and women globally. 
 The supermodel called the incident "revolting," and rightfully so.  Naomi Campbell revealed that she was recently turned away from a French hotel because she is black. Speaking to the publication Paris Match, the supermodel said she was invited to attend an event at a hotel in the south of France around the time of the Cannes Film Festival, but she and her friend were denied entry "because of the color of my skin."  "The guy at the entrance pretended that the place was [full]. But he let other people pass," Campbell said, per The Root. She did not specify which hotel refused to let her in.  "It‚Äôs because of revolting moments like this one that I‚Äôll continue to express myself and make myself heard," she added.  Campbell is a vocal advocate for diversity in the fashion industry and acknowledges in the interview that she's paved the way for models of color who rose to fame after her. However, she notes that the struggle for racial equality and inclusivity in fashion is by no means over. "The challenge is permanent," she said, according to The Root. The supermodel also recently told Reuters that representation in the industry has changed "in so many ways" since she first started out, but people shouldn't think of it as a passing fad. "It‚Äôs finally ... sunken in but now we hope people don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs in for a trend, like clothes are in for a season and out for a season, that‚Äôs not going to happen," she said.  Over the past few years, Campbell has teamed up with fellow game-changing models Iman and Bethann Hardison to address and fight racism in fashion. Iman told Harper's BAZAAR of the impact of their collaboration, "I think we‚Äôre seeing the change on the runways and in campaigns." 
 And one of Helmut Lang's branded cabs is giving away free designer merch. In 1998, Helmut Lang became the first fashion brand to advertise on NYC's yellow taxi signs, according to the brand. Nineteen years later, the label is paying tribute to its shared history with the city with a new capsule of merch, modeled by some of New York's very own cab drivers. The limited-edition capsule consists of a long-sleeve tee ($125) and two hoodie styles ($210 each) with minimal designs, save a logo on the chest or graphic print across the back. Though the pieces are available to shop in-store, online at helmutlang.com and at select retailers, there's also an opportunity to snag one for free. In addition to creating the collection, Helmut Lang is also advertising on 275 taxis operating in the city. Catch one for a ride, and you just might arrive at your stop with a new top. Follow @helmutlang on social media for updates on giveaways. Choosing everyday people as models is no surprise for Lang, after Shayne Oliver designed the brand's latest collection and presented it on the runway without no Insta-famous models (√† la Jenner, Hadid or Gerber) on his runway. Oliver isn't attached to this taxi collection however; it's a new installment by Lang's editor-in-residence Isabella Burley. Flip through to get a better look at the collection and learn more about the people wearing it. Tony, 67, started driving taxis in 1976. He's originally from Greece, but is currently living in Bayside, Queens. Tony is wearing the taxi long-sleeve tee.  Isaul, 57, started driving taxis in 1996. He's originally from Honduras, but is currently living in the Bronx with his wife and three kids. Isaul is wearing the copyright hoodie.  Carlos, 52, started driving taxis in 1997. He's originally from Ecuador, but is currently living in Queens with his wife and two sons. Carlos is wearing the taxis hoodie.  Tony and Isaul share a hug. Tony shows off the image printed on the back of the taxi long-sleeve tee. The original photo was taken by Iain R. Webb in 2000.  The drivers were photographed at a body shop in Long Island City, Queens. Helmut Lang taxi hoodie, $210, nordstrom.com.  SHOP Helmut Lang taxi long-sleeve tee, $125, nordstrom.com.

 The mega-influencer behind WeWoreWhat is relaunching her overalls collection and taking her swimwear collaboration into a licensing deal, all with a new e-commerce site to match. Danielle Bernstein is what is known in the modern world as a mega-influencer. With 2.1 million Instagram followers globally hanging on her every move, the word influence can sound like an understatement. But it didn't happen overnight. Nearly a decade ago, Bernstein was using her time as a student at FIT to launch her blogging career. What began as a street style blog and then a personal style diary, morphed into the huge moneymaking endeavor you scroll through today.  Famously candid, she's revealed how much she and Insta-stars in her social media stratosphere get paid. Though some were taken aback by the number ($8,000 to $20,000 per post, according to a 2017 Forbes interview), underestimating the worth of a young woman in business sounds more like business as usual than anything particularly having to do with influencers.  If Bernstein has encountered haters in the past, they haven't affected her bottom line. The New Yorker is upping the ante with the launch of an e-commerce site that will house the relaunch of her overalls collection and, come November, the swimwear from a licensing deal with Onia that began as a collaboration earlier this year. Below, see her new WeWoreWhat overalls and hear more from Bernstein on her business (as not so usual).  What‚Äôs the difference between collaborating with Onia and doing a licensing deal? From the backend: nothing. They will still remain my production partner, design partner, and logistics, but WeWoreWhat will be its own brand now with its own website.   What does this jump mean for you personally and professionally? I've proven that I can design and sell product now, so the timing feels right with launching my own e-comm site and wholesale business.  You‚Äôve done a lot of collaborations, like a very successful one with Joe‚Äôs Jeans earlier this year. Why is it important to you also to have collections under your brand name directly? Collaborations have been really good to me, but it's time that I bring everything under my own brand and start growing WeWoreWhat's awareness as a label.  WeWoreWhat overalls were doing well. What made you take a step back and reassess to relaunch? I've been running it on my own as a direct-to-consumer business for three years, and I'm ready to produce higher quantities with better qualities and have a team behind me helping things run smoothly.  What is different about them now? They are the styles our customers know and love, with the fit and fabric perfected.  How is having such direct contact with your customers helpful? What kind of feedback have you gotten from them? The feedback from our customers has helped us to perfect the fit and focus on the styles that people want. We've been able to reproduce the styles that our customers love and reintroduce ones that they've asked for.  What‚Äôs the biggest lesson you‚Äôve learned in working with other brands in heading up your own brands? How to reach the consumer in the most effective way and show them product in a way that will result in them purchasing it.  What do you say to people who underestimate the clout of influencers like you in creating their own brands? The proof is in the pudding, or in this case: my sales on day one.  Shop the entire collection, ranging from $185 to $250, at weworewhat.com.

 The One Where We All Max Out Our Credit Cards.  As every Friends fan knows, one of the best parts of the '90s sitcom was Rachel Green's wardrobe. From her wedding dress introduction in the pilot episode to her streamlined, high-fashion wardrobe in the final seasons, the Central Perk waitress-turned-Ralph Lauren employee helped define some of the decade's top trends (and hairstyles). And now, 25 years after the show's debut, Ralph Lauren is releasing a collection inspired by her iconic style. For a span of several seasons, Jennifer Aniston's character famously worked as a publicist at Ralph Lauren. The American designer even made a cameo in Season 6, appearing in a scene while riding next to Rachel [Aniston] on an elevator. To pay homage to the brand's role in the series, Ralph Lauren partnered with Warner Bros. Consumer Products on a "wear-to-work collection" inspired by Rachel's character.   Perfectly embodying the style of Rachel Green, the collection includes a range of ribbed turtlenecks, a plaid miniskirt, leather separates, classic white shirting, and leather knee-high boots. There are also pops of leopard and purple shearling, paying tribute to some of the character's more playful fashion moments along the years.  The collection, which ranges from $69 to $2,998, includes pieces from both the Polo and Lauren Ralph Lauren brands. It's available to shop now online at ralphlauren.com, but will also fittingly be sold at Bloomingdale's (another company Rachel Green worked for on Friends). On September 21 and 22, Bloomingdale's 59th Street flagship store will have a replica of the show's Central Perk coffee shop on-site, where customers can shop the collection and sip a cup of complimentary coffee.

 Meet "Living Coral," a color that symbolizes our need for optimism. We can all probably agree that 2018 hasn't been the best of years, for reasons I likely don't have to list out here. But with just a few weeks left until 2019, Pantone is hoping to usher some positivity into all of our lives in the New Year. To do so, the color company has declared "Living Coral," as its 2019 Color of the Year.  "Symbolizing our innate need for optimism and joyful pursuits, Living Coral embodies our desire for playful expression," the company explained of its color choice.  Living Coral, which Pantone describes as "an animating and life-affirming shade of orange with a golden undertone," is meant to provide us with "comfort and buoyancy in our continually shifting environment"‚Äîsimilar to how coral reefs provide shelter and protection to their ocean habitats. In other words, if you're stressing out over the news and toxicity of social media (ahem, pretty much all of us), Pantone hopes this pretty hue will make you feel a little more optimistic. Ideal for spring fashion along with beauty, home decor, and even the latest iPhone, Living Coral will likely take over as a color trend in more than one sector for 2019. It's also worth noting that the shade isn't too far off from millennial pink, the color that's dominated all arenas over the last few years, despite Pantone's other forecasting predictions. Living Coral follows Ultra-Violet, which was Pantone's Color of the Year in 2018 and Greenery, which was the Color of the Year for 2017. 
 The 15-year-old makes her modeling debut.  The Stranger Things kids are no strangers when it comes to the fashion world (sorry it's Friday afternoon, let me have this bad pun moment).  Fourteen-year-old Millie Bobby Brown already has a Calvin Klein campaign under her belt, 16-year-old Caleb McLaughlin sat front row at New York Fashion Week, and every single one of the teens has consistently slayed on the red carpet. But now, Season 2 newbie Sadie Sink is getting in on the fashion action too.  The 15-year-old made her runway debut today walking Undercover's Fall 2018 show at Paris Fashion Week. Wearing a monochromatic red look, Sink opened the show in a hoodie, jogging pants, sneakers, and a matching crystal-embellished beanie. The appearance marked her first gig as a runway model. Though Undercover's designer, Jun Takahashi, was inspired by "eternal youth" for his Fall 2018 collection, it should be noted that the fashion industry has a general rule not to cast models under the age of 16 on the runway‚Äîmaking 15-year-old Sink's catwalk debut a controversial casting choice. The CFDA, LVMH, and Kering have all pledged not to work with any runway models under 16 years of age in order to protect young models from unsafe working conditions. While Sink may already be an established actress, her casting in the show is still slightly problematic.  Of course, this is likely just the beginning of the young actress's foray in the fashion world. The teenager has already starred in several editorials and landed a spot in a Miu Miu campaign.   So honored to be in the #MiuMiuWhispers campaign. A post shared by  Sadie Sink (@sadiesink_) on Dec 16, 2017 at 1:30pm PST Expect to see more of Sadie Sink‚Äîbut let's save the runway appearances until after her 16th birthday, shall we?

 Several male models have claimed they were sexually exploited by the photographers. A new expose by The New York Times, released Saturday, recounts the testimonies of 28 former and current models who claim they were sexually exploited by fashion photographers Mario Testino and Bruce Weber. The allegations span from the 1990s to the present day, and allege that both photographers used their standing in the fashion world to sexually manipulate, molest, abuse, and coerce the male models they worked with. Of the 15 male models who have accused Weber, one in particular, Robyn Sinclair, told The New York Times, "I remember him putting his fingers in my mouth, and him grabbing my privates. We never had sex or anything, but a lot of things happened. A lot of touching. A lot of molestation." And of the shocking allegations against Weber, the publication wrote that "The men recalled, with remarkable consistency, private sessions with Mr. Weber in which he asked them to undress and led them through breathing and 'energy' exercises. Models were asked to breathe and to touch both themselves and Mr. Weber, moving their hands wherever they felt their 'energy.' Often, Mr. Weber guided their hands with his own." "I remember him putting his fingers in my mouth, and him grabbing my privates," a male model said of Bruce Weber. "He was a sexual predator," another model said of Mario Testino. https://t.co/eJRtNOfbVn According to The New York Times, 13 men who have worked with Testino have said that "he subjected them to sexual advances that in some cases included groping and masturbation." A former Gucci model called Jason Fedele alleges, "If you wanted to work with Mario, you needed to do a nude shoot at the Chateau Marmont. All the agents knew that this was the thing to excel or advance your career." Weber responded to the allegations in a statement released by his lawyer, and said, "I'm completely shocked and saddened by the outrageous claims being made against me, which I absolutely deny." Testino's lawyer also responded, claiming that the models The New York Times had spoken to "cannot be considered reliable sources." In December 2017, a male model brought a law suit against Weber claiming sexual harassment. Weber denied all of the allegations brought against him in the complaint.

 Your "Wild Thoughts" may have just been realized. After the multi-million dollar success of her Fenty beauty collection, it's apt that Rihanna would consider expanding her brand into other entrepreneurial routes. In an unforeseen yet fitting retail move, Rihanna is reportedly stepping into the lingerie business to launch her own line of intimates, according to WWD. The full details of RiRi's rumored underwear label are still undisclosed, but TechStyle Fashion Group (formerly JustFab)‚Äîthe parent company behind Kate Hudson's activewear collection, Fabletics, and other subscription shopping sites like ShoeDazzle and JustFab‚Äîhas reportedly struck a deal with Rihanna for an exclusive collection of undergarments. Reps for Rihanna and TechStyle have yet to comment on the claim, but some sources told WWD that TechStyle has been working to bring the project to fruition for more than a year, and design samples have already been produced. Likely citing the unequivocal and rapid successes of Rihanna's Fenty Beauty line and Fenty x Puma collaboration, WWD reports that a RiRi-labeled lingerie line may be a strategic effort for TechStyle to gain revenue by rounding out its product offerings and show growth ahead of going public and filing for IPO.  Lloyd Greif, president and chief executive officer of Los Angeles investment bank Greif & Co, told WWD that "the Rihanna brand play would be to convince the market that the company [TechStyle] has strong growth ahead because IPOs are all about growth ahead.‚Äù Rihanna has already shown us how quickly her brand can make money without sacrificing diversity. Her inclusive Fenty Beauty makeup line just launched in September, but it's already on track to outsell Kylie Jenner's buzzworthy Kylie Cosmetics brand, which is two year old.  While we're still waiting on any official confirmation regarding the specifics of the collection or the anticipated launch date, it's looking like your future favorite bra could be a BadGal RiRi original.
 Liberation was in the air when Tony Mazzola took the helm of Bazaar in 1972. His two-decade reign would see thebirth of feminism, the rise of celebrity culture, and the return of American glamour. By the time Anthony T. Mazzola was named editor in chief of Harper‚Äôs Bazaar in 1972, the magazine was already wrestling with a major sociological shift. ‚ÄúLiberation‚Äù was the catchword to describe the impact of feminism, but the conversations that surrounded the issues of marriage, careers, and motherhood were changing in ways that the magazine had only just begun to address. With the war in Vietnam and the country heading for an economic recession, there was a strong sense of the present in fashion. In November 1973, at the beginning of Mazzola‚Äôs second year at Bazaar, upstart American designers duked it out with French heavyweights at the Battle of Versailles, a charity fashion show held to raise money for the palace‚Äôs restoration. And women like Lauren Hutton and Ali MacGraw were defining a new wave of free-spirited, effortless American style.  As an editor, the New Jersey‚Äìborn Mazzola was a polymath, with well-cultivated tastes in art and photography. He‚Äôd worked as a commercial artist while attending night school at Cooper Union in Manhattan. After being drafted into the Army, he served in military intelligence throughout World War II while stationed in New Guinea and the Philippines, earning a Bronze Star. He later returned to New York, and in 1948, at the age of 25, was hired to be the art director at Hearst‚Äôs Town & Country by the magazine‚Äôs editor, Henry Sell, who had edited Bazaar in the 1920s.  Mazzola became the editor of Town & Country in 1965 and, over the next several years, funneled his curiosities into the magazine. Town & Country became a lively paean to old money, high society, Hollywood, haute fashion, lavish living, and modern art, and it teemed with stellar photography, publishing the work of Richard Avedon, Jerry Schatzberg, and Mazzola‚Äôs friend Slim Aarons, among others.  In 1971, a long advertising decline, coupled with a slide in circulation, prompted Hearst executives to hire Women‚Äôs Wear Daily executive James Brady to serve as both the editorial director and publisher of Bazaar. A brusque former marine from Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, Brady‚Äîwho was brought in over longtime editor Nancy White‚Äîmade his presence felt swiftly and decisively as he set to work transforming the magazine into a fashionable news monthly. His remake was sweeping in scope, aimed at infusing Bazaar with hard-hitting journalism and immediacy. Issues were built around themes like ‚ÄúPolitics ‚Äô72‚Äù and ‚ÄúGossip vs. Privacy.‚Äù Stories featuring Washington and the media were intermingled with dispatches from the cultural chattering class. Brady did away with what he referred to in his 1974 book, Superchic, as ‚Äúpious little essays on elegance, saccharine poetry, and fiction that had earlier been rejected at other, higher-paying outlets.‚Äù He also banished fashion models in favor of ‚Äúreal‚Äù people and personalities, whom the magazine photo-graphed in more ‚Äúrelatable‚Äù situations (for instance, chasing a cab down the street). Under Brady, Bazaar also delved into the one subject its founding publisher, Fletcher Harper, had considered verboten: politics. Bazaar coaxed playwright Tennessee Williams to pen an article about the nature of dissent in a country fractured by the Vietnam War; profiled Gloria Steinem just before the launch of her feminist magazine, Ms.; and published a controversial photograph of actress Faye Dunaway in bed with her unshaven armpit exposed. Despite all this, Brady‚Äôs reimagining of Bazaar didn‚Äôt connect with readers or advertisers. The arrangement with White didn‚Äôt last long either. Though she‚Äôd remained cordial through the transition, she resigned three months later. Soon Brady was gone too, and the experiment ended after 14 months.  As for Mazzola, his eclectic tastes would prove useful at Bazaar. He liked to describe it as ‚Äúthe fashion magazine with a little salt and pepper added,‚Äù and under his watch, its appetites were omnivorous: Pieces on artists and other influential figures ran alongside stories on celebrities and careers. Nevertheless, his version of Bazaar represented a clean break from Brady‚Äôs; it was engineered to be popular, and for Mazzola that meant putting the focus back on fashion.  One of Mazzola‚Äôs first hires was Carrie Donovan.With her oversize black glasses and pearls, Donovan was a fashion editor in the Diana Vreeland mold; in fact, before joining Bazaar she had been' Vreeland‚Äôs top deputy at Vogue. But while Donovan had an undeniable flair for the fantastical, she had a populist touch too, and brought an accessibility and ease to Bazaar‚Äôs fashion pages. Even if their lives appeared fabulous, the women in the magazine lived in their clothes, and looks from the runways were translated in wearable ways. As the country slouched into an economic slump and affordability was a factor, Bazaar devoted features to seasonless fashion and ‚ÄúClothes You Can Bank On‚Äù to provide good value. Mazzola also introduced age as a franchise; issues with cover lines like ‚ÄúOver-40 & Fabulous‚Äù became a well-received staple.  Visually, Mazzola brought more traditional fashion photography back to the magazine. Pictures by Bill King and Rico Puhlmann brimmed with warmth and energy, as models smiled, jumped, ran, and skipped on sandy beaches. Images of society people and up-and-coming jet-setters were presented with polish but also an unstudied intimacy, and high glamour was rendered with sophistication. Perhaps the biggest star of the early Mazzola years was the Japanese American photographer Hiro, whose pioneering use of color and often arresting juxtapositions were both wildly inventive and brazenly suggestive.  The Studio 54 era ushered in a more cosmopolitan view of fashion and, with it, Halston. His chic, minimalist clothes were worn by Liza Minnelli, Bianca Jagger, and Elizabeth Taylor, and his friendship with Minnelli, a defining one for the period, held special significance for Bazaar. Kay Thompson, a singer and author (and Minnelli‚Äôs godmother) who played a character inspired by Vreeland in the film Funny Face, was cajoled by Bazaar fashion editor D.D. Ryan into writing the Eloise books, rumored to be based on Liza. It was Thompson who‚Äôd introduced Minnelli to Halston, and he soon became Minnelli‚Äôs confidant and personal-style adviser. The notion of living well in the mid-1970s had a lot to do with physical and emotional fitness. Bazaar‚Äôs paragon of beauty at the time was Cheryl Tiegs, whose golden California glow and athletic outdoorsiness made her the perfect avatar for health and wellness. But the glitz of the disco era would prove a harbinger of things to come. By the end of the decade, glamour was back, as was the economy, and as the ‚Äô80s beckoned, celebrity, wealth, and careerism began to play a central role in fashion. In the Reagan years, the notion of simply wanting more wouldn‚Äôt be enough. Success‚Äîand fashion‚Äîwould be determined by having it all. This article originally appeared in the August 2017 issue of Harper's Bazaar.

 Lola Rykiel, Sonia Rykiel's granddaughter, taps into her fashion DNA for a fun new athleisure line. Athleisure brands tend to follow the same formula‚Äîminimal, with some cutouts on leggings, something cropped, a lot of black. Lola Rykiel is shaking up the status quo with a bold new athleisure collection, called Pompom, inspired by her famed designer grandmother, the late Sonia Rykiel, and her past as a ballerina under the instruction of the inimitable Martha Graham. "The collection incorporates the velours that my grandmother loved as well as stretch Lycra materials and playful detailing," Rykiel explains, referring in part to a basketball jersey complete with mermaid-esque paillettes.   The collection, which hits retail in November, also includes biker shorts, bold pops of pink, and pieces that would look just as at home out for a chic dinner as post-barre class. Hear more from Rykiel about her new venture and see the full lookbook, shot on location of Sonia Rykiel's apartment in Paris, below.  Lola Rykiel: I started when I was a little girl in Paris. One of Sonia's younger sisters, my Aunt Janine, had a ballet school called Stanlowa. It still exists now. It is a real  institution in Paris! I started when I was 3 or 4, like most little French girls. I continued until I was 10 and then switched to different styles‚Äîmodern jazz, contemporary, et cetera, tap dance. I did a long break and took it more seriously after I was 17 and enrolled in the Martha Graham School in NYC a few years later.  I feel like now working out is more and more part of everyday life, not only for ex-dancers like me but as well for a lot of women. I saw it when I was living in NYC obviously, where everyone goes to yoga, Pilates, cycling, running before or after work, but now that I am back in France, I noticed how much more French women are working out and are being much less timid about it.  I felt a bit frustrated with what was available. I wish it was a bit more fun, glamorous, but still comfy and good to move in. I don't want to be ashamed if I bumped into someone I know after a workout, because I just don't have a cute outfit. Pompon means "tassels" in French, but with an American twist. My grandmother used to put pompons everywhere‚Äîon the shoes, the sweaters, her drawings, packed the presents she will give us for birthdays. I loved the way she pronounced it too. It is synonymous of childhood for me and very nostalgic.  Then growing up in Paris, I was fascinated by American high school culture that I saw in movies like Grease.  I wanted to be a cheerleader with a uniform and have some  pompoms too! But in France, there is no such thing‚Äîsame for lockers at school or diners with milkshakes and waitress with Rollerblades.  I always loved watching the dance outfits, the total pale pink look of the little ballerina at the dance school with her little bun and the modern dancers during rehearsals wearing tights, a leotard, and a huge conformable trousers rolled up to the knees, or a large sweaters to keep warm.  I love the in-between-look moment, not the actual outfit that the performer will wear for the show. I was as well inspired as well by the velours of my childhood, the one that my grandmother did so well and that so many women around me and in the world loved. My mother, aunts, cousins used to wear velours at home. It was a way of being chic and relaxed. Well, in so many different ways. I like the idea of being sophisticated and accessible‚Äîshe was one of the first to do pr√™t-√†-porter. I like the idea of not taking yourself too seriously. It is only clothes at the end of the day, not open-heart surgery‚Äîand what I love is the idea of clothes serving us rather than us fitting into clothes.

 The influencer talks self-love, body confidence, and summer styling tips.  Katie Sturino, founder of the body-positive fashion blog The 12ish Style, has teamed up with popular styling service Stitch Fix to create a 21-piece collection of the must-have pieces for your summer wardrobe. Sturino, known for her colorful and whimsical style, is targeting the everyday woman who wants to add some more fun elements to her closet. "I find that fast fashion is much safer than high fashion. So I wanted to bring a little bit more of that high fashion feel to a lower price point, without making it garbage," she says.    The Megababe founder regularly champions size inclusivity, which is why it's no surprise that a large size range is a key component of her capsule collection. Available in sizes 0‚Äì24 and XS‚Äì3X, the Katie Sturino x Stitch Fix collaboration is also affordably priced ($54 - $98), making it accessible for all kinds of budgets. Although she's previously collaborated with Eloquii and Veronica Beard, Sturino recalls being "blown away" by Stitch Fix's operation. "They had a person on their fit team who was doing things with plus-size fits that I have never seen before‚Äîreally showing factories how a woman's body moves, and just very different than anything I had seen," she explains.  When asked who she would love to see dressed in the capsule collection, Sturino gets excited at the thought of her muse, Italian fashion editor Giovanna Battaglia, potentially wearing something she created. "Also, I would love to dress Aidy Bryant because I know I've experienced first-hand the struggles she's had when finding cool clothes. I feel like she would really like the line," says Sturino. Coinciding with the collection's debut, Sturino sat down with BAZAAR.com to discuss self-love, body confidence, and her favorite summer styling tips.  Harper's BAZAAR: You're all about female empowerment and self-love. Tell us about your journey to self-acceptance as a woman who isn't a sample size. Katie Sturino: I started out confident, and over time and life experience, this is pretty raw, but you get a little beaten down, and life takes you down. It's up to you to say, "Hold on a second, let me figure out exactly who the hell I am and stand up and be that person." Because if you put yourself in the dryer cycle of life, you can just get thrown around and lost. It's up to you to do the work. It's up to you to do what makes you happy, what doesn't make you happy, and sometimes those choices are really hard. And they require change‚Äîa new relationship, moving cities, moving jobs‚Äìbut the reward beyond that is so big. That's the thing where a lot of women get lost. They feel like happiness comes from an external place‚Äîit's when they're gonna meet a partner, when they're gonna have a baby‚Äînone of that makes you happy.  HB: What suggestions do you have for women who struggle to feel confident in their clothing daily? KS: Self-confidence comes from accepting yourself. I think it's all about turning the lens inward. Wear what makes you happy. Don't wear what makes you feel safe; don't wear what makes you feel "flattered." Flattering, I hate that word. If style and clothes stress you out, then that's where something like a personal stylist or Stitch Fix can help you find your style, so you're comfortable. HB: Why you don't like the word flattering? KS: I don't like the word flattering. I've heard it so many times ("It wasn't very flattering on you"). You hear that a lot, and it's annoying because you're standing there and you love it. And what is flattering, anyway? Flattering, I think, means small, thin. I understand that it is pretty much what people have to cling to and to understand if something looks good or not, but as we go forward, I would like to find other ways we can talk about what we're wearing. HB: On your blog and Instagram, you created the series #supersizethelook. What inspired you to start this movement? KS: It's something I did because I wanted to show women that they could pull off "thin woman stuff."  Because people are like, "I love Kylie Jenner, but I could never wear that." So I'm just trying to show by example, and eliminate the "I could never wear that" vibe. HB: Along with size inclusivity, how would you like to see the fashion industry innovate and better champion diversity?  KS: I think we're in a moment of tokenism right now, to an extent. Which is better than where we were, [but] it's not as great as where we're going. I'd like to see people who are selected to represent different brands because of something‚Äìbecause of what they stand for, their relationship with a brand, or that they embody the spirit of the brand. I want to see more of that and less of the "We need to cast an Asian girl." Then in turn, as we evolve these campaigns and the messaging, people need to be less call-out culture as we move forward. I want it to be less angry every time there is an attempt at diversity. HB: Now that it's officially summer, what are some of your fashion staples this season? KS: Birkenstocks and caftans, which is why we made three of them. I will be wearing a lot of headbands this summer because you can wear your hair back, but it‚Äôs like you have something. I typically like light jewelry in the summer. I just get really hot. HB: You've designed collections, inspired women with your blog, and founded your wellness line Megababe. What do you hope to check off your bucket list next? KS: I think there's something in fitness. I think it's coming for me. I think the Stitch Fix collection is major because we're doing four of them, so we get to dip into all of our dreams and fantasies for clothes we can't find. And again, maybe making more staple clothes and less trend-driven clothes. I'm hoping these are pieces people will keep in their closets.  Check out the full collection below. 

 You can easily copy this outfit with pieces from your closet.   This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. Summer temperatures can be brutal. You sweat the moment you step out of the house, and sometimes, it's simply too hot to wear pants. Sure, maxi and sundresses were made for situations like the latter, but Emily Ratajkowski has an easy DIY alternative you can whip right out of your closet. All you need is an oversize button-down and a belt. The 28-year-old model was spotted in New York City yesterday wearing a white button-down cinched with a chain belt by Black & Brown at the waist. She rolled up the sleeves to her elbows and kept a few buttons undone to reveal a variety of layered gold necklaces dangling at her chest. To complete her chic spin on the Risky Business look, Ratajkowski sported white sneakers, cat-eye sunglasses, Jennifer Fisher hoop earrings, and a snakeskin shoulder bag.    The simple ensemble is reminiscent of  a look Carrie Bradshaw donned in Sex and the City, featuring one of Mr. Big's shirts and a Herm√®s belt. It's equal parts effortless, resourceful, and chic. We wonder if EmRata stole her shirt from hubby Sebastian Bear-McClard's closet.    This oft-requested outfit really distills Carrie down to her purest form - improbable chic. It certainly is her most resourceful outfit of the series. The use of Mr. Big‚Äôs crisp white button-down (no doubt Brioni) and his Herm√®s belt to highlight her waist is pure genius. Perpetually on-trend, Carrie‚Äôs knack for deconstructing and elevating basics anticipates the design ethos of the Vetements collective, further reinforced by the excessive sleeve and belt length. Only Carrie could turn this sartorial tragedy (a ruined Richard Tyler bias-cut dress) into an opportunity to let the Upper East Side know she‚Äôs got great legs. We‚Äôre also here for the slutty Annie Hall vibes that this outfit gives us. But BEWARE FOLLOWERS, this is a look not to be tried at home üö´(S3/EP18) #CarrieBradshaw #Vetements #Hermes #AnnieHallMoment A post shared by  Every Outfit on Sex & the City (@everyoutfitonsatc) on Dec 4, 2016 at 11:46am PST  The key here is grabbing a top that's just big enough to reach your thighs, so you don't end up flashing anyone. (Bradshaw's DIY minidress was just high enough, but the back side of her shirt dipped lower for extra coverage.) If all else fails, you could always slip a handy pair of biker shorts underneath‚ÄîRatajkowski is a big fan of the trend. Earlier this month, the model and Inamorata designer was seen wearing the figure-hugging, cropped bottoms with a white bra, blazer, and heels.  Want more style inspiration from EmRata's seasonal wardrobe? Think summer whites. Whether or not she's rocking a crisp oxford shirt, the model has opted for neutral tones for some of her most impressive looks, from a fringy, boho Jacquemus number to one of her own collaborations with Nasty Gal. 
 Go inside the NYC mainstay‚Äôs luxe new digs. Kirna Zab√™te has been a long-time NYC retail mainstay‚Äîholding court in SoHo for 18 years. Now the Beth Buccini-founded boutique is getting new digs in Palm Beach, Florida at The Royal Poinciana Plaza, its fourth location. The preppy locale will serve as the newest backdrop for Kirna Zab√™te‚Äôs bold ready to wear and accessories from designers both big and small. The Steven Gambrel of SR Gambrel designed space has its own personality, but maintains KZ design hallmarks like black and white flooring, pink accents, a red cash wrap and sprawling chandeliers. Go inside the new space and get the low down on how Kirna Zab√™te goes to Florida from Buccini. Why Palm Beach for Kirna Zab√™te's newest store opening? It has always been my philosophy to open stores in places where I have a good understanding of the clientele and where the community is underserved. I have been fortunate to get to know the area over the years because both my parents and in-laws have homes there, where I have spent many holidays and vacations, soaking up the Florida sunshine. I can't wait do the same this winter while serving the Palm Beach residents with a shopping destination that is happy and fun.  Inspiration behind the store's design? The boutique is the third Kirna Zab√™te location designed by interior decorator Steven Gambrel of SR Gambrel. While each Kirna Zab√™te location has its own personality, Steven and I embraced the opportunity to create a unique experience in Palm Beach, keeping certain Kirna Zab√™te signature design elements in tact‚Äîincluding black and white flooring, pink accents throughout, beautiful arches, a lollipop red cash wrap and our classic 6 feet wide chandeliers‚Äîwith the addition of custom De Gournay wallpaper in the shoe salon, specifically for Palm Beach.   Double tap if you are hiding inside until spring. üì∑ by @danliphotography #KZLoves @borgodenor @houseoflafayette @poolsidebags A post shared by  Kirna Zab√™te (@kirnazabete) on Jan 14, 2018 at 9:40am PST What is the quintessential Palm Beach style? Words that come to mind when I think of Palm Beach style include vibrant, colorful, jet-set, luxury and fun.  How does the Palm Beach edit differ from your NYC location? The buy across all stores is primarily the same, however, being that Palm Beach is a beach locale vs. a city locale, we tend to sprinkle in a bit more pieces with a jet-set and evening wear vibe to cater to the clients who have the warmer climate year round.

 It‚Äôs one of the season‚Äôs biggest trends, and you CAN wear them anytime.  Even the most dedicated fashion fiend needs the occasional reassurance that the trend she fell in love with on the runways is going to be the look du jour once it finally arrives in stores. In a digital world with so many voices, trusted fashion resources‚Äîlike Macy's The Edit‚Äîare more important now than ever.  This season, a trend to note is florals. Whether they're big and bold or discreet and subtle, bouquet-inspired prints are a look to try. Here, see how three of BAZAAR's favorite women interpret them.  Check out these trends and more at Macy‚Äôs The Edit!
 Here's your first look. We already have a first look at Victoria's Secret and Balmain's highly anticipated collaboration. Both brands (and creative director Olivier Rousteing) took to Instagram this morning to share a video teasing their upcoming range. The clip hints that the collection will feature black fabrics, metallic adornments, jeweled accents and rocker studs‚Äîand that's just the beginning. "My BalmainArMy becomes THE ANGELSARMY," Rousteing proudly wrote on Instagram. Take a look below: It was reported yesterday that the French brand will be designing custom looks for this year's VS fashion show in Shanghai, and a retail range will also be available to shop shortly after the presentation airs. The Victoria's Secret Fashion Show airs on November 28 on CBS. VS x Balmain launches in store and online on November 29.  
 
 Meet Clair, the Rebag system that's streamlining the bag resale market. A couple of years ago, it made global news that buying an Herm√®s Birkin bag offered a better return on investment than going all in on the stock market. The e-commerce site Rebag has built a business on the viability of the luxury resale bag market, from Birkins and beyond, and now it‚Äôs taking things a step further with a new platform called Clair by Rebag. Not unlike assigning a Kelly Blue Book value to an automobile, Clair (i.e., the Comprehensive Luxury Appraisal Index for Resale), which lives on the Rebag site, assigns a special code and market price for most high-end handbag models across a list of more than 50 brands and 10,000 styles, in real time. A user accounts for brand, condition, size, and color on either the Rebag site or app, and gets a valuation, from which they can decide whether to buy, sell, or hold. Like any market you want to invest in, any brand of bag is subject to fluctuations, so Clair is regularly updated to look for changes in the market, including the sudden popularity or overexposure of certain styles. In other words, are you up for buying into some Fendi or Prada bag futures? ‚ÄúWith more and more consumers contemplating the resale value of their luxury purchases, we‚Äôve created a taxonomy that provides a more transparent way for consumers to shop more wisely,‚Äù says Charles Gorra, founder and CEO of Rebag. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve spent years gathering data and analyzing the luxury handbag market.‚Äù Herm√®s, of course, comes out on top in terms of being a good investment, with Birkin and Kelly styles taking top spots‚Äîmeaning when you leave the Herm√®s store, bag in hand, you are quite likely to make more or equal to what you paid for the bag, should you choose to resell it. Goyard and Chanel are next up in terms of being good investments, with Gucci, Saint Laurent, and Louis Vuitton trailing slightly. Currently, Bottega Veneta has only about a 30 percent return on investment, meaning if you purchase a $2,000 bag now, it may be worth only about $600 if you attempt to resell immediately. With the increasing popularity of Bottega though, who knows where it will land on Clair‚Äôs scale in the next year or two. The better question is, do you make purchases based on love or money? In a perfect world, you get a little bit of both. And now there's a way to measure that.

 The news comes after a growing list of fashion designers have pledged to stop using real animal fur.  While Versace, Gucci, Michael Kors and a growing list of luxury brands have recently vowed to stop using real fur, San Francisco just became the first major U.S. city to officially ban sales on all fur products.   Last night, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors ruled they would ban selling new fur products within the city. The ban, which goes into effect on January 1, 2019, doesn't apply to secondhand items, sheepskin or lambskin. Furriers and all retailers selling real fur products will have until 2020 to sell their current fur inventories.  "The sale of fur products in San Francisco is inconsistent with the City's ethos of treating all living beings, humans and animals alike, with kindness," supervisor Katy Tang, who pushed for the legislation, said in a statement. "There‚Äôs no humane way to raise an animal to peel its skin off."  Although the recent anti-fur movement has been a major win for animal rights activists, critics worry this move will hurt San Francisco's economy. According to The Hollywood Reporter, San Francisco's Chamber of Commerce estimates that fur sales account for at least $40 million of the city's sales per year.  Along with the economical argument, the Fur Information Council of America raised concerns about faux fur's effect on the environment. In a statement, the council revealed San Francisco's ban of animal fur would cause an increase of petroleum-based faux  fur, which would ‚Äúdirectly contradict the many positive environmental moves the SF city council has taken regarding plastics and Styrofoam.‚Äù  ‚ÄúFur? I am out of that. I don‚Äôt want to kill animals to make fashion.‚Äù - @Donatella_Versace  Versace is proud to take this ethical step into the future and hopes it will inspire innovation and raise awareness. Versace will phase out all fur products from the 2019 collections onward. A post shared by  Versace (@versace) on Mar 16, 2018 at 8:51am PDT The fashion industry has also been a strong force in the recent expansion of the anti-fur movement. More and more luxury brands are halting the use of real fur and instead opting for faux fur alternatives. Versace, Tom Ford, Michael Kors, Gucci, Furla and more have recently announced a ban on all fur products. However, brands like Karl Lagerfeld, Saint Laurent, Fendi and Dior are still using real fur in collections.  Below, see an updated guide as to which high fashion brands are no longer using real fur.  HIGH FASHION BRANDS THAT ARE NOW FUR-FREE
 Those runway videos on Instagram have finally paid off.  Great news for fans of Britney Spears' epic runway modeling videos (so basically, great news for all of us): the Princess of Pop just landed her first major fashion campaign for Kenzo.  The singer took to Instagram to reveal her new campaign for the brand's La Collection Memento N¬∞2, photographed by Peter Lindbergh. In the first image shared, Britney gives us some early 2000s vibes in a denim trucker hat and cropped green sweatshirt that shows off her lower back tattoo. Yesterday, the brand teased their A-list casting on Instagram with a quick video showcasing the "mystery" star (but really, who couldn't recognize Britney's runway walk and blonde waves from a mile away?).  Perhaps the greatest part of the campaign, however, is the recreating of her famous all-denim red carpet look from the 2001 American Music Awards. The singer poses in a denim hat, denim jacket, denim over-the-knee boots and even denim underwear in another image from the series of photos.  The campaign marks Britney's first fashion ad since her Candie's campaigns in the early-mid 2000s. Though in the past she's fronted many ads for her Candie's x Kohl's collection and vast lineup of fragrances, this marks the singer's first campaign for a major fashion brand.  It looks like all those modeling videos on Instagram have finally paid off. Now someone please take note and cast Britney in her big Fashion Week debut. She's ready.

 From Alessandra and Elsa to Natasha and Karolina.  While Kaia Gerber may be the breakout model of Fashion Month, don't count the OG supermodels out anytime soon. After an epic reunion of '90s supers at the Versace show last week, there was another moment of model nostalgia at Balmain's Spring 2018 show.  Tapping some of the top supermodels of the 2000s along with a few select Victoria's Secret Angels, Olivier Rousteing assembled a new Balmain army on the runway today in Paris. After Natalia Vodianova opened the show, Natasha Poly, Karolina Kurkova, and Kasia Struss followed suit down the catwalk‚Äîmaking for the ultimate early '00s throwback.  Along with the supermodels strutting the runway, Balmain also tapped Victoria's Secret Angels Alessandra Ambrosio, Elsa Hosk, and Josephine Skriver to walk. Consider it your more-clothed preview of this year's VS Fashion Show.  And of course, when you add early 2000s supermodels with Victoria's Secret Angels, what do you get? The ultimate runway finale brigade.  See more model moments from the Spring 2018 runways:
 In the 1920s, Bauhaus changed the modern art landscape. Then it changed fashion.   Even if you don‚Äôt immediately recognize the name Bauhaus‚Äîthe German art school known for its use of geometric shapes and graphic, clean lines‚Äîyou‚Äôve definitely seen its hallmarks.  Marcel Breuer‚Äôs famous Wassily Chair, first designed in 1925 and copied ever since, is still available for purchase. Piet Mondrian's paintings hang in modern art museums around the world, including both The Met and MoMA.  Throughout the ‚Äò60s until this very day, designers on runways from New York to Milan continuously return to the stark, striking, technicolor prints and geometric shapes that have been a Bauhaus trademark since the movement began 100 years ago. This is especially true of Prada. The Italian fashion house's new Ouverture bag styles embody the Bauhaus spirit. Each is defined by contrasts through three covetable colorways: all-black with a shock of white trim or black and tan are the options for leather; and a tan and deep brown style is what‚Äôs available in suede.  They are structured and sleek, comfortable and capacious, and 100% made in Italy. And like many of Bauhaus' inspired objects, both architectural and functional. Available in different sizes ("maxi", "midi", and "mignon"), they feature shoulder straps, double handles, tapes, and hyper-thin straps that can be worn as a hand, arm, shoulder, or cross-body bag. They work for any occasion and any outfit‚Äîtake them to work or to brunch; carry one every day or bring it on vacation. 
 Prada Ouverture small leather bag  See Price Prada Ouverture large leather bag  See Price  Prada Ouverture large leather bag  See Price Prada has long been intertwined with the art world, often collaborating with artists and borrowing elements from different movements as inspiration for its collections. In fact, the Ouverture bags aren't the brand‚Äôs first Bauhaus-style pieces. The 2014 spring collection referenced the same principles‚Äîand had everyone clamoring for color-blocked coats and dresses the second they were sent down the runway . Other iconic examples over the years have come from all corners of the fashion world. In 1965, Yves Saint Laurent debuted a collection of six dresses paying tribute to the designs of Mondrian. 1950s and 1960s Pucci is synonymous with mod, geometric color-blocking. The Hungarian Bauhaus painter L√°szl√≥ Moholy-Nagy has directly inspired designers such as Rei Kawakubo and Andr√© Courr√®ges. And London designer Mary Katrantzou‚Äôs winter 2018 collection included prints that paid homage to a series of posters from the 1923 Bauhaus Exhibition in Weimar, Germany. It was at that exhibition that Walter Gropius, founder of the school, established the Bauhaus movement‚Äôs simple yet revolutionary concept for the time: combining fine art (like painting and sculpture) with applied art (like furniture design or industrial design).  After the horrors of World War I, Germany‚Äôs artists and designers were faced with a conundrum: how to create a new aesthetic that stripped away the excesses of the past, and provided a sense of tidiness, order, and meaning in a rapidly evolving world.  Bauhaus aimed to provide a sense of tidiness, order, and meaning in a rapidly evolving world. Throughout the 20s, the main principles emerged. The languid, organic, and decorative style of turn-of-the-century Art Nouveau was replaced with bold shapes and strong color-blocking. The aesthetic of the Arts and Crafts movement, which were rooted in nature and folk styles, were swapped for simplicity and geometric purity.  In Bauhaus Stairway (above), painter Oskar Schlemmer focuses on the modular shapes of the human form; L√°szl√≥ Moholy-Nagy rejected human figures altogether in favor of striking abstractions. Even objects for the home were reduced to their most functional forms: Marianne Brandt‚Äôs tea service, created in the mid-1920s, is composed solely of its most essential shapes. 100 years down, it seems unlikely the Bauhaus influence will subside anytime soon. When political turbulence swept through Germany in 1933, the school‚Äîthen located in Berlin‚Äîclosed. As its leaders fled Nazi Germany, the Bauhaus influence was scattered to cities around the world. From Chicago to Tel Aviv, the Bauhaus influence would trickle down throughout the twentieth and twenty-first century in unexpected places. 100 years down, it seems unlikely the Bauhaus influence will subside anytime soon.

 The actress and entrepreneur recalls her greatest hits throughout the years.  Logging countless miles on the red carpet over the years has taught Goop founder Gwyneth Paltrow a thing or two about shoes. This month, she‚Äôll share that hard-won wisdom with the world in a capsule collection with stiletto sultan Christian Louboutin. Billed as a ‚Äúmini shoe wardrobe,‚Äù the collaboration offers Paltrow‚Äôs take on the ideal ankle boot, loafer, and work and evening heels. ‚ÄúWe wanted it to be flirty and fun but not too trendy or statement-seeking," she says of the collection. "Every woman needs a great black heel. There's something very Helmut Newton-y about our version, but the bow gives it a sweet touch." For inspiration, Paltrow looked to her vast, Louboutin-heavy archive of shoes from red carpets past. "Christian sent me sketches, and he completely understood what I wanted," she says. "He has an incredible mix of magic, talent, and focus." Here, she recalls six standout styles she loves from years past.  Stella McCartney is one of my best friends, so I was so happy to be her date to the ‚ÄúAlexander McQueen: Savage Beauty‚Äù gala at the Met Museum‚Äôs Costume Institute in 2011. I was lucky enough to wear some of his designs, and the night was such a great tribute to him. This is one of Stella‚Äôs gowns that have real wow factor. I paired it with Fred Leighton jewelry and super-high nude satin Louboutin platforms. The height of the shoe was empowering and flattering, which is necessary with such a high slit! I kept the shoes and rediscovered them years later when I was packing up my place in New York. This night was magical. I‚Äôm wearing Gucci, and my stylist helped me put this look together for last year‚Äôs Art + Film Gala at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. It was an event honoring the artist Robert Irwin and the filmmaker Kathryn Bigelow. The museum is wildly inspiring for us L.A. residents, and I love taking my kids there for a cultural experience. I had also just been named CEO of my company, Goop, by our board, and stepping into that role was a major professional milestone for me. As for the dress, it was so unique‚Äîshort, sexy, with an incredible neckline and sleeves. Gucci creative director Alessandro Michele is such a genius. These gold strappy heels were just the right complement. Bubblegum-pink suede shoes with a pink Prada dress to match! This was a total Elizabeth Saltzman moment‚Äîshe‚Äôs my stylist. I was at the National Movie Awards in London in 2010, and I‚Äôm sure that her dream was for me to look like a mix of Park Avenue lady and Catherine Deneuve: the bouffant, the eyeliner, the classic silhouette. And clearly she succeeded. I definitely held on to these Louboutins‚Äîthey‚Äôre the perfect shade of pink. I have a storage area where I save a lot of the shoes I‚Äôve worn to major events like the Grammys and the Oscars. I couldn‚Äôt even begin to tell you how many pairs I have. Here I am with my great friend Beyonc√© at the 2011 Grammy Awards, around the time that I was guest-starring on The version of ‚ÄúForget You‚Äù that I sang on the show had become a hit, and I had just performed it onstage with Cee Lo Green. Beyonc√© played a huge part in helping me get through that performance alive, and you can see by my smile how relieved I was that I hadn‚Äôt totally embarrassed myself. After I sang I went back to watch Arcade Fire play, and they won Album of the Year, which was really cool. I‚Äôm wearing a sheer black Monique Lhuillier minidress with these Christian Louboutin architectural heels. Oh, man, I wish I still had them. Alas, they were loaners. These Dsquared2 platforms marked the beginning of a long statement-shoe phase in my life. It was 2008, and I was just starting to venture out again into the public eye after having been home with my kids for a couple of years. I‚Äôm at a press conference in Rome for with Robert Downey Jr., who is one of my favorite people, and the rest of the cast, and there were interviews, photo calls, and all the rest. I‚Äôm wearing a black Preen minidress, which seemed like an interesting choice for day at the time. I remember getting compliments on the shoes, which I archived. I try to hold on to everything so I can give them to my daughter, Apple, someday. This was at a post- Oscars party after I performed a song called ‚ÄúComing Home‚Äù at the Academy Awards in 2011. I was a wreck‚Äîit was the most nervous I‚Äôd ever been about performing in my life. My body wasn‚Äôt responding to my brain; I literally didn‚Äôt know how to walk from point A to point B. So before I went onstage, I chased three beta-blockers with a beer, which was way too extreme because I couldn‚Äôt feel my hands. I recall being so happy to be done with the performance portion that I couldn‚Äôt wait to get inside and have a drink with a bunch of my girlfriends. I wore a Michael Kors gown, a Jimmy Choo clutch, Forevermark earrings, and Christian Louboutin shoes‚Äîsparkly with a slight platform and pointy toes, and perfect with the dress.
 Iconic. If you were asked to envision Lady Gaga's idea of "casual dinner attire", you might actually come up with something pretty close to this iconic Christian Siriano look. The singer stepped out in New York City last night (May 24) wearing a striking red dress from the designer's fall 2018 collection along with diamonds, silk gloves and retro shades.  Following her suggestion last November that she would take a rest from music, Gaga was forced to cancel several dates of her European tour due to ill health and specifically "severe pain that has materially impacted her ability to perform live". So it's kind of great to see her out and about and looking so radiant. Earlier this month, reports emerged that she is launching a makeup line called Haus Beauty after she filed for a trademark in February.
 Bras clasped in the front or no bra at all!  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. It has recently come to my attention via a viral Twitter thread that some people are out of their damn minds. Let me elaborate: apparently, there's an entire class of people out there HOOKING THEIR BRAS BEHIND THEIR BACKS. As in, they blindly feel around for the right hook and just hope to the gods that they find it.  My question to those people: do you also close your eyes before buttoning your shirt? Do you do your belt backwards and just hope you get the right hole? What is the reason for this unnecessary difficulty you're inflicting upon your own morning routine?  
  A lot of other people are on my side, according to a tweet originally posted by user @nakaimosu, which is now getting a LOT of attention. hey y‚Äôall how do you put on a bra?? with the clasp in front of you and then turn it around, or putting the bra on regularly and clasping it from the back ??? I GOTTA KNOW pic.twitter.com/w0wLSZvuXe The post asks: "hey y‚Äôall how do you put on a bra?? with the clasp in front of you and then turn it around, or putting the bra on regularly and clasping it from the back ??? I GOTTA KNOW." People are now fighting to the death over their answers. There are those who swear by option A (the right answer, don't you dare @ me), clasping it in the front and then turning it around.  the first way is the only way to do it Then, there's those in option B, who prefer to fumble around behind their backs for what I can only assume is roughly six minutes before finding the right hook. people who do the blue are WEAK pic.twitter.com/P87vzQdIgu On top of that, you've got a whole bunch of utter maniacs who pull their already-clasped bra over their head like a shirt, which I would assume wreaks utter havoc on their elastic band. Put it on like a shirt ü§† i put it on like a t-shirt There's another group of hooligans who step into their bra like a skirt and pull it all the way up to their boobs.  i literally clasp it and then step into it like a skirt n pull it up üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüíÄ And then there's this person who does all of the above depending on the day. I mix and match. Sometimes I'm blue, other days I'm red, lots of times I'm a sports bra, often I'm no bra.My boobs do not know what treat they are in for on a daily basis. Gotta keep it fun for them This is utter madness and that's all I have to say about that.

 We all need to take a moment to watch the designer's powerful show. Last night, Pyer Moss designer Kerby Jean-Raymond brought the fashion set to Brooklyn's Weeksville neighborhood for a show that was just as impactful as its location. Weeksville, one of the country‚Äôs first free black communities, was founded by African-American James Weeks in 1838, just 11 years after slavery was abolished in New York. Jean-Raymond, a native of the historic neighborhood, presented his Spring 2019 collection at the Weeksville Heritage Center, an institution dedicated to preserving the community's African-American culture. The venue served as the perfect backdrop for a collection that celebrated black culture to the fullest while sending a powerful message not only to the fashion industry but the whole world.   "See us now?," one look asked, while another t-shirt read, "Stop calling 911 on the culture," referencing the many recent news stories of white people calling the police on black people for no just reason.  ‚ÄúSTOP CALLING 911 ON THE CULTURE‚Äù -@pyermoss pic.twitter.com/XHYtBvvZoh But Jean-Raymond took his message beyond statement-making t-shirts, tapping black artist Derrick Adams to create 10 new works for the collection. The portraits, which feature black families partaking in everyday activities, were transformed into several pieces for the collection, including flowing, hand-painted tunics and a Swarovski-embellished gown showing a father holding his baby.  Rounding out the collection, Pyer Moss collaborated with FUBU, the '90s-era streetwear brand founded by Daymond Johns. Pieces included a yellow leather cropped vest and a gown featuring a reimagined FUBU logo. In a world of Supreme, Off-White, and Vetements, it was a throwback to one of the OG brands who did streetwear first.  As if the historically significant runway location and clothing itself wasn't moving enough, a gospel choir sang Stevie Wonder's "Heaven Is 10 Zillion Light Years Away," as the all-black cast of models walked the show. It was a goosebumps-inducing moment, despite the fact that it all unfolded in the rain.  Gospel finale at @pyermoss in historic Weeksville, one of the first free black communities in the US, was a moment, even in the rain #nyfw pic.twitter.com/Jl1V6L1Oyz During a time when the fashion industry (and entire world, for that matter) is still struggling to combat racial inequalities, a black designer staging such a powerful and unapologetically black show is exactly what New York Fashion Week needed. And it's something that deserves everyone's attention.  Watch this important piece of black fashion history!

 6 chic looks that'll also keep you warm. Mercury is in freefall and the only thing you want to wear is your duvet‚Äîwe get it. But take note: The winter chill doesn‚Äôt mean you have to put your style sensibilities on ice. ‚ÄòTis the season for cozy chic: cocoon coats; rich, opulent textures; and bohemian details that will keep you warm AND stylish. In other words, some serious statements.  Read on for six ways to hack the cold with a serious dose of cool.  Check Please A checkered pattern ‚Äî whether presented via geometric slimline trousers or a floaty skirt ‚Äî is a winter staple. Play on the masculinity of the print with men‚Äôs inspired add-ons, such as loafers or a lean, sleek coat (like this one from Maximilian), and keep the rest of your look simple and elegant.   Shear Genius The brilliance of a shearling jacket is two-fold: Firstly, it‚Äôs incredibly warm. Second, it offers a rugged vibe that perfectly balances city-inspired style cues. Pair one with polished hair and statement earrings, and offset the structure of the jacket by throwing on a sweater over a silk dress‚Äîextra points for multiple, warming layers.  Haute Normcore Think #OldC√©line: pragmatic, roomy silhouettes; a focus on tailored separates; discreetly luxurious knitwear; simple accessories; and sumptuously thick textures. These chic staples facilitate busy lives and insulate on the go. After all, isn‚Äôt comfort the ultimate form of luxury? Curate your look around a carefully-chosen coat in warm neutrals ‚Äî think ecru, white, and taupe ‚Äî in a cozy texture, like this shearling option from Maximilian. Boho Luxe A favorite term of those perennially chic Parisians, "BoBo" mixes bourgeois tendencies with bohemian flair, offering a sort of relaxed, hippie-luxe aesthetic. To achieve this, mix animal accents such as snakeskin finishes and leopard prints with plush fabrics like velvet and shearling. Extra points for updating nostalgic silhouettes (like flares) with modern details (like fun prints).  Southwest Style A look favored as much by editors running between shows in New York as celebrities clambering out of cars, the classic Canadian Tuxedo (otherwise known as double denim) is perfectly balanced with Fall/Winter 2019‚Äôs trending hue: camel.  Layer a pair of cropped jeans and an indigo denim jacket with a cozy teddy coat and a neutral boot for a stylish day look. Add polished, ladylike extras such as a frame purse or statement earrings to balance out the hard-wearing denim and keep things low-key sophisticated.

 It was the collection that got him fired from Perry Ellis.  Fashion's infatuation with '90s nostalgia isn't slowing down anytime soon. The latest revival comes in the form of Marc Jacobs' famous 1993 collection for Perry Ellis that shaped the decade's grunge look‚Äîand ultimately led to him being fired from the brand.  Despite being blasted by fashion critics, the range of grunge pieces became some of the decade's most defining looks and went on to kickstart Jacobs' career. So it only makes sense that now, as fashion continues to look back to the '90s, Jacobs bring back the iconic pieces under his own namesake brand 25 years later.  With a capsule collection dubbed 'Redux Grunge Collection 1993/2018 Marc Jacobs,' Jacobs is reissuing a total of 26 looks from the collection he originally designed for Perry Ellis. The looks will include ready-to-wear, jewelry, shoes and accessories, all made in the original prints, fabrics and embroideries. Prices range from $35 for socks to $1,200 for the suede overcoats.  "The ‚ÄòGrunge‚Äô collection epitomized the first time in my professional career I was unwavering in my determination to see my vision come to life on the runway, without creative compromise," Jacobs said in a statement from the brand.

 The actress and activist joins the #AerieREAL Role Models campaign.  Jameela Jamil believes in a no-filter kind of world.  The British actress/activist, who has been tapped by Aerie to star in its new #AerieReal Role Models campaign, is on a mission to make women confident in their own bodies‚Äîwhether that's calling out brands and celebrities for airbrushing images, or accusing A-listers like Cardi B, Iggy Azalea, and the Kardashians for promoting diet "Fit Teas" on Instagram. Jamil knows we're not yet in The Good Place, but she's working really hard to make wherever it is we are, better. Most notably with her I Weigh community, a movement she started in 2018 that encourages women to weigh themselves in life experiences rather than kilograms or pounds.  "There is a real rebellion happening, and a real revolution," Jamil tells BAZAAR.com. "I didn't realize how tired and done women are with being routinely abused and made to feel not good enough."    Jamil believes that Aerie, which eliminated Photoshop from all its imagery five years ago, is one of the few brands that strives to reflect everyday life. "And they're not doing it now that it's become trendy, or after I started screaming about airbrushing. Back in 2014 they stopped airbrushing their photographs and I think that was a really massive step in the right direction for women, and for young people everywhere." A diverse group of inspiring women join Jamil in the Aerie campaign, including model Iskra Lawrence, actresses Busy Philipps and Samira Wiley, poet Cleo Wade, gold medal Paralympian Brenna Huckaby, Olympic gymnast Aly Raisman, and motivational speaker Molly Burke. "There were so many wonderful women on-set that day," Jamil remembers. "I was very star-struck by Samira Wiley...what an incredible advocate she is for women, and for people, regarding sexuality."  In a phone call with BAZAAR.com, Jamil got real about body image, her I Weigh movement, the dangers of "cancel culture," and how the fashion industry can be better. Harper's BAZAAR:You call out celebrities and brands for their use of Photoshop and promoting unhealthy products like "Fit Teas," which seems to have sparked some backlash. Jameela Jamil: I think maybe two female journalists said that I was too slim or too conventionally attractive to speak out about the shaming of women's appearances. That's a hilarious device to control this conversation and stop it from happening. If you are not thin, or you're not conventionally attractive, then you're "jealous and bitter," and therefore are not taken seriously in the argument. And if you do have those attributes, then you're considered too privileged to have the conversation. Therefore, who gets to have the conversation? Nobody. And then we continue abusing women to make them buy things that they don't necessarily need. The media wants to portray the idea of a backlash because that makes a good story. There's a backlash against society, and shaming, and the culture. I've had nothing but mass support. Occasionally, I'll be rightfully critiqued for my approach and then I take a look at myself and I learn, and I grow with the public.  This thanksgiving I want to know... What do you weigh? Send your answers to @i_weigh A post shared by  Jameela Jamil (@jameelajamilofficial) on Nov 22, 2018 at 7:55am PST HB: What's your advice to women who want to challenge the status quo, but are afraid to do so? JJ: Part of that comes down to their fear, and this new culture of woke-bashing, which we need to be a little more careful with. If someone makes a single mistake, or a misstep, or made a mistake 10 years ago, we are never allowed to expect that they have grown and changed and evolved.  Rather than expecting everyone to be born perfectly, we have to make learning something [we're] excited to do together, because everybody has a blind spot. Everybody has a small amount of ignorance and that's okay as long as you continue to work on it. I think we could also make a little bit more room for errors, and be willing to give people a chance and a minute to learn, because there‚Äôs a lot of information coming at us all of a sudden in the last couple of years after so many years of erasure and tolerance. We need to do this together. Everybody makes mistakes. It doesn't make you evil‚Äîsometimes you could just be misinformed. Separating ignorance and evil is really important in order for us to encourage more allies. I know men who have made mistakes and therefore feel afraid to put themselves out there now as allies because they're worried that their mistakes will come back and haunt them from the past. I think all we have to do is publicly apologize for our mistakes and then do better. We can all do better. ‚ÄúSeparating ignorance and evil is really important in order for us to encourage more allies." HB: I love your pinned tweet where you admit you haven't always been the perfect feminist. I think you worded it so perfectly. JJ: I'm very happy to use my profile as an example of someone who made mistakes in the past and who wants to learn with everyone and be open about it. I'm not ashamed of my mistakes. I wish that I'd never, ever been ignorant, and I'd been all-knowing, like God. I haven't, but I think it's really cool that I'm willing to learn, and that people are willing to learn with me. I think people have found a safe space in my social media, where I share my knowledge, I show [myself] working things out. It is never too late to check yourself and right your wrongs. I used to be slut shamey, judgmental, and my feminism wasn‚Äôt intersectional enough. Nobody is born perfectly ‚Äúwoke‚Äù. Listen, read, learn, grow, change and make room for everyone. We aren‚Äôt free til ALL of us are free. HB: You admit that, in terms of slut-shaming and intersectionality, you haven't always been the perfect feminist in the past. How have you personally grown in those areas, and made progress?JJ: I have just made sure to shut up and listen and accept that I don't know everything. And listen to people when they are kind enough to talk to us. A great book is by Reni Eddo-Lodge, called Why I'm No Longer Talking to White People About Race. I've been listening to podcasts. I've been reading Roxanne Gay, who has great literature on feminism. Phoebe Robinson, both of her books are incredible, and her podcast, 2 Dope Queens, is also great. She really gives trans women a platform, and she makes sure to talk about issues within body positivity, or within the culture of being a black woman in the media, and in comedy‚Äîjust being a woman in comedy. She‚Äôs someone that I really, really look up to.  There's this wonderful woman on Twitter called Your Fat Friend. She's aggressively kind with her approach to activism and she dedicates her life to educating people, which is definitely not something she has to do. But she's taken it upon herself. I've unfollowed all toxic and empty, patronizing entities on social media, and anything that tells me something that is not important to my life, or anyone trying to sell me things that are not important to my life.  "Things that are very normal to have, like cellulite and stretch marks, I have a plethora of. And I'm no less of a woman, and I'm no less sexy for it." I don't really f*ck with correctional beauty products, because I think they're quite shaming about things that are very normal to have, like cellulite and stretch marks, which I have a plethora of. And I'm no less of a woman, and I'm no less sexy for it. And I'm no less worthy of being loved because of those things, so I don't do any of that. I don't spend my money on that. HB: What‚Äôs the most surprising thing you've learned since starting the I Weigh movement? JJ: That I'm not alone. I'm not the only one who's tired of the bully outside of my head and the bully inside my head. I didn't realize how tired and done women are with being routinely abused and made to feel not good enough. Like, if they're not fitting this straight, white, patriarchal gaze and within that narrative, that they're just not enough. There is a real rebellion happening, and a real revolution, and it feels like a really exciting time to be part of this. This movement has been going on forever, but I don't think it's ever had the kind of mainstream success it‚Äôs finally having now. And I think that's thanks in no small part to social media. As much as it's been a massive problem, it's also been a big part of us realizing that we have a shared experience. And we're all just done. HB: If there was one thing you'd like to see change in the fashion industry, what would it be?JJ: Sample f*cking sizes! I‚Äôm a size 6 and 5'10", and I can't fit into most samples. What is going on? If I have to be shot for press, which I‚Äôm contractually required to do for my show, I have to wear these clothes in order to be shot in these magazines. If I can't fit into the clothes, I can't be shot in a magazine, therefore I cannot fulfill my contractual obligation. They don't let you wear your own clothes. They take your size weeks in advance, and they know what size you are, and you turn up and so much of the time, the samples are way too small. I can fit one leg in a pair of pants, nothing goes over my knees. Then you kind of self-shame, like I've done something wrong by not fitting into this Gap Kids dress. It's not shame on me, it's shame on them! It took me into my thirties to realize that. Shame on them, because all of us are expected to be small enough to fit into these tiny samples because the designers don't want to use more material, or the designers just think a hip bone is better for a skirt to hang off of. I don't know what the motivation is, but for whatever reason these samples are tiny, so everyone has to shrink themselves into this one sample size.  "It's making everyone feel like there's something wrong with them." Then in the magazines, all you see is the same-sized women. From every ethnicity, every background, every age. Women get into their fifties, when their metabolisms have definitely slowed down, and they're still maintaining the size of a 15-year-old model. This doesn't always happen naturally. In fact, most of the time it isn't natural and they're having to go to extremes in order to maintain that size. But the women reading the magazines don't know this, they just think that's the normal size, and that they are a failure for not being able to fulfill the size that Hollywood and the entire fashion industry seems to seamlessly achieve. Then these models take pictures of themselves eating a thick slice of pizza, or a big bowl of spaghetti, in a luxury hotel in their underwear with zero percent body fat. It's making everyone feel like there's something wrong with them. It all begins with the sample sizes. Make the samples too big‚Äîspend the money on a little bit extra material and then at least if someone is too small for them, we can bulldog it, we can clip it. But to start from too small is so unkind to an entire gender who are so hungry. We‚Äôre so hungry! This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.

 Meet Nodaleto. And shop it here, of course. Julia Toledano is fashion royalty. The daughter of chairman and CEO of LVMH Fashion Group Sidney Toledano, may have luxury style in her DNA, but she took her own path to fashion stardom: first studying law, then working as a fashion journalist, taking design classes at London College of Fashion, and finally embarking on the launch of her own shoe brand last spring, Nodaleto, with business partner Olivier Leone.  Harper's BAZAAR met Toledano at The Webster during Fashion Week on the eve of her brand's launch party at the chic SoHo boutique. Outfitted in a flowing chestnut silk dress by The Row and white platforms of her own design, this pretty and petite Parisian-raised designer is confident in her brand's sure vision. Below, she shares advice from her dad, her own unique perspective on shoes, and why Nodaleto was all about the right timing and making good on a childhood dream.  Nodaleto has a lot of meanings for me. But let‚Äôs start from the beginning. Nodaleto is an anagram of my last name, Toledano. I really wanted to put my legacy in the brand‚Äîa mix of my Mediterranean cultural heritage and how I grew up combined with a fashion education in Paris and my own vision for the design. Nodaleto is a lot of spontaneity, a child‚Äôs dream that I always had in my head.  I was thinking of the architecture that I love, and a lot of art and artists‚Äîfrom Verner Panton, the houses in Casablanca (Villa Zevaco), the Steal House in L.A. (clean lines, open to the world), and the Palais Bulle by Pierre Cardin. I get my inspiration from furniture design, to architecture,  a very famous teenage movie from the ‚Äô00s or TV shows like Friends. The summer collection signifies a bridge between a teenager becoming a young woman. All the different steps that we know, from the transition to adulthood, how we want to feeling sexier, more mature, daring a little more. I think it was a question of time and timing. I have always been obsessed with shoes, I designed shoes for fun since I was a child. I knew I wanted to launch my brand one day, I just didn‚Äôt know when and how to begin. It was a question of timing. I wanted to be ready to express Nodaleto the best I can. I always wanted to create a mix between the classic luxury shoes and the one-time fashion crush we have on designer shoes. I‚Äôve always had a special relationship with shoes. Every happy moment of life has become an excuse to buy a new pair of shoes: my birthday, the end of the school year, sometimes for comfort after a breakup. To put on a new pair of shoes gives you confidence. It‚Äôs the ultimate feminine accessory. My collection of shoes is like a family; they have some elements in common‚Äîthe shape, structure‚Äîbut they all have their own personality. I like exploring different styles. For me, it‚Äôs about a shape and structure, but I like having fun with accessories, jewelry, hats, and bags. I‚Äôve always been more crazy with special pieces that can add that twist to more classics basics. I like that a fancy pair of shoes can change the whole silhouette and give a woman the confidence and power she needs. Put myself into the identity of the brand and believe in my designs. But more than anything, the product has to be my focus. I have to take care of every detail of the manufacturing and never compromise on quality. I‚Äôve liked fashion since I was very young. It‚Äôs always been my passion, but I just put it to the side and gave myself time to grow a bit. It was my dream to create a brand, but I wanted to wait for the right time. I really appreciate that I spent time as a young fashion journalist. Now that I have this background, I just feel that it‚Äôs complementary. I like to create a story for each of the shoes with Olivier. Nodaleto is a poem‚Äîwe like editing, creating our own content. It‚Äôs not just about a product, we want to create a whole universe around Nodaleto.  I always compare Nodaleto to a woman in general, she has different desires and perspectives depending on those different moments of her life. So like me, I‚Äôm a young woman who wants to challenge myself. Nodaleto is like a contemporary woman‚Äôs diary, she‚Äôs growing up, experiencing, and living adventures.

 Teddy coat, check. Faux-fur boots, check.  Did you make your fall fashion wish list (and check it twice) yet? If not, consider this a friendly reminder before you're stuck with too-thin-to-wear cotton dresses and sandals in that 55-degree weather. For everyone else who has an on-going list of things to buy (hello, that's me), apologies. I am about to add more fall-friendly must-haves for consideration. The silver lining here is that every single product is from Amazon‚Äîthe place where you can find a sweater for under $40. It won't take much spending to outfit yourself in fall's newest trend pieces, so make room for our favorite fall style finds on your wish list now. Google "teddy coats" and you'll see¬†the trend is still alive and flourishing this season. The textured outerwear is gaining steam again in various styles, from color-blocking to neon colors, but opt for the original hues like this autumnal fall brown¬†to keep it classically tasteful.¬† There are so many ways to wear this dress for the cooler temperatures ahead. You can cover up with a blazer, tuck a turtleneck underneath, or throw an oversize sweater on top so only the lower half shows in a "is it a dress or is it a skirt?" illusion.¬† If you love¬†Dr. Martens and already have combat boots from them, go for this Chelsea ankle boot variation. You can wear right now all the way into winter, thanks to the¬†warm faux fur lining on the inside. The soles are also slip-resistant, so don't worry about that invisible patch of ice on the sidewalk. A baggy¬†turtleneck you can shrink into and not feel guilty about wearing six out of the seven days of the week. This top comes in eight other colors and, most importantly, according to customers, isn't itchy. Buy in your regular size unless you want an even slouchier look.¬† When you're all bundled up, it's easy to forgo jewelry. This pearl bracelet will convince you to do otherwise. The shiny iridescent shapes coupled with multicolored beads deserves to see the daylight, so wear the piece by itself or with a few other delicate gold chains.¬† The one feature that makes this blazer different than the other ones hanging in your current closet is the built-in belt. The natural waist-cinching design makes you look instantly put together even if you just wear this with jeans. Throw on a pair of heels and earrings and you'll be ready to head out the door in minutes.¬† Tired of #sweaterweather? This black top with sheer puff sleeves is the one-piece you need to spice up your shirt options for fall. Since nothing else is see-through, you can definitely wear this to work tucked into a pair of jeans or trousers.¬† If you didn't know this luxury shoe brand was sold on Amazon, now you do. You can find a wide array of styles, from loafers to heels and boots. One of our favorites is this skinny sock boot with a pointed toe. It's a sleek and versatile everyday shoe to rock with jeans or underneath a dress. This outerwear is tagged as one of Amazon's "best sellers" and has over 7,000 reviews. One person wrote "It's a decent thickness down jacket that stands up to Michigan winters" while another wrote, "No. Doesn't hold up to Seattle weather. Soaked thru to clothes underneath." Though the jacket is cute and looks luxe, reviews on the quality of the piece are mixed. Some seemed to have gotten the coat in excellent condition, while others have discovered loose threads and holes. For the price and style, though, it doesn't hurt to order and try it on for yourself, and return if you don't like it. Say goodbye to your linen trousers and denim shorts. It's¬†all about jeans for the next few months. Paige makes some of the softest and most comfortable denim around, which you can now shop directly from Amazon. Add¬†this to your checkout cart along with miscellaneous items like nipple covers and iPhone cases.¬† Don't let the size of this scarf fool you in photos. It'll unroll into a length suitable to wear as a shawl or as a lap blanket when you're at your desk in the office. Aside from the multiple use, it'll protect your neck¬†on even the windiest of days. Pick your spirit animal (the skirt comes in two different snakeskin prints¬†and¬†a tiger print) to channel for the rest of fall. The midi length shows off your ankle boots while the side slit flashes a hint of your skin's fading tan from summer. Wear it tucked over or under a sweater. ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢For more stories like this, including celebrity news, beauty and fashion advice, savvy political commentary, and fascinating features, sign up for the¬†Marie Claire newsletter.

 The designer was found dead of apparent suicide in her New York apartment this morning.  Fashion designer Kate Spade has been found dead at her New York City apartment in an apparent suicide, according to law enforcement officials.   According to reports, the iconic fashion designer was discovered unresponsive in her Park Avenue apartment this morning at 10:20 AM and immediately pronounced dead on the scene. She reportedly died by hanging. Confirming the news, the Kate Spade New York brand shared a statement on Twitter, writing, "Kate Spade, the visionary founder of our brand, has passed. Our thoughts are with her family at this incredibly heartbreaking time. We honor all the beauty she brought into this world." Spade started her namesake fashion label, Kate Spade New York, in 1993 as a handbag brand. In the years to follow, the designer expanded into ready-to-wear, jewelry, shoes, and more before leaving the brand in 2006. Most recently, she launched a new fashion brand, named Frances Valentine after her daughter, in 2016.  She is survived by husband, fellow designer Andy Spade, and their 13-year-old daughter, Frances Beatrix Spade.  Our thoughts are with the family of Spade at this time.  If you or someone you know is exhibiting warning signs of suicide, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-TALK (8255). 
 Princess Diana's niece looks flawless as always. Princess Diana's niece, Lady Kitty Spencer, continues to build her career as a model‚Äîthis time by booking a coveted role as Bvlgari's latest brand ambassador. Spencer has been working with Bvlgari for quite some time, but the new partnership gives her an official role with the brand. As Harper's BAZAAR UK reports, Spencer says of her new appointment:  Bvlagri notes that Spencer represents the brand's "fearless attitude," making her a perfect fit for the new position. Spencer has previously helped to raise funds for several charities that work with Bvlagri, including the Elton John Aids Foundation and Save the Children. Just last weekend, Spencer attended Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's wedding in Windsor. As she's Prince Harry's cousin, it's unsurprising that Spencer was invited to the royal wedding. Princess Diana's niece wore a stunning green floral gown by Dolce & Gabbana to the ceremony, along with bright orange heels, and a green fascinator. She accessorized the look with a simple, sparkly necklace: Lady Kitty is no stranger to the spotlight, and her Instagram account instantly caught the world's attention, particularly as she regularly showcases her chic outfits, including when she got to walk the runway for Dolce & Gabbana:  What a DREAM ‚ú®üí´ Walking for @dolcegabbana in the #DGSecretDiamonds Show üíé I love you guys so much, thank you for having me üíã [photo via @polymoda] #DGFW18 #DGWomen #DGFamily #MFW A post shared by  Kitty Spencer (@kitty.spencer) on Feb 25, 2018 at 7:18am PST
 How to wear the revitalized trend in 2018.  Once a taboo accessory reserved for tourist attire, the fanny pack has successfully staged a comeback and is now cooler than ever.

 That catsuit is fire... Gigi Hadid donned a fitted floral jumpsuit with a coordinating parachute by Mary Katrantzou on the Victoria's Secret 2018 runway last night, but that wasn't the end of her moment with a slim silhouette. The supermodel, who shared the famed catwalk with her sister Bella, walked the pink carpet in another standout catsuit later in the evening at the after-party.  
  Her shimmering white Atelier Versace catsuit features an off-the-shoulder shape as well as choker detail at the neck. Diagonal ruching at the waist makes for a flattering shape, while a pant that extends around the foot as opposed to cutting off at the ankle is super elongating‚Äînot that Gigi needs any help appearing long and lean. Clear PVC pumps with crystal embellishment complete the statement ensemble. Hadid kept her makeup neutral with pink blush, highlighter and a rosy lip with a subtle cat eye, with her dark blonde hair swept into a casual updo. The vibe is very Olivia Newton John in Grease done up in white with a Studio 54 mood.  Gigi returned to the Victoria's Secret runway for the first time since 2016, after taking last year's show off. The 23-year old walked with her famous sister while her mother and former reality star Yolanda Hadid watched. She was later seen at the after-party with sister Bella's boyfriend Abel Tesfaye, better known by his stage name, The Weeknd. The two were photographed together for the first time since Bella and Tesfaye officially reunited this past summer. Gigi's own boyfriend Zayn was not in attendance. 
 The model talks being empowered through style and her new collection with Revolve.  Whether she's on the red carpet, vacationing with her family, or expertly shutting down trolls on Twitter, Chrissy Teigen oozes the level of confidence and sexiness we all aspire to. After years of us admiring the model's sense of style, humor, and sex appeal, she's finally making it easier to channel her signature style with a new capsule collection she designed for Revolve.  The 36-piece collection spans from velvet pants to bodysuits, sexy dresses, and stiletto heeled boots, all offered in a neutral color palette. "These are the pieces that everybody is able to wear and mix and match and feel sexy and confident in. That's what the collection is really all about," Teigen told BAZAAR.com.   Ranging in price from $78-$268, the collection includes a variety of pieces the model can't wait to wear herself. But it's the pair of gold velvet booties that are currently holding the top spot as her favorite design, "The height is perfect, I'm kind of crazy about heel height. I don't want to teeter on the toes of my feet all the time, but I also don't want to wear kitten heels. They're so cool whether it's with a dope cigarette pant or little short shorts, or a boyfriend jean," Teigen gushed over the under-$200 boots.  Since feeling confident and sexy are the focal points of the Chrissy Teigen x Revolve collection, BAZAAR.com spoke with the model on how she uses fashion to feel confident, the trends she'd never wear, and the style lessons she plans to pass down to her daughter Luna. Below, the lessons we learned from Teigen.   1. Despite everything that's happening in the world, you can use fashion and self-care to feel empowered as a woman.  "Obviously you're never going to be able to shake what is happening in the world, I think it has everything to do with the fact that you feel happy and you feel good about yourself and just screw everybody else, honestly. If you feel good and you feel confident, sexy, comfortable, and beautiful, then that's really all that matters. I feel like if more people felt that way they wouldn't be so unhappy in their own lives. And there is obviously so much happening [in the world], but you can only take care of one person and that's yourself. So I think everyone needs to just focus on what makes them happy mentally, physically, everything." 2. Self-care is the key to confidence.  "I think self-care is the most important part of feeling confident. Taking care of yourself mentally and being able to take breathers...There is so much happening that it's really important that you feel like you're pulled together. There's so many stresses in the world right now that you want to be able to take care of yourself. For me, the most important thing is being surrounded by a really good group of people and a really good support system, there's nothing quite like that, honestly." 3. Wear what makes you feel good.  "There's a ton of trends I‚Äôll never wear and I'm jealous of the people that do get to wear them. I work with stylists that'll sometimes be rocking dope Birkenstocks with a pair of jeans and I'm like, 'What? I could never, ever in my life get away with that!' Then I look at people who can pull off those chic, backless Gucci loafer things and I just look so silly in things like that‚Äîthat's why I think confidence has so much to do with looking and feeling sexy. I'm not going to look as put together when I feel crazy‚Äîthat's when you know that confidence plays a high role in fashion. Being able to feel good about yourself is going to make anything you wear look good." 4. Take an extra 15 minutes in the morning to focus on yourself.  "I'm the kind of person where if I'm going out, I want to feel pulled together, but I don't want to necessarily look like I tried too hard. I think for me, it's all about being able to wake up and to have that extra 10-15 minutes to take care of yourself and your skin. Then, just kind of do this no make-up make-up look and feel cool in your outfit. For me, doing less just makes me feel so much happier mentally because I've never been good at really trying to pull full looks together head-to-toe. I can't do my own hair, I can't do all of this so it's easy to just throw something nice on and go." And as for what fashion lessons Chrissy plans to pass down to her daughter Luna? We can all learn a thing or two from them:  "Obviously the "less is more" thing‚Äîexcept when it comes to eyebrows! Not like less is more in the way of showing skin, but in that you really don't need to try so hard. Take off one piece of jewelry, less makeup is more‚ÄîI'm really about embracing the natural beauty. I think what's so great about living now is we actually do have this huge appreciation for diversity and different body types and different skin tones. With everything shitty that's happening, the one thing that's really changing about the world is that we have such an appreciation for uniqueness and in that regard, she's growing up in an amazing time of being able to feel comfortable in her own skin and not having to cover up whatever she finds are flaws. I mean, nowadays, flaws are uniqueness, they kind of bring out the best in us and hopefully she's going to really try and embrace that. But you never know, 'cause she's my daughter, so she might have her own thoughts on that and for all I know she might love Hot Topic. Who knows? I'll accept her no matter what she likes.  
 Will more brands follow suit?  Three seasons ago, Rodarte was one of the first major brands to move its New York Fashion Week show to Paris. But now, the Los Angeles-based fashion house is making its big NYFW comeback this September.  Designers Kate and Laura Mulleavy took to Instagram last night to announce the news, writing, "We are excited to announce we will be showing our SS19 collection during NYC Fashion Week! We are thrilled to create the show with our amazing team."  According to WWD, Rodarte's New York Fashion Week show is slated to take place on Sunday, September 9, but a specific location has yet to be announced. For its venture to Paris, the brand showed its collections during Couture Week in July. Last season, it unveiled its Fall 2018 collection with a series of portraits instead of a traditional runway show.  The portrait series starred Kirsten Dunst, who used the opportunity to announce her pregnancy, along with Grimes, Tessa Thompson, Rowan Blanchard, and more.  This season, it looks like Rodarte will not only be returning to its original show location of New York, but also to a traditional runway show instead of private appointments or a portrait series.  Of course, Rodarte's return to NYFW raises the question: will more designers follow suit? The brand was just one of many taking part in a mass exodus from the New York fashion calendar, including Proenza Schouler, Altuzarra, Tommy Hilfiger, Thom Browne, and more. Proenza Schouler has already announced that it too will be returning to New York Fashion Week this September after several seasons showing in Paris. 
 The highlight of 2017 is finally here.  With every red carpet, music video and carnival look Rihanna wears, she furthers her status as the ultimate style icon. From the Met Gala to the "Wild Thoughts" video, we've all wanted to wear one of her Bad Gal looks at one point or another and now, we finally can (well, sort of).  The singer unveiled her new Fenty for Stance sock collections featuring some of her greatest looks immortalized in sock form. The two box sets‚ÄîRihanna Award Show Box and Rihanna Music Video Box‚Äîlet you wear Riri's red carpet style and music video looks on your feet (which is all us mere mortals can really ask for).  First, there's the iconic crystalized naked dress she wore to receive the 2014 CFDA Style Icon Award:    And then, the ultra-luxe and extravagant yellow Guo Pei look she shut down the 2015 Met Gala in:    Iconic.  Along with some of her best red carpet looks, Bad Gal Riri's memorable music video outfits were transformed into socks of their own too.  There's a pair featuring Rihanna's look from her "Work" video with Drake:  And the crystalized bra get-up from her "Pour It Up" video:   Unsurprisingly, all the socks already sold out‚Äîbut there's a chance the $48 box sets could be re-stocked. For those looking to cop a pair, you can monitor stance.com/rihanna to see if the Riri red carpet socks come back in stock. Fingers crossed.

 We'll take one of each, please. Re/Done co-founder Sean Barron and Attico co-founders Gilda Ambrosio and Giorgia Tordini's initial meeting was a classic fashion story. "I met Giorgia and Gilda at a dinner in Paris. I felt they were super cool," Barron tells BAZAAR.com. And like many good fashion dinners before it, a great collaboration was born from it. "In passing we said it would be fun to do something together, not really thinking it through. But a month later they dropped by our studio in LA and we started the project." Attico is a uniquely Italian brand, with two street style stars at the helm who have two very different approaches to dressing. One leans a little more posh and minimal, while the other is a little bit sportier and sexier‚Äîbut together, the brand hits just the right amount flashy; a little '80s, with some florals, some bold colors, and a little glitz. Putting those ideas onto Re/Done's beloved reworked vintage model sounds like a dream project. "We share a passion for taking the old and making it new again, so the partnership came out very naturally," Ambrosio explains.  The story the women wanted to tell through this partnership was "the ability see the beauty in old found dresses and upcycle them; finding something old and making it new." It's a modern concept with sustainability at its core. "We spoke about what inspired each of us and we were aligned on vintage and sustainable fashion. And we brought all of these to the collaboration," Barron says, "We wanted to explore fashion and sustainability using vintage and upcycling while exploring slightly different price points for each of us."  Tordini echoes a similar sentiment. "The most interesting aspect of this collaboration is the possibility to reconsider and re-manage your general idea and approach towards vintage," she says. The results are a mix of re-worked vintage, bold-shouldered floral mini dresses, Swarovski crystal embossed sweatshirts, high-waisted paper bag denim, and cargo pants. None of it is about basics. These are pieces to elevate a wardrobe and give a girl something fun to put on. "The general idea is proposing a metropolitan look to wear during daytime," Tordini explains. "The overall feeling is casual, but the possibilities to style the collection are potentially infinite. The most important thing is having fun in doing it." And it's almost sold out, so if you want in on the fun, it's now or never. Shop the collaboration on barneys.com, matchesfashion.com, re/done and more. 
 It‚Äôs all in the mix for the 74-year-old model and 'I Feel Pretty' actress. When I got the call offering me a role in Amy Schumer‚Äôs   I Feel Pretty,   I hadn‚Äôt made a movie in 10 years and was on my way to dive with great white sharks off the coast of Mexico. I didn‚Äôt have time to read the script before I got on the boat, but I said yes right away because I think Amy is an Epsilon Aurigae, by which I mean a bright star and a comedic genius.  The film chronicles a woman‚Äôs newfound confidence after she wakes from a fall in SoulCycle class believing she is the most beautiful creature on the planet. It‚Äôs very funny and also very instructive about silencing the negative voices in our heads. You don‚Äôt need to suffer a concussion to recognize that when you choose to send light out into the universe, other people will be attracted to you. My character, Lily Le Claire, is a beauty entrepreneur who is always in a little Chanel suit with matching accessories. I personally don‚Äôt believe in wearing everything expensive. I love Giorgio Armani blazers as much as the plastic water shoes I bought on a Greek island for $3. Forget the myth of one ‚Äúperfect‚Äù white T-shirt. To find the one that suits you, you must consider your skin undertone. If you‚Äôre pink, go for a creamy white, but if you‚Äôre yellow like me you‚Äôll want a bright white. I stock up at the Row and J. Crew. My number-one beauty essential is concealer that you can see your skin through. The best one I know is my own from when I had my Lauren Hutton Makeup line. I hear you can still find it on eBay. I also swear by Anastasia lipstick in a warm brown shade called Rust. It takes a long time to find your personal style. Most of us just sort of bump around in the beginning. I became a model to save money to travel and experience the colorful style of other cultures, like the Maasai of Kenya. I often carry woven rattan backpacks from Malaysia. I also like Gabriela Hearst‚Äôs Nina bag for an evening out. I‚Äôve had four operations on my leg following a motorcycle accident, so it‚Äôs goodbye to four-inch stilettos. Manolo Blahnik makes mid-heel slingbacks that feel like you‚Äôve wrapped your feet in a Shakespeare sonnet.  I love a line Diana Vreeland wrote to Yves Saint Laurent: ‚ÄúWhy must working women wear such drab colors?‚Äù I always try to wear a pop of something wonderful, vibrant, brilliant‚Äîcolors that feel alive.
 This is a movie waiting to happen. One of the most talked about models at NYFW was working at a Chipotle just 10 days ago, Daily Mail reports. Remington Williams walked for some of the biggest names in the business this past week, including Calvin Klein, Sies Marjan, and Marc Jacobs, and she looked amazing doing it. Not bad for a girl who was washing dishes at an Austin, Texas branch of the fast casual chain the week before.  Apparently a scout saw her scrubbing away and was like, "YOU! Come with me!" and she was like, "OK, tight." And now she's strutting about town wearing super nice shit and having the time of her life. Sometimes good things happen and that makes me happy and believe the world isn't garbage. Go on, Remington! The model is now preparing to head to Europe for all the shows, and she's practicing strutting in stilettos to get ready. "[I've been wearing] the heels to the grocery store and bodega near my apartment,' she said. 'Models do not get enough credit for walking in those crazy shoes‚Äîthey make it look so easy!" Of course, if she decides she hates modeling, I'm sure there will always be a place for her on the taco line. Hell, I might join. I love those sofritas! Delectable!

 Classic only begins to define it. Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis is undeniably one of the greatest style icons of the last century. Click through to see her most memorable looks through the years. Before she became the wife of a rising politician, Jacqueline Bouvier had polished debutante style down. An elegant long white dress is just the ticket. Jackie was a vision on her wedding day to John Kennedy in 1953. Recently, Megan Markle recently proved the boatneck wedding gown to be as timeless as we always knew it to be. All-white was a theme for Mrs. Kennedy, shown here in a white hat and another boat neck. Those white gloves finish the elegant idea. It's all about chic shorts and a little button-down while vacationing at the Kennedy compound in Massachusetts in 1953. That straw topper just adds to the easy, breezy summer vibe. Always a standout when black tie is called for, Senator and Mrs. Kennedy look the part of young-political-couple-on-the-rise perfectly here. That fitted bodice gown is perfectly timeless.  Consider it mom and baby style done right. Here, Jackie is pictured with her new daughter Caroline Kennedy in 1958 in a silk printed dress. A little shift dress in any pastel in always a good idea. Here, Kennedy is casual and chic at a picnic in the park. Another day, another shift dress. This one came in a bright pink and perfectly paired with her pearl choker and dazzling earrings.  Well known for her Oleg Cassini and Chanel suits, Kennedy was well aware that a great jacket and a set of pearls make the ladylike look.  A pillbox hat and a pair of white gloves don't hurt either.  Kennedy again donned gloves and a boatneck gown to attend a dinner at the Japanese Embassy in 1961. That simple bow ties up the luxe white look. For her first official photograph as First Lady in 1961, the Southampton-born beauty wore a simple long-sleeved sheath. This casual pose illustrated her easy elegance.  Always the lady, here she is pictured wearing a Chez Ninon suit during a tour in Vienna in 1961. A contrasting hat and shimmering broach serve as standout accessories. Does it get any prettier than pink Christian Dior? The First Lady attended an event at the White House in this memorable strapless gown. While her pink Chanel suit will go down in infamy, this little shift was worn during happier times. White gloves, pearls and pumps finish the idea. Are you seeing the shift theme? A simple shape that can handle any number of colors of prints, the shift was a go-to of the First Lady's in the early 1960s. For her state visit to India in 1962, Kennedy embraced the country's love of vibrant color. This orange-hued dress with bow detail was one of her many rainbow-hued ensembles for the excusion. As her state visit in India continued, three fashion go-to's remained: pearls, white gloves, and many bow details.  The early 60s were all about Palm Springs. Here, Jackie, Caroline, John Jr. and John F. Kennedy  hit the Cali hot spot in white Mommy and Me looks, save for JFK in a black suit.  Jackie looked regal in a strapless lavender gown, diamond drop earrings, and long white gloves during a ceremony at the National Gallery of Art.  A little suit is not only for state events. Jackie appears in a boxy number in a light hue at home with her son John Jr. in 1964. Although certainly a difficult time, Jackie used fashion as an armor, looking beautiful as always in a short-sleeved suit while attending a memorial for John F. Kennedy in 1965. Always a chic pair, the former First Lady is captured walking with her sister Princess Lee Radziwill in a nautical-inspired navy suit with gold buttons. Daughter Caroline and niece Anna opted for mini dresses.  As we head into the late '60s, Kennedy begins to embrace longer, leaner silhouettes. This gilded belt lends major glamour factor to her mint gown. In an iconic casual look, Kennedy-Onassis goes barefoot in Rome in 1968 in cropped white denim and a navy tee. Her signature oversized shades were also on display. Jackie wed Aristotle Onassis in 1968. Here, pictured with her groom, she takes her earlier shift looks into boho territory with embroidery and a longer pearl necklace.  Jackie proved less is more with a simple black turtleneck and classic watch. It's always time for mini A-line skirts and smart jackets, as worn here walking along the sidewalk in NYC in 1970. This whole ensemble wouldn't look a bit out of place in 2019.  Another iconic fashion moment, in a black turtleneck, trench and cool white trousers, while leaving the Claridges hotel in London in 1970. These sisters have Italian vacation style on lock. Jackie wears a belted polka dot maxi skirt, while Lee goes for khaki trousers and a navy top in Capri.
 Like supermodel mother, like supermodel daughter.  Kaia Gerber continues to follow in her supermodel mother's footsteps in more ways than one.  Yesterday, Cindy Crawford shared side-by-side school pictures of her own high school yearbook photo next to her 16-year-old daughter's school picture this year. Much like the two's runway and editorial comparisons, the resemblance in the mother-daughter yearbook photos is uncanny‚Äîdespite being taken over three decades apart.  Cindy captioned the photo, "School pics, now and then." Of course, neither Kaia nor Cindy's yearbook photo looks anything like the rest of ours did. From the eyebrows to the smile to the campaign-ready cheekbones, Kaia clearly inherited all of her mother's supermodel genes.  Though it's easy to become fixated on the mother-daughter duo's incredible resemblance, 16-year-old Kaia is busy carving out a modeling career of her own. This past September, the teenager made her runway debut at Calvin Klein's Spring 2018 show during New York Fashion Week. After that, she went on to dominate the runways in New York, London, Milan, and Paris‚Äîfrom Alexander Wang to Versace, Saint Laurent, Prada, Chanel and more.  Gerber has also landed campaigns for Marc Jacobs Beauty and Omega and covers of both Love Magazine and Teen Vogue. Most notably, however, the 16-year-old is already nominated for "Model of the Year" at this year's British Fashion Awards. After just one season of walking the runway, Kaia is already up against Bella Hadid, Gigi Hadid, Winnie Harlow, and Adwoah Aboah.  Cindy Crawford has, of course, been along Kaia's side every step of the way. And with a supermodel mom mentor like Cindy, this is only the beginning of Kaia's sure-to-be-legendary career. 
 Shop the heattech essentials before they sell out.   It's been a good week for affordable designer collaborations. First, Moschino x H&M dropped yesterday and now, Alexander Wang's highly-anticipated collection with Uniqlo is finally here.  The New York designer joined forces with Uniqlo for a collection utilizing the Japanese brand's signature heated technology. Just in time for winter, the collaboration of cold weather essentials includes heattech leggings, bodysuits, underwear, and turtlenecks. Offered in a range of five different colors (white, black, camel, gray, and neon green), the entire collection is under $40‚Äîmeaning you better shop fast before it sells out.  The pi√®ce de r√©sistance‚Äîand likely the first to sell out‚Äîof the collection are the heattech leggings. Made from the brand's warming fabric, the leggings are total game-changers for your winter wardrobe (and yes, the Alexander Wang branded waistband only makes us want them more).  The leggings are also offered in an "extra warm" heattech style for those who want a little more protection from the cold at $10 more. Like the less expensive pair, the extra warm leggings are offered in three different colors: gray, white, and black.  From ribbed turtlenecks to bodysuits and matching bras and underwear, Wang x Uniqlo has plenty of winter staples (all with heated technology) for under $40. Shop some of our favorite must-haves below and browse the full collection at uniqlo.com.
 Can we bring these back for spring, please? Just about every '90s trend has made its way back to the runways in the past five years. But today, Prada decided to bring back our favorite '90s furniture instead: blow-up chairs.  Guests attending the fashion house's Spring 2019 show were seated on clear inflatable blow-up chairs in lieu of traditional benches. New York Times fashion director Vanessa Friedman shared a first behind-the-scenes look at the seating situation on Twitter:   The seats at @Prada are big blow up squares #MFW pic.twitter.com/4i5NtHiuqs  And because you asked, here is Spike Lee sitting on one of the blow-up chairs: Looking fresh out of our favorite Delia's catalog, the inflatable chairs brought back some serious nostalgia. This is the chair that we all had to have in our cool teen bedrooms. The chair that we somehow thought was straight from the "future." And most importantly, the chair that gave us some of the most iconic Britney Spears merch of all time.  So does Prada's inflatable front row seating mean our favorite '90s chairs are about to stage a comeback? We can only hope so. If you don't want to wait until Spring 2019 to try the home decor trend, there are already some blow-up chair options to shop online.  Urban Outfitters has this clear and glitter seat:  And Amazon has this classic style available in four color options:   So long velvet millennial pink couches, it's been real. 
 Rihanna, Amal Clooney and Donatella Versace will host the "Heavenly Bodies" themed event. It's officially that time again: fashion's biggest night of the year‚Äîthe Met Gala‚Äîis just weeks away.  Always delivering the most show-stopping red carpet fashion, this year's Met Gala will be a religious event‚Äîquite literally‚Äîas the theme of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's next Costume Institute exhibit is, "Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination." Yes, the 2018 Met Gala will be tackling the influence of Catholicism in fashion‚Äîwhich is sure to stir up some controversy on the red carpet.    The "Heavenly Bodies" exhibition has, however, received the official stamp of approval from the Vatican. In fact, along with over 150 designer pieces, the Costume Institute's next big exhibit will also include 50 garments and accessories loaned from the Vatican. Other brands featured include Dolce & Gabbana and Versace, both of which have a history of using religious undertones in their designs, and more unexpected inclusions like Chanel and Valentino.  "We know it could be controversial for right wing or conservative Catholics and for liberal Catholics," head curator Andrew Bolton told the New York Times. But, he clarified that the exhibit focuses "on a shared hypothesis about what we call the Catholic imagination and the way it has engaged artists and designers and shaped their approach to creativity, as opposed to any kind of theology or sociology."  Though its unclear exactly how A-list attendees will navigate this year's tricky theme on the red carpet, expect to see plenty of symbolic religious undertones and perhaps, even a few bold statements on religion. Rihanna, Amal Clooney and Donatella Versace will be co-hosting this year's Met Gala‚Äîwhich already guarantees some pretty epic red carpet moments to come.    When it comes to dressing for Met Gala themes, Rihanna knows best. Last year, the singer won the red carpet in an avant-garde Rei Kawakubo-designed look that was also featured in the exhibition for "Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Gar√ßons: Art of the In-Between." Before that, she stole the show at the 2015 "China Through The Looking Glass" theme in an incredibly ornate yellow gown by Chinese couturier Guo Pei.    Despite consistently killing it on the Met Gala red carpet, this is the first time Rihanna will be co-hosting the event. This will also be Amal Clooney's first time hosting the event. Last year, Katy Perry and Pharrell Williams served as co-chairs for the Rei Kawakubo-themed Met Gala.    While a list of official celebrity attendees has yet to be confirmed, expect to see regular attendees including Sarah Jessica Parker, Madonna, Katy Perry, Kim Kardashian West (who's currently cleansing for the occasion), Kendall Jenner, Gigi and Bella Hadid and hopefully a Beyonc√© appearance.  The 2018 Met Gala will take place on May 7 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. 
 The designer drew inspiration from her mother-in-law, newspaper columnist Austine Hearst Gabriela Hearst‚Äôs late mother-in-law Austine Hearst was a reporter at The Washington Times-Herald who penned a society column called ‚ÄúUnder My Hat‚Äù in the 1940s. So when Gabriela decided to create her first-ever menswear collection (available at her New York flagship as well as Mr Porter and Bergdorf Goodman), she looked to Austine‚Äôs description of the ‚ÄúIdeal Male Fashion Plate‚Äù for sartorial inspiration. According to Austine,‚Äúmen should aim for nonchalance, individuality, without novelty.‚Äù Her platonic ideal of a fashionable man is one who tries ‚Äúnot to be too neat, too matched up, too color-schemed, and too snugly fitted.‚Äù The luxe separates in the Gabriela Hearst menswear collection including Japanese cotton t-shirts, artisanal knitwear, and roomy suiting look like just what every well dressed man needs.
 The ultimate way to transition your wardrobe from summer to fall.   This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. Emily Ratajkowski regularly rocks revealing outfits, but for NYFW, she became the definition of smart casual.  Attending the Daily Front Row lunch at The Park Loggia, Ratajkowski wore a black tuxedo suit, but in place of a shirt and bow tie, she opted for a white bikini top from her own line. The Las Olas Top features long string ties and comes in a range of colors. The model and actress was honored at the event as its Fashion Entrepreneur of the Year, so her tux-with-a-twist was the ideal outfit for the occasion, especially as it allowed her to promote her swimwear brand. On Instagram, Ratajkowski opened up about receiving the award, which was presented to her by Kathy Ireland. And Ratajkowski's bikini moment isn't the only time she's turned up the heat during New York Fashion Week. Stepping out for BAZAAR ICONS, the We Are Your Friends star wore a perfectly fitted, asymmetrical red dress by Zara.  btw this dress is Zara A post shared by  Emily Ratajkowski (@emrata) on Sep 7, 2019 at 8:58am PDT

 The creative director talks champagne and music.  Virgil Abloh has quite the resume, he runs his own label Off-White, recently became the menswear creative director of a little French brand you may have heard of... Louis Vuitton. Not to mention the DJ gigs, the IKEA home collaboration and now he designs champagne bottles and cases. Last week, Abloh, a bonafide purveyor of cool, celebrated his newest design project amongst some of his closest friends in New York. We chatted with the very busy man about where he finds his inspiration, and how he unplugs from it all.  Harper's BAZAAR: You've got a lot on your plate right now, why add this new project with Moet? Virgil Abloh: I don't really have a cut-off switch when it comes to design. I'm interested in making versions, or making products I feel can make a compelling statement. When Mo√´t reached out, I immediately had some ideas that I wanted to apply to the products.   HB: What keep you excited about design? VA: I'm mostly inspired by how people use something, or the reverence of a product‚Äî so I'm constantly inspired. For this project, I was inspired by the idea of what champagne means. How it can be symbolic of an achievement, a celebration, it has a sort of upper-echelon emotion attached to it. So the design I applied to it, as a figure of speech in a way, in my voice, using Helvetica and quotes, to say... treasure the moment, "do not drop," it's fragile. That was a way to, in contemporary speak, merge these two ideas together. HB: Where's the most glamorous place you've ever had champagne? VA: Here at the Mercer Hotel lobby HB: Where do you go for a decadent night out? VA: Probably the Mercer Hotel. It's always a hotel.... the Sunset Tower in Los Angeles, and Le Meurice in Paris.  HB: What do you do when you need to unplug? VA: Sleep [laughs] HB: You just launched a radio station? What kind of music will be played? VA: I'm already one episode down, working on the next. It's a mix of every genre that interests me... jazz, hip-hop, electronic, dance, techno/house. Anything that's good. I always listen to music as a backdrop, I hate silence. HB: You travel a lot, how do you spend your time on those long flights? VA: It's a little bit of work and sleep. I don't like sitting still, so the best way to pass time is watching films.  HB: Best films you've seen recently? VA: I saw Beautiful Boy in Los Angeles and Mid '90s.  You can buy Virgil Abloh's Mo√´t champagne for $80 here.  
 The sister duo behind First Aid Kit talk heartbreak, fashion must-haves, and on-the-go beauty secrets presented by our partner, Gucci. Songstress sisters Johanna and Klara S√∂derberg of Swedish folk band, First Aid Kit, are having a moment. The burgeoning duo released their new hit album, ‚ÄúRuins,‚Äù earlier this year and recently performed at the historic Beacon Theatre in New York City. Recognized not only for their original lyrics and perfect harmonies, the band‚Äôs stylish music videos and stage presence are also inspiring the fashion set, with Gucci taking notice.  What sets this album apart from your previous music?This is a break up album. It‚Äôs quite dark and melancholic. It‚Äôs more personal than our previous albums. Because of the lyrical content, we wanted to make this record a little rough and raw. It‚Äôs not perfect, but it feels very honest and heartfelt. We tried to achieve a live-feeling to the sound. We recorded with this incredible big session band all together in the same room. It was a very spontaneous and fun process. SHOP THE SHOOT Inspirations behind the album?The inspirations for the album came from so many different places. New discoveries like the band Big Thief, Angel Olsen, and Kevin Morby. But also, old time classics like Fleetwood Mac, Heart, and Gram Parsons.  "We're all in this together, we've all been through heartbreak in one way or another. We'll get through it."   What journey do you hope the listeners will take?We just hope the listener can relate to the songs and really take them in. For us writing these songs was very therapeutic, hopefully it feels the same way for the listener. Maybe when listening to ‚ÄúRuins‚Äù they can feel less lonely and more connected to the world.  We‚Äôre all in this together, we‚Äôve all been through heartbreak in one way or another. We‚Äôll get through it. You just performed at the Beacon Theatre‚Äîwhat does this mean to you?Performing at the Beacon was such a huge honor. We‚Äôd never been there before and were stunned by the beauty of the building. We got goosebumps standing on stage looking out at all the gorgeous scenery. It has such a regal and majestic vibe. The fact that so many of our musical heroes have played there before definitely influenced our performance. You can feel it in the air. It was an unforgettable evening. How does your music influence your style and vice versa?We are huge fashion fans, but the music always comes first. We want to look the way we sound; it all has to go together. We literally wear our influences on our sleeves. Whether it‚Äôs a nudie inspired suit √† la Gram Parsons or a fringe dress like one worn by Emmylou Harris. We‚Äôve always loved the music of the ‚Äò60s and ‚Äò70s. That whole era was so interesting in fashion too, so revolutionary and creative. Favorite Gucci pieces from the shoot?We loved everything from the shoot. It was such a dream to get to wear these pieces. Our favorite out of all them has to be the green jumpsuit. Because it fit like a glove and has the perfect ‚Äò70s retro vibe. We also fell in love with those sequined shoes as well. They are so dainty and cute, but badass at the same time.  SHOP THE SHOOT How has your personal style evolved over the years? Our style has changed a lot over the years. When we started out we both had short hair and a very unisex look. We wore flannel shirts, jeans, and boots. It was very basic. A few years later we started wearing a lot of long floral bohemian vintage dresses. With ‚ÄúRuins‚Äù we wanted to add a little bit more ‚Äò70s glam rock to our style. It‚Äôs a little darker and edgier, going with the sound of the record. These days our private style is more minimalist and functional. It‚Äôs nice to have that contrast between being on and off-stage. Putting on a stage outfit should be like a ritual, like entering a new world.  "Putting on a stage outfit should be like a ritual, like entering a new world."  How has Stockholm influenced your aesthetic?It‚Äôs definitely very inspiring to live in Stockholm. People do have some amazing style here, even though it can be really difficult to know how to dress in the freezing cold! Lately we‚Äôve seen a lot of Swedes move away from that minimalistic monochromatic look, instead trying more bolder colors and patterns. It‚Äôs refreshing.   Current fashion obsessions? Go-to uniforms?Our go-to uniforms at-the-moment must be either straight leg jeans, vintage t-shirts, and plaid blazer OR oversized colorful jumper over a midi length skirt or dress. Always worn with cowboy boots.   When touring, what skincare routine do you follow and what are your makeup must-haves?Since we fly a lot, moisturizing is key. We love sheet masks and wear them on long flights, we probably look ridiculous, haha. We try to use organic products whenever possible. It feels nice to use something that looks great that is also good or the skin, instead of using chemical products.
 Meghan carried the brand's midi-tote on her first official engagement in Nottingham. The Meghan Markle effect is in full swing. After her white coat sparked an internet surge earlier this week, the handbag that the former Suits star carried on her first official engagement with Prince Harry has immediately gained a lot of attention. The future royal teamed her navy coat from Canadian brand Mackage with a bag from Edinburgh-based label Strathberry for her first royal walkabout in Nottingham on Friday. The ¬£495 midi-tote is available in a variety of colours, but Meghan's burgundy, navy and vanilla version sold out within 11 minutes, the brand told ELLE UK.  In a statement, a Strathberry representative said the company was "thrilled" that Prince Harry's fianc√©e picked one of its designs. The brand has confirmed that it will be restocking the sought-after bag in the new year. "We are delighted at the news of Meghan and Prince Harry's engagement and wish them all the best for this exciting period. It was a fantastic surprise to see that Meghan selected one of our core Strathberry styles to carry on her first royal engagement." The independently owned label prides itself on quality craftsmanship. The bags, which start at ¬£225, can take up to 20 hours to make and are stocked in luxury department stores around the world. Just like with the "Kate-effect," people have been desperate to match Meghan, which has already increased sales for a number of other brands. The coat she wore to the engagement photocall sold out at Canadian label Line The Label on Monday, and her nude heels from Aquazzura also sold out on several sites.

 Ming Xi took a tumble, but she kept her smile on the whole time. Even Angels fall sometimes. During the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show today in Shanghai, model Ming Xi took a tumble on the runway.

Xi went on to model the new VS x Balmain collaboration too‚Äîchains, spikes and all.  Since the Victoria's Secret Fashion Shows are usually filmed twice, it's likely Xi's tumble won't make it to the final broadcast. The only thing harder than falling on the runway is getting back up; and Ming Xi did that beautifully.

 "In my wildest dreams I would have never imagined doing 17 Victoria‚Äôs Secret Fashion Shows." Over the weekend, rumors spread that this year's Victoria's Secret Fashion Show in Shanghai would be Alessandra Ambrosio's last one ever. Though reports yesterday appeared to confirm the news, the VS Angel refrained from publicly addressing the news herself on social media‚Äîuntil now. In an emotional Instagram post this morning, the model said goodbye to the VSFS, after walking 17 shows. "Words cannot describe how grateful I am to have been working for this amazing brand that inspires me and women all over the world," Ambrosio, 36, wrote. "In my wildest dreams I would have never imagined doing 17 Victoria‚Äôs Secret Fashion Shows."  She thanked VSFS executive producer Ed Razek and her "Victoria‚Äôs Secret family" for "making these memories unforgettable," but the hardest goodbye was to her fellow Victoria's Secret Angels, who include Adriana Lima (who's walked since 1999), Lily Aldridge, Candice Swanepoel, and more.  "Last night was so emotional to say goodbye to my #angel sisters but we put on the biggest and best show ever," Ambrosio continued. "I could not have done this without all the love and support from my fans. It gives me great pride to be part the Victoria‚Äôs Secret movement! I will always be cheering for you! Love you forever ‚ù§Ô∏è." Read her full post here:  Words cannot describe how grateful I am to have been working for this amazing brand that inspires me and women all over the world. In my wildest dreams I would have never imagined doing 17 Victoria‚Äôs Secret Fashion Shows. Thank you Ed, and all my Victoria‚Äôs Secret family for making these memories unforgettable. Last night was so emotional to say goodbye to my #angel sisters but we put on the biggest and best show ever. I could not have done this without all the love and support from my fans. It gives me great pride to be part the Victoria‚Äôs Secret movement! I will always be cheering for you! Love you forever ‚ù§Ô∏è A post shared by  Alessandra Ambrosio (@alessandraambrosio) on Nov 21, 2017 at 3:20am PST Ambrosio made her Victoria's Secret Fashion Show debut in 2000. Since then, she's become a known staple of the lingerie brand. Her highlights on the runway include wearing the Fantasy Bra twice, walking while pregnant with her second child, and wearing the heaviest wings the event has ever seen, weighing 30 pounds. The model explained to Entertainment Tonight yesterday that she's parting ways with the brand to spend more time on her swimsuit line, Ale by Alessandra, and focus on her acting career. Though she won't be completely be out of the spotlight, we'll still miss seeing her on the catwalk. Take a look at her VSFS evolution below:
 Shop the collab before it sells out.   First there were Balenciaga Crocs, then there were Y/Project Uggs, and now, we've got Valentino Birkenstocks. The luxury fashion house collaborated with the footwear brand on two reimagined pairs of its signature sandals, both of which are available to shop online beginning today.  Valentino creative director Pierpaolo Piccioli put his twist on Birkenstock's classic 'Arizona' sandal with two new unisex styles. The collaboration first debuted on the Valentino runway at Men's Paris Fashion Week last month when models donning tailored suit separates wore the sandals styled with black socks.  The first of two styles, which retail for $495, are a pair of black sandals with the 'VLTN' logo across the side in white.  The second, which retail for a little less at $460, are done in the signature Valentino red color‚Äîsans the oversized logo.   Given fashion's ongoing love affair with the ugly shoe trend, the timing of Valentino's collaboration with Birkenstock is perfect. The classic two-strap sandals have seen a resurgence amongst the fashion set on the street style scene and the 'gram over the past couple seasons.    If the new designer iterations aren't your thing, you can always stick with the classic Birkenstock sandals‚Äîwhich come in colors from white leather to black‚Äîfor spring.  Along with the Birkenstock revival, the Spring 2019 runways also previewed the comeback of Teva sandals. The throwback nylon sandals appeared on the runways of several shows including Tome, Anna Sui, and Collina Strada at New York Fashion Week. This season, it appears both comfort and nostalgia are key.
 Silvia Tcherassi  is not for the wallflowers... Silvia Tcherassi is not new to the fashion game. The Colombian-born designer has been in the industry for over two-decades‚Äîwith bridal, home, ready to wear and accessories collections to her name. She's been honored with France's Chevalier de l‚ÄôOrdre des Arts et des Lettres and her bold designs are favored among the Instagram-set for their use of color, print and unexpected use of shape. In other words,  Silvia Tcherassi is a name you should recognize. Often lauded for her innovative daywear, Tcherassi is going full on evening with a new, feminine 25-piece collection exclusive to Moda Operandi, with an emphasis on beautiful draping, dramatic florals and standout silhouettes, with a few paillettes mixed in for good measure.  "This elevated capsule was created with many different women in mind and is a twist to her typical designs, offering an ultra feminine look," Moda‚Äôs SVP of Merchandising, Mary Chiam, tells BAZAAR.com.  BAZAAR spoke with Tcherassi about her ultimate inspiration and the perfect party spot. Harper's BAZAAR: What was the inspiration for the evening wear collection? Silvia Tcherassi: I was thinking in holiday destinations around the world and different kinds of women: from the ultra-feminine to the more fashion-forward. Each piece was created individually, playing with different fabrics and color palettes. Who do you see as the Silvia Tcherassi Girl? ST: A girl who loves fashion, loves to travel, appreciates little details and values quality over quantity. Women in search of a unique and personal style inspire me. How do the different locales you‚Äôve lived and worked in influence you? ST: In the Caribbean, I learned to value the importance of openness, the tireless pursuit of happiness and the richness of our culture. The sun and the sea are magical. In Miami, a bridge between Latin America, North America and Europe, I feel more multicultural. Today, the city is a cultural and design hub bringing creativity and innovation. I love to work with my providers in Italy because I enjoy the process of creating fabrics, admiring the heritage of these companies and their commitment to technology to keep its legacy running. Is there one woman you‚Äôd love to see in ST? ST: Meghan Markle. I think her wedding gown and last looks have been amazing. Her style represents a modern take in tradition and she values fashion as a communication tool. I hope to see Kaia Gerber wearing one of my designs very soon. She is the face of her generation. How would you describe your personal style? ST: Two words: Casual chic.  Is it reflected in the line? ST: Totally. I believe in an elegance that is not forced or studied, that searches not for perfection but instead to reflect a personality. It's something I call ‚Äúeffortless elegance." The quest for this kind of elegance is the motivation of my creative process. All my projects, fashion, hotels and home collection, follow the same vision. I am an admirer of natural elegance without pretensions. And that differentiates the woman with style from the fashion victims.  Why was Moda Operandi a good partner for this capsule? ST: After the success of my embellished WayuÃÅu mochila bags years ago, we started to talk about doing something special together and I think this is the perfect timing. In addition, Lauren Santo Domingo [founder, Moda Operandi] has a very unique fashion sense and has been very supportive of my endeavors. She was the first to declare the Tcherassi Hotel inCartagena as ‚Äúthe chicest spot for the fashionable flock.‚Äù What is your ultimate evening destination? ST: Of course Cartagena de Indias during Holidays and, especially, New Year‚Äôs Eve.
 Gucci kicks off Milan Fashion Week with a multicultural show.  Alessandro Michele kicked off Milan Fashion Week today with Gucci's Spring 2018 collection. Celebrating a diverse mix of cultures, the show combined Indian, Aztec, and Egyptian influences, styled together as one mash-up, from the set down to the eclectic pieces. See all the highlights from the colorful show below.  1) The culturally-diverse space was based off an ancient map. According to Gucci's Instagram, the runway symbolized the Tiber River (which flows through Rome), while the backdrop was an early medieval structure and map featuring arches in Indian, Egyptian, and Aztec styles. Ancient Roman and Egyptian statues surrounded the show space.    The #GucciSS18 show space recounts diverse inspirations and aesthetics. The setting‚Äôs captions written into the floor resemble a modern translation of an ancient map featuring Roman poet Orazio‚Äôs country home. The runway is Tiber river; while the map is juxtaposed with the layout of the Imperial Fora, dotted with classical statues from different periods and cultures. The backdrop is an early medieval structure with a double portico and the runway features three arches in Indian, Aztec and Egyptian styles. Surfaces in bubbled pvc and streetlights give a metropolitan feel. See the collection live now on Instagram Live. #AlessandroMichele #mfw A post shared by  Gucci (@gucci) on Sep 20, 2017 at 6:29am PDT  Rome wasn‚Äôt built in a day and neither was @gucci‚Äôs breathtaking show venue. Ahead of the house‚Äôs highly anticipated S/S 2018 show today at the @piuarch-designed Gucci Hub, we‚Äôre bringing you an exclusive first look at the set that took three weeks to assemble. Creative director @lallo25 was inspired by an ancient map leading to the country-house of the Roman poet Horace, and transformed the brand's set into a modern map of the location, with modern street lamps, graphics inspired by the Milan metro, and a striking blue catwalk evoking the route of the River Tiber. The set is interspersed with a collection of pillars and statues, and features three grand historical arches, through which Gucci's models will interweave ‚Äì see more of the venue in our Instagram stories. #Gucci #ss18 (üì∑: @jasonlloydevans) A post shared by  Wallpaper* (@wallpapermag) on Sep 20, 2017 at 6:02am PDT Mummies, the Sphinx, Greek gods, broken columns...some of Alessandro Michele's influences @Gucci this season #MFW pic.twitter.com/bu93UueYrq  2) The star-studded front row included A$AP Rocky, Dakota Johnson, Petra Collins and more.   Caught ASAP taking a picture of me. Stalker. A post shared by  Jessica Diehl (@jessicaediehl) on Sep 20, 2017 at 7:07am PDT 3) Making a political statement, the collection was "an act of resistance." According to show notes, "Each garment vibrates with an intellectual tension that resists homologation." "Each garment vibrates with an intellectual tension that resists homologation" - so say the @Gucci show notes #MFW pic.twitter.com/hlY0oOoKpY 4) The fannypack is here to stay. Models carried a variety of Gucci fannypacks down the runway, indicating the revival trend isn't going anywhere just yet.   5) The show included a whopping 108 looks. Much like the runway set, the collection was an eclectic mix of cultures, time periods, and styles. An array of pieces celebrated '70s glitz with glistening sparkles while others took inspiration from the Aztec and Egyptian cultures referenced on the runway.  6) Bugs Bunny and Snow White made unexpected appearances. Menswear pieces enjoyed some throwback nostalgia, embroidered with the classic animated characters.  7) Continuing to play off of knockoffs and counterfeit goods, "Guccy" bags were sent down the runway. Alessandro Michele continues to get cheeky with his accessories‚Äîand his penchant for logomania is still going strong.

  The jeweler's first luxury holiday catalogue also includes a 3-Oven Cast Iron Range and a motorcycle. For this year's holidays, come and trim your Christmas tree with decorations bought at Tiffany. Ahead of December, the luxury jewelry retailer has announced its first ever holiday catalogue, which will feature 12 one-of-a-kind items by Tiffany & Co., from a ritzy spin on your classic advent calendar to a custom-made motorcycle. ‚ÄúThis holiday we wanted to really surprise our customers in a whole new way by showcasing the most awe-inspiring objects and experiences that you can only find at Tiffany,‚Äù said Reed Krakoff, the chief artistic officer of Tiffany & Co. ‚ÄúIn addition to many exciting new designs and collections, this year we‚Äôve curated 12 gifts that represent the best of the best and embody the artistry and craftsmanship at the heart of our brand.‚Äù Among the 12 gifts, expect to find a four-foot-tall advent calendar, rendered as an illustrative take of the jeweler's Fifth Avenue flagship store.

 From Pharrell's runway appearance to the Chanel Diner.  Last night, Karl Lagerfeld unveiled Chanel's latest Metiers d'Art show in New York, marking its first show in the city in over a decade. Much like all the fashion house's runway extravaganzas, there was a big theme at play, a star-studded front row, and a new crop of accessories to get us talking. But this show also included a few surprises, like Pharrell walking the runway (in gold pants, nonetheless), and the Chanel Diner we never knew we needed. Catch up on all 6 things you need to know from the night below.  In the past, Chanel's jet-setting Metiers d'Art show has been presented in Hamburg, Rome, and of course, Paris, but Lagerfeld opted to unveil the latest at the Upper East Side museum.  If you thought the show's location meant a New York-inspired collection was coming, think again. Instead, the runway unfolded in The Temple of Dendur area of the Met's Egyptian wing‚Äîwhere its backdrop served as the real inspiration to all 85 looks of the show. And Lagerfeld really took the theme to heart.  The collection, which was practically dripping in gold, featured a lineup of Egyptian-inspired accessories like pyramid-shaped bags, collar necklaces, and gold boots galore. While there was still a bout of Chanel signatures like tweeds and suiting, they were styled with gold opaque tights and matching gold boots.  The musician first made his runway debut two years ago at Chanel's 2016 Metiers d'Art show. A frequent muse and collaborator to the brand, he returned to the runway last night wearing an all gold look.  Chanel always delivers a celebrity-filled front row, but last night's was especially star-studded. Julianne Moore, Penelope Cruz, Lily Rose Depp, Janelle Monae, Diane Kruger, Margot Robbie, Marion Cotillard, Rowan Blanchard, and Christy Turlington Burns were all in attendance for the brand's New York show.    Little Hudson is growing up quickly and walked the show in a gold Pharaoh-inspired look.   Would you like fries with that? Duh @chanelofficial üçüüçîüçüüçî #Chanelinnyc #Chanel A post shared by  Joanna Hillman (@joannahillman) on Dec 4, 2018 at 6:49pm PST The diner of our dreams came to life after the show, serving up burgers, fries, and spiked Shirley Temples Chanel style. The all-American meal was then followed up with ice cream sundaes and milkshakes. Who can we talk to about making this a permanent restaurant?
 The tennis icon's new fashion brand, Serena, launches today.  Since the start of her career, Serena Williams has used her strength to empower women across the globe. Now, the tennis icon is looking to do so through a new medium: a fashion line of her own.  Just one day after winning her first Grand Slam match since giving birth to daughter Olympia, Williams is debuting her first eponymous fashion brand, Serena. With affordable prices ranging from $35 - $250, the first drop of the collection, a 12-piece capsule, officially launches today.    Serena bralette, $45, briefs, $40, and metallic parka, $215, serenawilliams.com. SHOP NOW  "My inspiration was strength‚Äîbringing femininity and strength to the modern woman. My goal is for women to feel confident and sexy when they‚Äôre wearing it. It‚Äôs practical and wearable, yet it makes you feel good and walk taller‚Äîeveryone should have that feeling," Williams told BAZAAR.com.  But the collection goes beyond tennis-approved athleisure and into unexpected territory with pieces like vintage-inspired structured denim and sexy slip dresses. Additional drops of the debut Serena collection will be released throughout summer and fall‚Äîwith a total of 75 new styles to come.  Serena sweatshirt, $60, and joggers, $70, serenawilliams.com. SHOP NOW While Williams says strength and positive affirmations were key in inspiring the pieces from her new collection, another special someone also served as a major source of inspiration for the athlete/designer: her 9-month-old daughter, Olympia.  "Ever since [giving birth to] Olympia I was like, ‚ÄòOkay I have a daughter, I want her to feel good about herself.‚Äô She is strong already, so I want her to feel beautiful and I want to spread that message through the collection," Williams said.  While speaking with BAZAAR.com, she also hinted that we can expect some Serena pieces from little Olympia in the future, ‚ÄúOlympia is coming out with a piece or two in the collection," she teased excitedly. Serena welcomed her first child, a baby girl named Alexis Olympia Ohanian, Jr., with husband Alexis Ohanian Sr. back in September.   Serena denim chain dress, $205, serenawilliams.com. SHOP NOW What's most surprising from the Serena collection, however, is the capsule of structured denim pieces‚Äîwhich includes an overall dress with chain straps, high-waisted jeans, and a denim mini skirt.  "I got tired of seeing all this 90% stretch denim so I wanted to go back to structured denim, like what the original jeans were like." Williams explained.   Serena varsity dress, $195, serenawilliams.com. SHOP NOW As for the rest of the 75-piece collection, that will be released in drops spread out over the next two seasons. This morning, Williams took to Instagram to announce the first 12 pieces from the launch of her e-commerce site‚Äîand to share the backstory of her love of fashion.   They say life is about timing. I learned this lesson at age 18, when I chose to play a light tennis schedule because I wanted to go to fashion school. Some criticized my decision, but I knew I had two loves--tennis and fashion--and had to find a way to make them coexist. After 15 years of false starts, and people in fashion telling me "no," it only only drove me to work harder. As a result, I discovered what it meant to invest in myself, and I allowed that belief in myself to drive me to reach my dream.  Today, I am proud to launch @serena , my own online shop. Never stop believing in yourself, you're worth it. #BeSeenBeHeard A post shared by  Serena Williams (@serenawilliams) on May 30, 2018 at 6:00am PDT "They say life is about timing.

 The product manager  at Rowing Blazers talks menswear, dressing for your body type, and Princess Diana.  I met with Keziah Beall at the Rowing Blazers Clubhouse in SoHo. Like Jack Carlson, the founder of Rowing Blazers, Keziah was also a competitive rower, which adds a sense of authenticity to the brand that can‚Äôt be argued. Keziah and I chatted about how women can implement menswear into their wardrobes, how her career as a rower influenced her style, and, of course, Rowing Blazers. K‚Äãeziah Beall ‚ÄãI have worn a lot of hats for R‚Äãowing Blazers‚Äã! I have done different things every day from overseeing fulfillment and customer service to more creative projects. I‚Äôm currently doing a project for a women‚Äôs swimwear brand, ‚ÄãAndie,‚Äã that is customer experience based.  I‚Äã grew up just outside of Seattle and was there through high school. After that, I went to school in Virginia and bounced around on the East Coast for a little bit. Three years ago, I came to New York to launch Rowing Blazers. ‚ÄãI think so! It‚Äôs not a particularly stylish city, but I learned that my outfit always has to have a certain level of practicality. I have to dress for the weather. I can‚Äôt wear something just because I love it and disregard the fact that it‚Äôs really hot or cold in New York. In that sense, there is always this sensibility to it. I love just being casual. It kind of blew my mind when I went to school in Virginia, and boys were just wearing chinos that their moms didn‚Äôt make them put on! It‚Äôs been fun for me to push my comfort zone, which is from the very casual side,  and learn to be more dressy. I have that kind of preppy and classic look.  I think in Virginia, because it is very homogenous, I sort of pushed against it. However, I also learned to appreciate it. So, maybe now, yes, but at the time, no! So much Lilly Pulitzer. In school and college, there was a very specific athlete look. I think oftentimes professors treated athletes differently. I always wanted to sort of go against that and not lean into wearing all the free gear and fitting into that stereotype. So, in that sense, yes. Obviously now, learning about the history of the blazer and how it comes from the sport of rowing has renewed  for me. It‚Äôs been through the lens of menswear specifically, which is interesting. I wouldn‚Äôt say that my time as a rower got me here beyond that‚Äôs how I met Jack, and through Jack, I learned all of this. It was two degrees of separation.  No! I knew it was a thing‚Äîthat if you went to Henley, your team would get blazers. And it always seemed really cool. It wasn‚Äôt really a tradition at UVA going for the women, the men‚Äôs team did. It was very peripheral at first.  Yeah, I think so. I do love wearing leggings and T-shirts to go around on casual days. I think the way I dress now is very much a celebration of being able to shop for my body type, which wasn‚Äôt ever something I could do in high school. Online shopping was still very new, and there weren‚Äôt a lot of tall pants that were cool. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve leaned into the athlete thing so much now that I‚Äôm not doing it. I enjoy being able to dress like a normal person now if that makes sense.   It was hard as a high schooler! When I was in high school, it wasn‚Äôt cool to have cutoffs or culottes. You wanted to have pants that were dragging on the ground, and I could not find that! I wish I could travel back in time and give myself a little more confidence to buy vintage men‚Äôs Levi‚Äôs and rock it, but it‚Äôs high school. I got there eventually!  The sweater Jack actually got for me. He knows I‚Äôm obsessed with Princess Diana, as everyone is right now. He tries to borrow it from time to time. It‚Äôs cute that our interests cross and that he got it for me. The skirt I got at a secondhand shop in Charlottesville years ago. It‚Äôs technically a size too small, but I love it and it feels so one of a kind. I don‚Äôt make many impulse purchases, hardly ever. I often see things on Instagram that I covet, file it away, and think about it later. But this ring was at a vintage store in England when we were at Henley Royal Regatta. It just felt like if I didn‚Äôt buy it right then and there, I wouldn‚Äôt get that chance again. I don‚Äôt know how old it is, but I want to do some research on it. It was a great price and in this little curio cabinet. Exactly, it reminds me of that trip! It feels like it has history behind it.  I‚Äã think it‚Äôs exploring with what works for my body type, as someone who is very tall, and sort of making sure trends work for me. It‚Äôs also being really honest about what doesn‚Äôt work. I feel very inspired by Scandinavian street style right now. There is such a big emphasis on repurposing old trends and being kind of funky and colorful, but not so ‚Äúfashion.‚Äù Just enjoying wearing clothes.  ‚ÄãHigh-waisted jeans and pants are something I realized I should have been wearing a long time ago. That‚Äôs been a cool thing about being in the menswear world: I‚Äôve taken a lot of Rowing Blazers pants, a‚Äãnd taken in the waist a little. I love that more relaxed fit and leaning into the more masculine side of things. I was so sensitive about that when I was younger because I was so tall, I didn‚Äôt want to wear oversized things. Now, I feel much more comfortable doing that.  ‚ÄãI got some early samples of the women‚Äôs blazers, most of which didn‚Äôt make it into the line. I also got some damaged products from our first pop-up.  ‚ÄãI love both the r‚Äãugbys‚Äã and blazers as ‚Äúmenswear for women.‚Äù I think the ‚Äãbaseball hats a‚Äãre also fun. It‚Äôs such a strong statement brand, and it‚Äôs very individual. You can‚Äôt go wrong with a nice blazer. It strikes a nice balance between feeling vintage and tailored, but not too much of each.   I have the pants! I‚Äôll probably get the blazer as well. ‚ÄãI was a high schooler in the early 2000s, and I don‚Äôt think the movies of that time had particularly good style. So I love The Breakfast Club. This is kind of cheesy, Erin Brockovich had a big influence on me. In terms of don‚Äôt judge people by their cover and wear what makes you feel good! Watching at an age when I didn‚Äôt love my clothes was emotional.  ‚ÄãYeah! I think especially with a lot of the trends going on right now, she was the OG. I love FrancÃßoise Hardy. I would love to have bangs like her, but can‚Äôt commit.  Younger Keziah would have loved to be in Pirates of the Caribbean or Pride and Prejudice, definitely a period piece. I love Downton Abbey for that same reason. That kind of elegance, even in the maids‚Äô costumes, is so well done. It‚Äôs hard to pick an actual period. When Stranger Things first came out, a friend who is also my age, said it made us both nostalgic for a time we didn‚Äôt live through. The styling is just so good! ‚ÄúMenswear‚Äù by The 1975 ‚ÄúInfinite High‚Äù by Panama Wedding ‚ÄúSuperstition‚Äù by Stevie Wonder ‚ÄúBeta Love‚Äù by Ra Ra Riot ‚ÄúSend Me on My Way‚Äù by Rusted Root
 And just like in 2000, she looked  üî•üî•üî• Jennifer Lopez delivered a major surprise to guests at Milan Fashion Week tonight when she closed the runway at Versace's Spring 2020 show‚Äîwearing a replica of that iconic Grammys dress, nonetheless.  Instead of a traditional finale model walk, Versace tapped J.Lo to end its show with a bang this season. Making her official runway debut, the 50-year-old actress and singer walked the show wearing an updated version of her famous plunging palm print dress from the 2000 Grammy Awards. And surprising to no one, she completely slayed.   @jlo recreates her most iconic red carpet moment in @versace that launched Google image in 2000. ‚Äî@nicolefritton A post shared by  Harper's BAZAAR (@harpersbazaarus) on Sep 20, 2019 at 11:54am PDT As the show ended, a voiceover recording asking Google to show pictures of that green Versace dress filled the room. After images filled screens around the venue, Versace‚Äôs voice then asked to see the real thing‚Äìwhich then led to J.Lo storming the runway and the fastest standing ovation to ever occur at a fashion show.  Aside from being an epic moment, there was some significance behind Lopez walking the runway. This season marks 20 years since the plunging green palm print first dress first appeared on Versace's runway, ahead of the singer wearing it to the music award ceremony. That red carpet moment was so immense and so searched for that it led to the invention of Google Images (yes, J.Lo really did that). So to make things full circle for Spring 2020, the Italian fashion house paid homage to both the singer and Google.   Join us on Friday, September 20th at 8PM CEST for the Women‚Äôs Spring-Summer 2020 show: streamed live from Milan on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and on Versace.com. #MFW #VersaceSS20 A post shared by  Versace (@versace) on Sep 18, 2019 at 1:23pm PDT The show ended with both Lopez and Donatella Versace walking side by side down the runway. Another legendary moment in the books for the dress. 
 Kaia Gerber and Adut Akech closed the stunning runway show. Valentino has long mastered the art of breathtaking runway moments and today's Pre-Fall 2019 show in Tokyo, Japan was no exception. For the fashion house's first show in Tokyo, creative director Pierpaolo Piccioli delivered a stunning runway full of red tulle gowns and designs celebrating Japanese culture. The show both started and ended with a lineup of all red looks ranging from romanticized tulle to suiting and floral silk dye prints. Kaia Gerber and Adut Akech closed the runway in coordinating ruffle tulle gowns.  As if the parade of looks done in the fashion house's signature hue wasn't stunning enough, the finale saw a storm of red rose petals falling from the ceiling as models walked the runway in color coordinating looks.   An exploration of balance and contrasts, @maisonvalentino‚Äôs Pre-fall 2019 show in Tokyo saw the brand‚Äôs first co-ed presentation being held at the raw, industrial space of Terrada Warehouse. Swipe left for a greeting from the dashing #SongJoongKi right before the show. #ÏÜ°Ï§ëÍ∏∞ A post shared by  Harper's BAZAAR Singapore (@harpersbazaarsg) on Nov 27, 2018 at 9:31am PST Models lined up along the runway as petals fell from above while a pianist and string band played in the background‚Äîmaking for a beautiful moment.    #valentino rocks in #tokyo with a super collection created by #pierpaolopiccioli inspired by the history of the fashion house with touches of #japanese culture #valentinotky #valentinoprefall19 A post shared by  GPBlackstage (@giampietrobaudo) on Nov 27, 2018 at 10:06am PST  But the Pre-Fall '19 collection delved deeper than just pretty gowns. Piccioli looked to the culture of Japan to inspire the 90-look show. Namely, the creative director was inspired by wabi-sabi‚Äîa Japanese aesthetic centered on the acceptance of transience and imperfection. The concept was translated into asymmetrical silhouettes, ruffles, and reimagined Valentino floral prints crushed into red and black silk dye.  "The iconography of the Maison‚Äîthe ruffles, the lace, the grace, and then the flowers, the colors, the motifs‚Äîis interpreted in a wabi sabi key," the brand wrote on Instagram alongside a photo of Adut Akech on the runway.   {The iconography of the Maison - the ruffles, the lace, the grace, and then the flowers, the colors, the motifs - is interpreted in a wabi sabi key.} @AdutAkech in #ValentinoPreFall19 by @pppiccioli. #ValentinoTKY ‚Äì Tokyo A post shared by  Valentino (@maisonvalentino) on Nov 27, 2018 at 11:11am PST The end result was a collection that remained true to Valentino's aesthetic while paying homage to Japanese culture‚Äîsomething other fashion brands could learn from when staging their runways in other countries. 
 Take notes. One glance at Brianna Lance‚Äîa statuesque redhead with a sunny smile‚Äîand you automatically want to be friends with her. As a DJ, painter, musician, fashion consultant, and downtown cool girl, she‚Äôs a multi-hyphenate across many industries.  You‚Äôre just as likely to find her dancing the night away at a party (decked in a floral dress and sneakers), as you are at a gallery on a Saturday morning, with her new dog Larry at her side. A true modern-day Renaissance woman, the former head designer at Reformation prefers berets to ski hats and combat boots to heels, and will never say no to a slip dress. Take a peek at a day in her life through her favorite looks. Her Go-To Topper: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm obsessed with this coat because I love oversized men‚Äôs silhouettes. You can throw it over anything and it‚Äôll look good.‚Äù  Step and Repeat: ‚ÄúI mostly wear men‚Äôs shoes and really unsexy shoes because I like to be comfortable. Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre wearing a slip dress and you wear it with a fussy shoe, you‚Äôre automatically going to look like a fussy person. I want to look free. Also, you should be able to walk for a long time in whatever shoes that you‚Äôre wearing.‚Äù Stella McCartney coat, turtleneck, and trousers; The Row boots; Akris Aim√©e bag, $3,590, akris.ch   Her Go-To Garment: ‚ÄúIt could be because I‚Äôm from Texas and grew up going to barns, but I think overalls are amazing. I have a tendency to wear clothes that a lot of little boys would wear.‚Äù  Hat's Off: ‚ÄúAll winter I wear berets. Out of all hats, I think they make your face look the nicest. If you put on a ski cap, you can look cool...but you can also look like a dork. A beret is so cute and feminine.‚Äù Christian Dior overalls and beret; Akris turtleneck; Akris Aim√©e bag, $2,390, akris.ch Her Go-To Bag: ‚ÄúI don't have one! I like to switch them out. I have all shades of bags so  you can just match them to whatever I'm wearing." Quick-Change Artist: "Sometimes I‚Äôll literally turn over a bag completely on top of another bag, let the contents fall into the second bag, and just go, ‚ÄòDone.

But I don‚Äôt love my legs, so I go for long dresses. Everyone has their thing.‚Äù  Gut Check: ‚ÄúThe best lesson I learned at Reformation was to not pay attention to people‚Äôs weird rules. Whatever industry you‚Äôre in, people have these set ideas about how you‚Äôre supposed to do things. But it's really interesting to just to do things more on instinct.‚Äù  Herm√®s dress; Akris Aim√©e bag, akris.ch   Her Nighttime Bag: ‚ÄúI have a lot of different silhouettes that I like, it just depends on the outfit. I love exotic skins!‚Äù   Akris Aim√©e bag, akris.ch   Her Go-To Trend: ‚ÄúI love matching sets. This printed velvet one is like wearing pajamas, but fancier.‚Äù Cozy Comfort: "I wear a lot of giant coats like this because I‚Äôm always freezing! And I love a silk pajama set with a big coat on top. A lot of times I just wear a sweat suit and a fur coat ‚Äì that‚Äôs my uniform in the fall."

 Either way her Heathrow look is fire... Priyanka Chopra might as well be a royal in her own right, she's so embedded in the "fam." The actress nearly stole the show at Meghan Markle's wedding to Prince Harry in May, when she donned both a major lavender suit with matching fascinator by Vivienne Westwood and a show-stopping, shimmering, fitted gold gown by Dior. The actress is a close friend of the couple. It's possible no one learned their lesson and invited this stunner to yet another royal wedding, as she was just spotted at Heathrow airport the day before Princess Eugenie is slated to wed Jack Brooksbank in London. The Quantico star skipped a tracksuit or yoga pants or a hoodie for the cross-Atlantic trip, and instead donned a Saville Row-worthy plaid blazer, khaki trousers, a green turtleneck, and white heeled booties for her flight. Ever the star, she finished her look with black cat eye sunnies. There is currently no evidence that her fiance, Nick Jonas, will be in attendance for the nuptials as her plus one.     There's also no word yet on whether someone from the palace was sent to "co-opt" her luggage so that she might have to wear something less fabulous than planned to tomorrow's royal affair. But we wouldn't blame a bride for trying. In the meantime, shop her standout airport look. 
 Your family portraits could never.  Posing for family portraits as a teenager is always a drag, but when you and your siblings are the supermodel spawn of Cindy Crawford, it's a tad less embarrassing.  Taking sibling portraits to the next level, Kaia and Presley Gerber front the Spring 2018 campaign for Calvin Klein Jeans together. The teenage modeling duo appears in the brand's latest #MyCalvins ads titled 'Our Youth' and photographed by Willy Vanderperre.  In the photos, Kaia and Presley wear head-to-toe denim and pose with a red and white Americana-inspired quilt while sitting in a rustic barn (as you do). The all-American ads are the latest from the brand's "Our Family. #MyCalvins." campaign‚Äîwhich has also starred the likes of Solange and the A$AP mob this season.  The ongoing campaign's concept is to celebrate unity amongst individuals‚Äîwith the bond of family at its core. And what better way to celebrate familial bonds than with supermodel siblings carrying on the genetic legacy of Cindy Crawford?    This marks the first Calvin Klein campaign for 16-year-old Kaia, who made her runway debut for the brand at New York Fashion Week last fall. She then went on to dominate the runways in London, Milan and Paris throughout the Spring 2018 season‚Äîproving to be the rising supermodel to watch. 18-year-old Presley, meanwhile, previously appeared in the brand's #MyCalvins campaign in Fall 2016.  Interestingly enough, the duo's supermodel mom has yet to appear in a #MyCalvins campaign, perhaps it's time to make it a full-on family affair next season?

 Rosie Huntingon-Whiteley stepped out in a pair and we're obsessed.  Thanks to their early 2000s takeover, some many of us still associate Ugg boots with velour sweatsuits and paparazzi pictures of Paris Hilton. And while a number of women (and men) still love their classic Uggs, the South Californian brand has quietly been giving itself a more fashion-forward revamp for the past few seasons‚Äîand their newest boots prove it's working.  Meet the new wave of Ugg boots: the Kasen, which come in chestnut and black colorways as well as short and tall styles. The anything-but-basic shearling boot features a short stacked heel for the perfect amount of height. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, an ambassador for the brand, was one of the first to debut the new boots while out and about. The model wore the chestnut Kasen boots with a pair of blue jeans and a plush camel coat. Part of the brand's Fall 2017 collection, the brand's new Kasen style ranges from $150 for the short boots to $250 for the tall pair.  Ugg boots, $250, SHOP For nearly the past decade, Ugg boots may have been reserved for walking your dog or chic apr√®s ski looks, but the brand's new styles prove that we may finally be ready to shed the boots' association with the early aughts and enter the next era of Uggs.

 Laura Taylor is her own best model... It's not enough to be a staunch minimalist in 2018's highly photographable, Insta-bait age of fashion. Laura Taylor and Ryan Holliday-Stevens aren't minimal purists, but they like a sleek line, sculptural elements, a slick cut, solid black and white with an occasional intense wash of color. The creative duo launched Solace London in 2013 to serve as a brand where "modern futurism balanced with timeless minimalism"‚Äîconsider it simplicity with a twist, a quirk, a dose of character. Taylor just happens to serve as the ideal model for her brand‚Äîtall and elegant with an innate sense of cool.  BAZAAR.com asked Taylor to style her go-to piece, the item she just can't seem to stop wearing for three difference occasions. The Brit designer's wardrobe MVP is a pair of simple black pants. "These trousers are a staple in our collection.  Over previous seasons we have created various iterations of them by changing the length, fabrication, and print," the designer explains. "They are versatile, they travel well (you can just throw them in your suitcase and don‚Äôt need to worry about creasing them!) and they‚Äôre flattering."  Laura Taylor: Solace London is the meeting point between mine and Ryan‚Äôs (my best friend and business partner) personal taste and style. I‚Äôm quite refined and pared back‚ÄîRyan is more experimental. He really pushes my boundaries through the things he introduces me to. We describe Solace London as modern futurism balanced with timeless minimalism. I‚Äôd say the same could be said for my style. Why did you want to launch your own brand? LT: When we launched Solace London we were ready for the next phase of our careers. We‚Äôd been working for other brands for over a decade but wanted to start something that reflected our personal taste that we could develop and grow with no boundaries.  What have been the most challenging aspects of launching and running Solace London? LT: The different hats you have to wear (metaphorically speaking!). You have to be adaptable, dynamic, and a problem solver. A day in the office rarely goes as planned.    What is your definition of success for Solace London?   LT: How you measure success is personal and changes over time as your plans develop and get bigger. We‚Äôre now five years in and work with the world's leading stores and have a wonderfully loyal customer base through our own e-commerce channel. When a customer takes the time to write an email telling us how much she loves her piece of Solace London and how incredible she felt wearing it, that‚Äôs success. It means I‚Äôm doing my job well.    If you were to give one piece of advice for someone launching a fashion brand what would it be? LT: Do it with someone you trust. Having someone to bounce ideas off is essential. Plus you have someone to celebrate the highs with, as well as get through the lows.    If you weren‚Äôt a designer what would you do?   LT: If I didn‚Äôt do this I‚Äôd want to be a detective in the police force.

 "Posing for my husband like..." Emily Ratajkowski may currently be in California, as she was just spotted yesterday on the sunny streets of LA wearing a floral spring look. But today, the model took to Instagram to tell a different story, posting a few throwback vacation photos wearing a little less clothing. Make that, no clothing at all. If you're one of emrata's 16.8 million followers, you may have already double-tapped the vertical overhead (possibly drone-captured) shot of the brunette model basking on a daybed in the sun, straw fedora over her face, skillfully contorted to get around Instagram's nudity clauses.  "Take me back," the 26-year-old newlywed captioned her post.  Take me back A post shared by  Emily Ratajkowski (@emrata) on Mar 21, 2018 at 10:24am PDT And the next-to-naked vacation photoshoot didn't stop there.  Ratajkowski shared another stunning nude photo, posing in nothing but a sun hat and gold hoops. Facing a giant granite wall, arm over breasts, and balancing on her tip-toes, the model showed off her crazy-long legs and fully bare backside to whoever stood on the flip side of the camera.  From her caption, we're guessing that EmRata was putting on a show for her now-husband, Sebastian Bear-McClard. "Posing for my husband like," she wrote next to the skin-baring shot.  Posing for my husband like A post shared by  Emily Ratajkowski (@emrata) on Mar 21, 2018 at 12:02pm PDT We're thinking that the throwback series may have been taken on a recent honeymoon getaway. As the low-key couple managed to pull off a sneaky private City Hall marriage ceremony last month, which was only publicized to Ratajkowski's Instagram followers after the fact. The duo's nuptials were both inconspicuous and unexpected, as the couple never publicly confirmed they were dating before tying the knot, and were first photographed together in public this past Valentine's Day‚Äîonly a week before their wedding.  üíçnyüíç A post shared by  Emily Ratajkowski (@emrata) on Feb 23, 2018 at 1:32pm PST The honeymooners seem happy, in love, and definitely tanned...all over.
 All about the bride-to-be's "modern" style, her chic white engagement coat, and how to buy it‚Äîfrom the Canadian designer who's worked with her for years. When Meghan Markle stepped out for her engagement photo call with Prince Harry at Kensington Palace on Monday, royal fans went into a tizzy over her stunning winter-white coat from her one of her go-to labels, Canadian brand LINE. An explosion of orders for the $627 ($799 CAD) belted wool wrap coat, now known as the "Meghan," soon caused the brand's website to crash. Internet users dubbed the actress's immediate viral fashion-influence "The Markle effect."  John Muscat, the Toronto-based designer behind the highly sought-after coat, says he's been dressing Markle for four years. She owns a dozen of his pieces, and even sported his Margaux trench coat at the Closing Ceremony of Prince Harry's Invictus Games in September. The 45-year-old LINE president and co-founder chats with BAZAAR.com about his loyal client's effortlessly modern engagement style, her commitment to Canadian clothing, and how you can snag one of those coveted white coats.  "Meghan has a casual, sophisticated look and is always put together, always looking great. She likes to feel modern and dressed up, but still chic‚Äîand she's always interested in wearing a tailored silhouette or a wrap coat, which we saw at the photo call. She likes to have the right lines on her clothing, she's really got a great eye, and knows what looks good on her. What I also love about Meghan is that she has a relaxed style and has always stayed true to that. I think we'll see that in future fashion choices, too." "She looked very her, which is really what was great about the coat. It's funny, I actually didn't know she'd be wearing the coat and it was such a delightful surprise to see her in it. It's so her style and she looked so natural and confident in that white color, which was just beautiful. She looked like an absolute dream."   "It gets reinterpreted into different color waves for new collections. The winter white color is from our fall collection and is made of wool with a flattering tie at the waist. It also comes in soft blush, burgundy, and black." "When we saw the photos of what she wore to the photo call, we were so touched that she thought to bring a little bit of Canada with her to London. I really appreciated that and I think that speaks to her as a person and her commitment to her past." "I've been a fan of her style ever since she started filming Suits in Toronto. We generally work with her managers and public relations team, who organize what Meghan wants to wear. It's very much an organic relationship with her. If I see things that I think would be good for her or look good on her, then I send them to her. I know her style very well, so I pick things out and when her people have their own requests, we try to put together things that will work. We have a great relationship with her and her team. It's such a great fit for the both of us‚Äîour look and what she wants to wear seem to organically align. Our style is chic and sophisticated, while still being casual and that mirrors her, exactly. Now, she owns at least a dozen pieces from LINE." "We were so touched that she thought to bring a little bit of Canada with her to London." "Meghan's friend Jessica had a lot to do with our relationship with Meghan, because she's been a supporter of the brand for years. She helped Meghan go from being a fan of the brand to wearing it more often." "Ours have all sold out and new coats are headed into a re-cut, but we're doing our best to accommodate all of the requests.  The winter white is scheduled to repeat into our fall 2018 collection, so we'll do a cut before then. Luckily, we're on a 12-month a year program, so it'll be around!" In the meantime, LINE is accepting pre-orders at line@nkpr.net.
 Little House on the Prairie meets NYC streets. Chose your fighter: Amazon's Personal Shopper by Prime Wardrobe service or The Drop, a collection curated by your favorite influencers? Well, it may just have to be both because today, August 6, Amazon is releasing its newest collection for The Drop curated by The Fashion Guitar blogger herself, Charlotte Groeneveld. Groeneveld, known for her effortless style that typically consists of simple, comfortable pieces paired with statement accessories or shoes, put together a 14-piece collection that includes styles that were seemingly inspired by this year's prairie/victorian trend, including a mint green puff-sleeve floor-length gown Groeneveld calls the "hero" of her collection and a white, high-neck bib mini dress that features a ruffle hem.  It's not all romantic dresses and blouses, though. Groeneveld's collection also features bubble gum pink cycling shorts, loose chambray shorts, pink wide-leg trousers, and more.  ‚ÄúThe collection is an extension of my own wardrobe, but filling the gaps with pieces I felt were still missing,‚Äù Charlotte told People. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs inspired by today‚Äôs street style rather than runway collections. It brings together everything I love seeing on women around me.‚Äù The entire collection is live now, but only for 30 hours. Shop the full range at amazon.com/TheDrop, download the Amazon App on your mobile, or shop some of our favorite pieces.

 Snacks but make it fashun.  Summer is right around the corner and while you may have already shopped some new sandals and beach bags, you're not fully ready until you've seen Bella Hadid and Alexander Wang fiercely posing with some Magnum bars.  The model and designer are the newest faces of the ice cream brand's "Take Pleasure Seriously" campaign, which is incredibly effective because now all I want to accessorize with this season is a Magnum bar.  
 In the video, Hadid and Wang snack on some Magnum bars while on the set of a fashion shoot, as all fashion people of course do. On set, the model pulls out a secret stash of ice cream from her black leather Alexander Wang cooler. It's unclear whether Wang will actually be selling a leather cooler, but if so, be prepared to picnic and make it fashion this summer.  If you thought eating an ice cream bar couldn't possibly be sexy, allow the great Bella Hadid to prove you wrong:    I mean, can we take a moment to fully appreciate this portrait of a girl and her ice cream bar? This is how you do a proper engagement photo shoot, people.    These images and video are just the first of Alexander Wang's collaboration with Magnum. The brands will be making a surprise announcement during Cannes Film Festival next week, which hopefully involves Bella eating ice cream on the red carpet. Fingers crossed. 
 Fashion meets art meets music. Swiss luxury brand Bally just launched a limited edition capsule collection in collaboration with street artist Shok-1 and Grammy Award winner Swizz Beatz. The edgy street style collection features sweatshirts, joggers, totes, fanny packs, sneakers, and hats for both men and women featuring Shok-1's iconic street art X-Rays. Shok-1 chose three of his staple symbols for this collaboration‚ÄîX-Ray paintings of a hand gesture, a fly, and "The Consumer"‚Äîall in black, white, and flesh. British artist Shok-1 ‚Äî who calls himself the "pioneer of aerosol X-ray" ‚Äî is known for his spray painting technique, and for using walls all around the world as his canvas. His work has been featured in KITH's SoHo store as well as The Bushwick Collection in Brooklyn.   ‚ÄòStolen Heart‚Äô ‚Äî-> Swipe for more images... üëäüèª @trumanbrewery A post shared by  SHOK-1 (@shok_1) on May 5, 2018 at 11:26am PDT The brand launched the collection with a party in Shibuya, Tokyo where Shok-1 debuted his first ever large scale mural in Japan. The party featured performances by Nas and Swizz Beatz himself. ‚ÄúOur focus for this capsule was exploring the art of X Ray, and Shok-1 is a master artist and a legend at his craft," Swizz Beatz tells BAZAAR.com. "Bally is an iconic brand that represented the music culture very early, and the quality, in my opinion, has always been number one."

From playful polka dots to pretty pink florals to classic leopard, a matchy-matchy look is perfect for everything from weekend getaways to outdoor brunches and destination weddings.

 Explore the 6,900 square feet of dreamy, minimal luxe retail space. Today (Mar. 15) marks the debut of The Conservatory, a new boutique at Hudson Yards that hopes to bring the most appealing  aspects about online shopping into a thoughtfully curated immersive shopping experience IRL. Brian Bolke, a co-founder of Forty Five Ten, who parted ways with the company in 2017, dreamed up this new and well-curated space that considers the origin, sustainability, and price of an item before carrying it in store. There is also an emphasis on offering pieces for all age ranges, sizes, that "defy traditional gender-specific presentations."Each season, the store will offer interesting visuals in-store, in print, and digitally to "reflect the season‚Äôs Curriculum theme" and touch on the consumer's five basic senses. There is also 500 square feet of dedicated space for a gallery to spotlight original artwork that's on theme for the season. The store will sell a fun mix of 50 emerging and heritage brands from Tibi to Jil Sander. For the grand opening, the store will carry a unique capsule by Narciso Rodriguez.The retail space also includes Teak Tearoom. Executive Chef Adam Ross will oversee the food which includes baked goods from Thomas Keller‚Äôs Bouchon Bakery, and teas by Waris. The warm spot features  Knoll furniture and tableware by Georg Jensen that is available for purchase, naturally.  Other epicurean and culinary gifts, including autographed books from Chef Thomas Keller‚Äôs Finesse The Store, is available for sale for the first time outside his Napa Valley shop. Take a tour below.  The lifestyle concept store boasts a flower shop called Lewis Miller by Urban Stems at its entryway. There will be a mix of blooms including orchids that are available exclusively to the store and can be picked up in-person or delivered. Bolke has tapped a team of editors to help merchandise the store and assist with creating original content and in-store programming. Town & Country fashion and accessories director Will Kahn will support the fine jewelry selection. Former Harper's BAZAAR and Town & Country Beauty Director Jamie Rosen will oversee well-being. Manhattan designer Justin von der Fehr will manage living. Cindy Weber-Cleary, former Fashion Director at InStyle and Glamour, will be the boutique's wardrobe editor. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a place of study and discovery, a place that brings nature indoors and place that suggests the idea of conservation‚Äîof respect for resources and time. Time is the ultimate luxury. I invite you to literally stop and smell the roses,‚Äù says Bolke. La Sieste Bastide, is a quiet, ten-minute private room to take in the colorful space that's filled with relaxing sounds, scenery, architectural forms, and scents all inspired by the French city of Aix-en-Provence. Bastide co-founders, Fr√©d√©ric Fekkai and Shirin von Wulffen, commissioned French artist Alexandre Benjamin Navet to create the lifestyle room to help you recharge.
 Deciphering the party season's most ambiguous dress code. Deciphering the party season's most ambiguous dress code. While it may seem like 'cocktail attire' is an empty phrase stamped on every invitation‚Äîone that serves no purpose but to make you agonize over the uncertainty of its sartorial meaning‚Äîconsider it in the context of the event details and it may start to make a bit more sense. Take into account the event purpose, in addition to the time and place. Your best friend's wedding will require very different attire than a corporate event or fashion party. Furthermore, an event taking place at a swanky hotel will call for a dressier outfit than something held at a restaurant around other non-guests/patrons, and definitely more so than a party held at someone's home. Check out the hours, too‚Äîevening start times typically suggest a more formal f√™te than those scheduled earlier in the afternoon or day.  While some hosts like a private affair, others create their own hashtags and would feel utterly offended if you didn't tag them. Always dress like the paps will be there, but make sure you're clear on whether the event is social-media friendly or not. If your host/hostess is known to be old-fashioned or traditional, dress more conservatively than you would if the host were especially avant-garde. Your fashion editor friend will likely have a more relaxed interpretation of cocktail attire than your boyfriend's Republican parents.  Choose an ensemble that is appropriate for the time of year and style it accordingly. A colorful floral number and strappy sandals might be just right for a springtime soir√©e, while a winter event will likely call for closed-toed shoes and an evening coat. Editor's tip: A touch of fur is ultra-glam for cold-weather months. If it's around the holidays, the dress code tends to open up to include options with a festive bent (think metallics and siren red). In a season of red, green, velvet and anything shimmery, you can't go wrong with a great black silk slip dress. It's elegant, easy and foolproof. Sleek hair is its best accessory. While minimalist girls like Pernille may not be caught dead in overall sequins, one standout item like shoulder-sweeping crystal earrings takes her festive miles. Keep the rest of the look streamlined but elegant and let your bijoux do all the heavy holiday lifting.  Appropriate lengths fall somewhere between mid-thigh and mid-calf. Save floor-skimming gowns for black tie affairs, and definitely reserve dangerously short minis for nightclubs and bachelorette parties.  The English love a good fascinator, the French still opt for berets, and Rihanna is embracing the bucket. While the idea of donning a hat for an evening affair sounds like a throw-back, it feels truly modern right now. Have fun with your toppers and take a fun fashion risk this holiday season.  In the wise words of Karl Lagerfeld, "One is never over-dressed or under-dressed with a Little Black Dress." That being said, don't feel limited to only black options. Play with color‚Äîanother element that is best informed by the time of year. For spring, a romantic pink or soft pastel. For summer go bold in something bright. For fall, rich earth tones and warm neutrals. And winter, deep jewel tones in luxe textures like satin or velvet.  Know your audience, but if the venue is casual and you're feeling like getting creative, skip the LBD, throw on some jeans, a cool top and major shoes that stand out in a crowd. You'll instantly be the coolest girl next to a Christmas tree.  Despite what you may see on the red carpet‚Äîyour upcoming event may not be the appropriate opportunity to test-drive a naked dress. Or, if you're dying to try something out of the ordinary (we understand, it's not every day you get to do this) interpret the trend or look in a way that is a bit more palatable. Try a style with strategically placed sheer insets instead of something entirely see-through, or offset a plunging neckline with long sleeves. Especially if an event takes place straight after office hours, a sleek blazer and trousers combo is an elegant look that is easy to dress up for evening. Just change your blouse (or remove it altogether) and swap your satchel for a clutch. A jumpsuit is also a great option for similar reasons.  Pick a small purse that will fit the bare essentials and opt for a handheld version like a clutch or diminutive top-handle. Cocktail events are a no-carryall zone.  Remember what Marnie said about Hannah on Girls: "She'll put on a good dress and nice shoes and then do her lipstick, and then leave her forehead shiny. It's like, you've come this far, wash your forehead!" A little light concealer or powder and a swipe of mascara are essential‚Äîand we can't stress enough the transformational powers of a good lipstick. If your hair is giving you anxiety, a low chignon is an easy, never-fail option that works for any occasion.  We rarely say this, but consider your comfort level. Parties are as much about the socializing as they are about the style, and if you're not at ease in your ensemble it will affect how enjoyable your evening is.  There is no single blanket statement that can be applied without exception‚Äîthere's a time and place for everything. For example, a cascading boho maxi for a beachside summer soir√©e: totally appropriate. A supremely elegant pair of flats for an evening affair: tricky but doable. But showing up to a wedding wearing white, or an upscale cocktail party in jeans and sneakers? Not okay‚Äînot now, not ever. If you're at a total loss, check in with the host/hostess to clarify the appropriate level of dress.

 From metallics to combat boots, something crystal, and something slouchy. Are you down for crystal-embellished sandals? Square-toe shoes? Something slouchy? A solid combat boot? Shoes are as varied as they are cool for fall 2019. See eight standout trends we're getting behind now. And shop the looks, of course.   The combat boot is officially back. It serves as the perfect counterpart to ultra-feminine dresses, as seen on Caroline Daur. A classic gets a remix. A sleek take on a go-to. A slouch boot‚Äîespecially one that's more sleek '80s than cool '70s‚Äîis having a moment. It's the ideal counterpart to high-waist jeans and minidresses. The black boot to embrace for fall. Bottega Veneta's square-toe shoes are one of the standout looks of the season. Continue your infatuation with minimal, strappy sandals well into fall. These are perfect shoes to pair with all of your¬†vintage denim. The white boot is going strong‚Äîthis season it works best slim and at knee height.  These are your go-with-every-dress-and-make-it-better boots. A girl can never go wrong with an animal-print boot. We love the look with black leather separates come fall. How does one get through a full season without a little leopard print? Or perhaps skip the boot and opt for an '80s inspired zebra print pump instead? Pair with high-waisted skinny black trousers for instant impact. A simple pump feels right on time right now. Paired with skinny black pants and a jacket, this look is both approachable and very cool.  Just try not to wear these every day. A little sparkle goes a long way in your evening sandal game. But take note: These babies are no longer just for evening. For when you're really feeling #extra. Metallic booties lend just the unexpected flair your basics, like an LBD or white skinnies, require. Whether you're a gold or silver girl, something with some shine can't help but brighten your day.
 A fashionable night ‚Äî and $1.8 million in charitable donations. Last Thursday's Plates for Pediatrics Gala, held at the Mandarin Oriental in New York City, brought together NYC celebrity and philanthropy. This year's charity gala was put on in partnership with luxury retailer Saks Fifth Avenue to raise money for NewYork-Presbyterian Komansky Children's Hospital. Co-hosted by Dr. Gerald Loughlin, the hospital's Pediatrician-in-Chief and Dr. Laura L. Forese, executive vice president and chief operating officer, the event drew more than five hundred attendees from Manhattan and the greater New York Metropolitan area for a black-tie dinner and presentation, celebrating the important technological advancements, developments, and research initiatives of the pediatric hospital. Last year's sold-out Plates for Pediatrics event, which was presented in partnership with chief benefactor Carolina Herrera and celebrated Drew Barrymore as the event's Honorary Chair, boasted a monetary donation amount of $1.2 million. Last week's event, the seventh annual Plates for Pediatrics gala, exceeded the 2017 donation, raising a new-record $1.8 million. Aside from being an important night, in support of the pediatric hospital, the gala also housed a wealth of fashion faces and influencers. Something Navy's Arielle Charnas was in attendance, showing off her growing pregnancy belly in a floor-length dark blue Rubin Singer long-sleeved fitted sequin evening gown. Charnas was photographed before the event alongside Dr. Gerald Loughlin and Candice Miller, co-founder of the sister-started brand Mama & Tata, who wore a stunning strapless vintage Nina Ricci gown. Other notable female philanthropic attendees included: Sak's chief merchant Tracy Margolies, Sunny with an A founder Sana Clegg, Kate Davis, Amanda Waldron, Travis Acquavella, Merrill Curtis, and Jessie Kisling.

 Both women have the same lace DVF dress in their closets.  Meghan Markle may not be an official member of the royal family just yet, but it seems she's already been on the same style wavelength as Kate Middleton for quite some time now.  Last night, the Duchess of Cambridge attended a gala at Kensington Palace and for the occasion, she wore a black lace gown by Diane von Furstenberg. The expecting royal, who's currently in the second trimester of her pregnancy, previously wore the same DVF dress back in November 2014 when she was pregnant with Princess Charlotte.  But the Duchess-approved 'Zarita' dress by DVF has already been worn by Meghan Markle in the past‚Äîmaking for an unexpected royal twinning moment between the two women. The Suits actress, who's currently dating Prince Harry (and sparking major engagement speculation), stepped out in the same lace dress for a red carpet appearance back in 2012. Markle, however, opted for a short, navy blue version of the dress while Middleton went for a black full-length version.    Five years later, DVF still carries the same lace dress (which both women prove is a timeless wardrobe essential) and miraculously, some of the colors and styles are still in stock for those who want to channel Middleton and Markle's look. In fact, the short black version is currently on sale for $139 at dvf.com.  Despite the fact that Markle and Prince Harry have been dating for over a year now, the two have kept a relatively low profile and the actress has yet to make any public appearances alongside Kate Middleton. But if their twinning DVF dress moment is any indication, the two women are bound to make a dynamic style duo in the future.
 Both Bella and Gigi Hadid didn't make the cut initially. For models, the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show is the pinnacle of pinnacles ‚Äî the fashion world's Super Bowl, Olympics, Oscars, and Emmys all rolled into one. And scoring a place on that coveted runaway as a model ‚Äî newcomer or veteran ‚Äî is a feat to be respected. Not all who try out for the position are given a place on the catwalk ‚Äî after all, only around 50 women are selected from a pool of hundreds. But getting knocked down once or twice shouldn't deter models from trying again. In fact, several models have been rejected at one point or another, before going on to walk in later shows, and even ‚Äî in some cases ‚Äî become Angels. Here, our favorite VSFS comeback stories. Bella told Paper Magazine she didn't make the cut in 2015. On her 2016 casting, she said: "I was really surprised, but definitely excited. I tried last year [to be cast in] the show [but] I think everything happens for a reason." Gigi failed to get the job in 2014. She told Live With Kelly and Michael: "I was working out every day, and I felt my body was really ready. I was healthy, athletic and ready for the show but I think that the only thing that got in my way was genuinely how nervous I was. I can't tell you how scary it is walking into that room, it is so scary." Although she's now an Angel, Sampaio didn't book the gig straight away. She told Vogue: "The first year I didn't get picked it was okay. The second time I didn't make it, it was like a knife. It is something you work all year for and when you don't make you it you really start doubting yourself. The third time I thought 'I'm not giving them any excuse not to pick me'. This is a very special booking, you have to earn your way into it." Aussie model Bridget Malcolm auditioned twice before being cast on her third try, she told the Daily Mail: "This was the third year I cast for the show... The first two years I was turned away. The first year was because I wasn't in good enough shape and the second year I wasn't confident enough to pull it off." In a video for the show, Tookes explained: "The first time I auditioned, I didn't end up making the show. I didn't take it personally because I knew I just needed to grow up a bit more. I was 18." On her failed auditions, Taylor told Vogue Australia: "I think it means more when you are rejected and then you do get it. And so many girls go year after year and they don't get it and put so much work into it for nothing. I mean it's quite shattering and I've spoken to girls that are devastated, just crying. There's so much that goes into getting your body ready and getting mentally ready for that confidence for 30 seconds while you're at the casting so it's quite stressful."

 The top model confronted an unknown catwalker.  While Versace had Jennifer Lopez, and Prada and Burberry both brought back old school catwalkers like Freja Beha Erichsen and Agyness Deyn‚ÄîChanel got a surprise catwalker that they didn't ask for at their Spring 2020 show this morning in Paris.  Inside the Grand Palais, while models like Kaia Gerber, Tami Williams, and Anna Ewers took their finale walk on a set that looked like rooftops in Paris, a woman from the crowd scurried down the steps from the audience and hopped onto the catwalk. Thanks to her black and white houndstooth tweed outfit (it's unknown if she was wearing Chanel) she actually blended right in with the cast of Chanel-clad models, although her mimic of a supermodel strut definitely drew attention.  In other news, someone crashed the Chanel show on the final day of Paris Fashion Week. She blended in so well the security had a difficult time finding her. pic.twitter.com/zJoZ7fleTu Most of the models managed to remain composed during the bizarre incident, but model Gigi Hadid decided to take matters into her own hand and confronted her. As the crasher got to the top of the set and started striking poses for the photographers, Hadid spoke to the woman, and then was seen placing her hand on her shoulder to help usher the woman towards the backstage exit before Virginie Viard came out for her bow.   Gigi saves the finale of the Chanel show from a catwalk crasher! @gigihadid @chanelofficial A post shared by  Carine Roitfeld (@carineroitfeld) on Oct 1, 2019 at 4:05am PDT According to WWD, the crasher was indentified as Marie Benoliel, also known as Marie S‚ÄôInfiltre, a comedian/YouTube personality with 227,000 subscribers. Earlier in the week she also crashed the Etam lingerie show and shared the photos on her instagram page of herself clad in silver metallic lingerie with a sleep mask walking behind model Cindy Bruna.

 It's the end of an era.  After parting ways with creative director Raf Simons and skipping a season of New York Fashion Week, it seems Calvin Klein may be done with its runway collection for good.  According to reports from WWD, the American fashion brand is closing its Calvin Klein Collection label, which became known as CalvinKlein205W39NYC under Simons in 2017. Given the decision to eliminate its runway division, the company is laying off employees who worked for the runway label as well‚Äîincluding 50 employees in its New York office and 50 in the Milan office. Additionally, the brand is said to be closing its Milan office altogether.  The news comes after Raf Simons‚Äô departure as chief creative officer in December. The designer's vision under the 205W39NYC brand was reportedly too luxe for Calvin Klein's core customers, who preferred the brand's denim, underwear, and fragrance divisions. Originally, Calvin Klein said it had planned to relaunch its runway collection under a new name and creative direction. In January, the brand also announced the closure of its New York collection flagship store at 654 Madison Ave. At the time, nearly 100 employees were let ago across the entire company, including the flagship store.    Calvin Klein first began showing at New York Fashion Week in 1994. The brand instantly became known for its cool, minimalist designs and denim that helped shape '90s fashion as a whole. It also helped skyrocket the modeling career of Kate Moss, cementing her status as a grunge icon and the face of "heroin chic" during the decade.    BAZAAR.com has reached out to Calvin Klein for a comment and will update this space. 
 Fashion journalist Alexander Fury pens an essay on the freedom of fashion designers and where the industry stands.  It's a clich√© to say that fashion is shifting‚Äîfashion always shifts. It is, by its very nature, malleable and mutable, each season transforming itself, and hopefully you, into something new. It is an industry predicated on a perpetual dynamic of change, of constant renewal, of fresh blood. These changes can be invigorating. They can reset the eye. Really great fashion can shift not just the what but the why, altering not only the physical form of the clothes on your back but the psychological ramifications of wearing them. Fashion can shift perceptions of the self. But at the moment fashion seems to be preoccupied with its shifting perceptions of itself. The current landscape‚Äîas with so many landscapes‚Äîis in peril. Long-held ‚Äúrules‚Äù are being questioned, rewritten, or scrapped entirely. The biannual fashion calendar has been tossed out, with designers showing their clothes between seasons, on men and women simultaneously, and in weeks traditionally reserved for one or the other. Designers are selling their wares straight off the runway‚Äî ‚Äúsee now, buy now,‚Äù in the industry parlance‚Äîor hoarding imagery altogether until their clothes hit the rack. Houses are staging shows in more intimate settings, like private garages (Ralph Lauren) or their own ateliers (Maison Margiela), while others thirstily live-stream every stitch. Alexander Wang staged his show on the streets of New York this fall, to the delight of passing tourists. The rules are, there are no rules, as Aristotle Onassis once said. It‚Äôs a free-for-all in free fall. The signs have been there for years‚Äîthe dominance of social platforms, the ever-growing number of collections, the ascendance of the consumer as arbiter of contemporary taste, and the general need for speed. But the repercussions of these gradual changes in the fashion climate are being felt only now, and with seismic force. This has been, understandably, discombobulating for anyone caught up in the maelstrom. Which explains the prevailing attitude of today‚Äîlooking back rather than forward. Revivals are rife, and have been for the past decade at least; the latest favorite is fashion houses hurrahing anniversaries, or installing new designers at moribund labels to give them fresh life (again, that‚Äôs been going on for a while, albeit with increasing alacrity). Why? Because history speaks of stability, of perpetuity. If a brand has survived, successfully, for 50 years, 70 years, even a century, there‚Äôs no reason to believe that it won‚Äôt survive that long again. Anniversaries are proof of staying power, which is all-important in a fickle landscape. History is comforting because the past is assured. Early last year, I met with Pierre Berg√©, cofounder of the house of Yves Saint Laurent. It was only a few months before he passed away, rightly acclaimed as one of the architects of modern fashion: ‚ÄúLe Force.‚Äù When I asked Berg√© about history‚Äîthis man who created so much of it‚Äîhe pursed his lips and spat out a phrase that resonated with me: ‚ÄúI hate the past. I hate nostalgia.‚Äù It‚Äôs a sentiment echoed in the words of Karl Lagerfeld. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt reinterpret the past. I‚Äôm pretentious enough to say that we invent something for today,‚Äù he told me after his Fall 2017 couture show. Lagerfeld isn‚Äôt looking back; he‚Äôs looking around, drawing the spirit of the moment into his creations. Fashion‚Äôs great movers and shakers, its true forward-thinkers, are embracing the new uncertainty and challenging the old boundaries. They think with Berg√©‚Äôs mind-set. It‚Äôs not a case of destroying traditions, far from it. But it is an acknowledgment that evolution, perhaps, isn‚Äôt enough‚Äîrevolution is the only way to jolt us out of complacency. The designer Azzedine Ala√Øa, for instance, is often talked about as a ‚Äúrule breaker,‚Äù but it‚Äôs usually in a superficial way. No one has ever been able to comprehend why he chooses not to present his collections at the same time as everyone else, even as the show schedules become clogged with designers who, in all honesty, neither need nor deserve to be there. Just as Ala√Øa‚Äôs home is far away from the headquarters of other Paris houses‚Äîin the Marais, where real people actually live‚Äîhe has removed himself from the fashion melee. ‚ÄúI am free,‚Äù he once told me. ‚ÄúIf I don‚Äôt feel it, I don‚Äôt do it. I always feel free. This is my strength.‚Äù He also told me that, if he had just one new idea a year, he would be happy. Two new ideas? ‚ÄúGenius!‚Äù Ala√Øa is filled with ideas, but he doesn‚Äôt always consider them new. He has eschewed the pursuit of relentless novelty in favor of perfecting his own style and aesthetic, confident that others will be won over by his vision. He‚Äôs right. Ala√Øa is joined by relatively few others‚ÄîRick Owens, Alessandro Michele at Gucci, Miuccia Prada, to name a few‚Äîwhose choices will inform the careers of generations of designers. They refuse to obey rules because they make their own. And, at the moment, they are ripping apart fashion‚Äôs etiquette book and demanding serious change. ‚ÄúPeople say that I‚Äôm a punk,‚Äù Miuccia Prada said with a laugh after showing her Spring 2018 collection of studs and torn-looking prints. Again, superficiality, but she meant punk in attitude, which is understandable. Prada actively rejects not tradition but convention, trying to find a different path. "The future of fashion rests with designers who lead rather than follow. In bold moves and upheavals." ‚ÄúI like to create things that appear attractive, easy, but that afterward‚Äîdepending on the culture of the person‚Äîwill make the wearer feel something else,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThe sophisticated person looks at everything. Someone superficial gets only the facade.‚Äù This ability to do both‚Äîto deliver beauty, but also a deeper message for those who care to discover it‚Äîis what unites fashion‚Äôs rule breakers. ‚ÄúI read a lot about what is right, and what is wrong, as if you have to follow some code,‚Äù Alessandro Michele tells me. ‚ÄúThis is something that can kill fashion and creativity.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have to do anything I don‚Äôt want to do,‚Äù adds Rick Owens, echoing the words of Ala√Øa. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm obligated to make any compromises, which is a wonderful thing. I probably sound a little gloating when I say that‚Äîa little boastful‚Äîbut it‚Äôs significant. I could just burn the whole place down if I wanted to.‚Äù So perhaps it‚Äôs freedom from traditional rules that will create the future of fashion‚Äîa refusal to conform to the demands of the industry, however you perceive them. In their way, all these designers are challenging convention, and winning, creating the fresh rules that others wind up following. When you talk to these designers‚Äîthe names who are defining what we wear this very minute‚Äîcommon themes emerge. A loathing of the superficial, a disdain for conformity, a prizing of independence. And as you look at their collections, you realize that it isn‚Äôt just about the clothes; it‚Äôs about the entire universe each of them has been able to create‚Äîabout Michele‚Äôs Gucci stores transformed into tactile playgrounds; about Ala√Øa‚Äôs converted warehouse in the Marais, a Valhalla containing his work and living spaces, a boutique, and a pair of Julian Schnabel smashed-plate portraits. It‚Äôs about Rick Owens‚Äôs furniture, his two-ton alabaster beds, and petrified-wood-and-antler chairs, and about Miuccia Prada‚Äôs Via Fogazzaro teatro reinvented, endlessly, for each new iteration of her ideas. Yet those worlds all lead back to the clothes. They aren‚Äôt set dressing or a distraction; they are frames to emphasize and contextualize proscenium arches under which fashion is acted out. The focus is on the performers‚Äînot the models, but the garments. Designers creating worlds isn‚Äôt anything especially new‚Äîin the 1930s, Elsa Schiaparelli had her shocking-pink Surrealist salon on the Place Vend√¥me; in the ‚Äô40s, Christian Dior his dove-gray Louis Seize revival townhouse on Avenue Montaigne. They were, aesthetically and creatively, worlds apart. What is new are the clothes designers are creating to populate them. The future of fashion lies there‚Äîin the actual nuts and bolts of designing garments. There are already tectonic movements afoot: the way a designer like Michele creates his collections‚Äîpulling from a wide-ranging and esoteric landscape of references‚Äîhas not only been altered but also reengineered by the advent of the Internet, which allows designers access to every image ever produced. The next generation of designers‚Äîthose brought up in the digital age, with the Web as a lifelong companion‚Äîwill reflect how that access has reprogrammed the human brain. The Web scientist Michael K. Bergman has compared plugging search terms into Google to dragging a net across the ocean. You may catch something, but there are fathoms you can‚Äôt fathom. That‚Äôs where we are right now with the impact of digital on design. It‚Äôs not changing the way we look, inasmuch as it‚Äôs transforming the way we experience, the way we think. Given all this, it‚Äôs fair to say that the way the next generation of designers will create clothes will have little to do with how clothes are made now. They certainly won‚Äôt think about them the same way. They already don‚Äôt. Which brings us back to Monsieur Berg√©‚Äîto the essentiality of a designer living in his or her time, and creating clothes that reflect it. There was a similarly seismic moment in the late 1960s, when youth quaked and rebelled, and a dynamic young couturier named Yves Saint Laurent came up with a novel idea‚Äîready-to-wear‚Äîthat democratized fashion, broke down old class hierarchies, and made designer clothing accessible to all. ‚ÄúBecause he lived in our time,‚Äù Berg√© explained. The future of fashion rests with designers who lead rather than follow. In bold moves and upheavals. In designers who are truly free.

 It's Malibu meets Paris meets Cool Teen‚Ñ¢ Earlier this year, we got word that supermodel-in-the-making Kaia Gerber was slated to design her first fashion collection with none other than Karl Lagerfeld. And today, we're finally getting a first look at the collaboration between the legendary designer and rising It model.  The Karl x Kaia collection, which will include both ready-to-wear and accessories, will be sold exclusively on Karl.com and Revolve.com‚Äîanother move that proves that the Lagerfeld brand is further tapping into a younger demographic. Half Malibu, half Paris, and fully Cool Teen‚Ñ¢-approved, the pieces are a mashup of the duo's contrasting styles.    It‚Äôs official: KARL LAGERFELD will introduce an exclusive collection designed with model-of-the moment @kaiagerber, launching August 30. Comment below if you're excited! #KARLXKAIA A post shared by  KARL LAGERFELD (@karllagerfeld) on Aug 20, 2018 at 12:01am PDT In campaign images shared by WWD, Kaia models several looks from the collab, including a wetsuit-inspired outfit, lots of leather, cool suiting separates, and some unexpected pink pieces. There's also a range of sunglasses, jewelry, bags, and hats in the mix as well.  The fall collection will be available to shop starting August 30 and coinciding with its launch, the brand will host a series of events held in LA, New York, and Paris. No word yet on what those events will entail, but it's likely you can expect Kaia, Karl, and lots of Instagram-worthy moments.  With an incredible debut runway season and several major campaigns already under her belt (Chanel included), the 16-year-old's first big design project is just the latest feat in her rise to achieving It model status.   Karl Lagerfeld has teamed up with model-of-the-moment Kaia Gerber on a collaboration for his namesake brand. The Karl Lagerfeld x Kaia capsule, launching Aug. 30, is the company‚Äôs largest collab to date. #wwdnews #karllagerfeld #kaiagerber A post shared by  WWD (@wwd) on Aug 20, 2018 at 4:13am PDT Despite the fact that it's only been one year since she first made her runway debut at Calvin Klein during New York Fashion Week, Kaia has already walked four Chanel shows, the first of which she opened‚Äîa huge feat for any model.  With this collection, Lagerfeld is likely looking to replicate the success of Tommy Hilfiger's collaboration with Gigi Hadid. The ongoing collaboration produced four collections and runway shows, reportedly sky-rocketing sales at Hilfiger thanks to Hadid's top model influence.  Given Kaia's rising influence in the fashion world, it's likely her collaboration with Karl will produce similar results‚Äîand perhaps even more collections in the future?

 From the return of the runway twirl to '80s overload.  This season's New York Fashion Week lineup may have been missing a ton of big shows‚Äîplus the absence of Rihanna's Fenty Puma and Kanye West's Yeezy‚Äîbut there were still plenty of moments worth noting. From models bringing back the runway twirl to Carolina Herrera taking her final bow and Cardi B lighting up the front row, here's a recap of all the Fall 2018 show highlights.   @kaiagerber twirling down the runway in a luxe metallic parka! ‚ú® #AnnaSuiFall18 Regram: @wwd A post shared by  Anna Sui (@annasui) on Feb 13, 2018 at 1:51pm PST Bringing that '90s supermodel fierceness back to the runway, Kaia Gerber whipped out an incredible twirl down the catwalk at Anna Sui‚Äîcomplete with the perfect hair flip and attitude. There was also some noteworthy twirling happening at Brandon Maxwell's Fall 2018 show. At a time when Fashion Week lacks some of its magic, this is a runway trend we'd be happy to see revived‚Äîwatch and learn from Kaia's flawless execution in the above video.  For his final show during the traditional NYFW calendar, Wang took over the old Cond√© Nast building at 4 Times Square with the "Alexander Wang Group." Merging together Working Girl with The Matrix, the runway was staged down a row of gray cubicles. Echoing the show's setting, the collection was comprised of '80s-inspired corporate looks and office-friendly attire (plus tights bedazzled with "CEO"). Typically known for dressing the downtown party girl and his wild #WangFest during Fashion Week, it was a swift departure to see the brand buttoned up and ready to take on the 9-to-5 life.  Power suits, colorful tights, the color magenta‚Äîthe runways were infused with '80s overload. The decade of opulence saw a major revival in the form of strong shouldered silhouettes, dramatic earrings, and even the Working Girl look. Get ready for a glamorous dose of color and style next fall.   From left: Adam Selman, Marc Jacobs, Tom Ford, Alexander Wang Desmond Napoles, a self-proclaimed "drag kid," became the youngest drag star to walk NFYW at Gypsy Sport's Fall 2018 show. Napoles, who's best-known for his fashion and beauty-filled Instagram, is an LGBTQ advocate who created a drag house for kids who enjoy dressing in drag, just like him. The 10-year-old hit the runway in a black corseted look, white and black nails, and slicked silver hair‚Äîpaving the way for a huge win for the LGBTQ youth.  In the midst of the Time's Up and #MeToo movements, one would have assumed more designers would use their Fall 2018 shows to make feminist statements, but only a few brands actually did. Kicking off the week, Tom Ford sent sparkling "Pussy Power" bags and pumps down the runway, adding a dose of female empowerment to his flashy, '80s dosed collection. Prabal Gurung, always one to bring activism to the runway, filled his backstage area with inspiring feminist posters, and staged a beautiful finale with models linking arms down the runway. He also invited #MeToo founder Tarana Burke to sit front row for her first fashion show ever. Alice + Olivia's Stacey Bendet, meanwhile, staged "Alice + Olivia University" for her Fall 2018 presentation. The spectacle included a "We The Women" Bill of Rights along with imagery of suffragettes as a backdrop to some of the looks. "By looking at the women‚Äôs movements past and present, I wanted this presentation to pay homage to strong women throughout history, to show how far we have come and how far we still need to go," Bendet said in the show notes.  While this season's shows were star-studded with plenty of A-list-filled front rows, it was Whoopi Goldberg and Cardi B who stole the scene at the most shows. The rapper made appearances at Wang, Marc Jacobs, Christian Siriano, Prabal Gurung, and more‚Äîkilling it with her front row style. Whoopi, meanwhile, enjoyed another season of shows‚Äîturning up everywhere from Ulla Johnson to R13 and Christian Siriano in a variety of statement-making shoes from zebra print clogs to hot pink pom pom shoes.  Though many brands noticeably brought more diversity to the runways this season, Chromat took things to the next level with a truly diverse cast of models. Along with featuring several plus-size models, Viktoria Modesta, an amputee singer-songwriter, also walked the show while wearing a prosthetic leg. Making for another powerful moment, breast cancer survivor Ericka Hart revealed her double mastectomy scars while modeling a sheer, neon look down the runway. Featuring a multitude of races, sizes, and body types, Chromat's cast was an inspiring highlight of the week.   The timeless elegance of @carolinaherrera üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªBrava üß°üíô‚ù§Ô∏èüíö A post shared by  Nina Garcia (@ninagarcia) on Feb 12, 2018 at 6:05pm PST Before handing over the creative reins to Wes Gordon, Carolina Herrera presented her final collection on Monday night. Paying homage to the designer's signature look, the finale was a colorful series of crisp white button-downs, taffeta ball gown skirts, and contrasting wide belts. It was a beautiful sendoff for Herrera, who has led her eponymous fashion house for 37 years.  Marking the tenth anniversary of his brand, Christian Siriano staged a blowout show featuring 72 looks and an endless amount of red carpet glamour. Staying true to his runways that celebrate all body types and races, the casting was diverse and also included the runway debuts of actresses Danielle Brooks and Selma Blair, along with Siriano's sister. The collection itself was filled with endless Oscar-worthy gowns, many of which will likely have a standout red carpet moment this season.   Bringing Black Panther to NYFW, Marvel Studios teamed up with seven designers to create custom looks inspired by the film's fashion. The designs were unveiled at a special "Welcome To Wakanda" event in the midst of the week, which was also attended by the movie's cast. All seven looks are currently being auctioned off on CharityBuzz.com, with proceeds being donated to Save The Children.  BID ON THE BLACK PANTHER PIECES HERE For Calvin Klein's Fall 2018 collection, Raf Simons covered the floor of the former American Stock Exchange building in a sea of popcorn. The snack design element, as it turns out, was not a fun and happy notion‚Äîbut part of a darker collection that explored the history and future of America through a dystopian-like lens. From the set (which was comprised of three burned-down barns adorned with Andy Warhol paintings) to the collection itself, the show was a complex mashup of American identity and politics‚Äîmaking quite the statement during an otherwise tame week of show themes.  Ending the week on a note of over-the-top glamour, Marc Jacobs closed things with the ultimate '80s-inspired collection. Complete with dramatic, oversized silhouettes, sharp hats, and vibrant colors, the show was a larger-than-life culmination of the week's many '80s-inspired runways.

 The brand has made a name for itself in the accessories realm, and now it's taking on ready-to-wear. We love Loeffler Randall lookbooks: those charming, feminine shoes and bags paired with nondescript ready-to-wear in fields of flowers or chic homes. We want to live the life those lookbooks evoke. Now, Loeffler Randall is taking control of those ready-to-wear pieces‚Äîand helping us create that life‚Äîwith a new capsule collection, launching today. Designer Jessie Randall founded her brand in 2005, remaining true to a vision of creating beautiful, wearable accessories for real women, an ethos she is now using to also outfit those women. Starting small, her ready-to-wear collection includes a ruffle hem skirt, two dresses, and a top. Scroll through the lookbook below, shop the collection, and learn why it took almost 15 years into designing for Randall to take on clothing, as well as what‚Äôs next for the New York-based brand. Why did you want to launch ready-to-wear? We started this capsule collection with the idea of designing dresses we‚Äôd like to wear with our shoes‚Äîfrom our signature Penny heels to our easy Lilla sandals to our tall Goldy boots. That was the inspiration behind this limited capsule of ready-to-wear pieces. I loved the idea of starting very small, making an edited selection of pieces in tiny batches that are only available on our site. Realizing the full LR look from shoes to bags to jewelry and now clothing is a dream come true. Why did now feel like the right time? Fashion is changing so rapidly right now. It used to be so much about strict categories, but it isn‚Äôt any more. We are designing the pieces that our girl wants, whether they are earrings or shoes or clothing. It‚Äôs so much fun for me to work this way. I find each category inspires the next.  SHOP NOW How do the pieces reflect the shoes and bags? We shoot beautiful campaigns each season, and we are constantly pulling small brands for styling. We started to think about how fun it would be to just have our own clothing to style with. So the clothing really came out of the shoes and bags in the sense of they were the pieces we want to wear with our accessories. The full look! What was the inspiration for the collection? We were inspired by femininity and the clothing we want to wear ourselves. We started with the inspo of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the Penny version of a dress?‚Äù And it evolved from there.  SHOP NOW Had you had any experience in designing RTW prior to this? Yes! I used to make clothing at LR many years ago, and I recently got very interested in it again.  How often will new collections hit? We are thinking about tiny, more frequent drops. It‚Äôs so freeing not to have to design a huge, mammoth collection. Instead it will be small runs of just the item we are feeling for at that moment in time. I love how spontaneous and creative we can be with this project.  SHOP NOW Will this be DTC or wholesale? We are always thinking about ways we can grow our direct-to-consumer business. It‚Äôs wonderful to have that direct connection and dialogue with our customers. This project is only available on our website.  Who do you see as the Loeffler Randall woman? I think she‚Äôs very similar to me and to the women who work at LR (our company is 94 percent female). We are creative women leading busy and fulfilling lives. We want our clothes and shoes to reflect who we are, and we want these pieces to do a lot of work for us. We want them to last a long time and to feel relevant season to season. We want to wear them from school drop-off to work to out to dinner and beyond.  SHOP NOW Who would be your dream person to see in it? My team. I love seeing the excitement of my team around this project. We are a company of women designing products for and by ourselves. So when my team loves something, I have a hunch others will too.  Have you kept sustainability in mind? Absolutely. We create in small batches, and our aim is always to sell out. We are thoughtful about what we put into the world and have really ramped up our sustainability efforts at LR. For this collection, we worked with a vertical factory, which means they own a mill and the factory. They developed the linen, twill, and voile materials we are using, and they are doing all the washing and printing themselves. Our pieces are meant to be worn season to season, year after year, occasion after occasion. This isn‚Äôt disposable stuff. It‚Äôs meant to be worn and cherished over time.  SHOP NOW What‚Äôs your ultimate goal for the brand?  I love the feeling of designing things that truly bring joy to people. And I don‚Äôt think you can understate the meaningful joy and confidence that a beautifully designed pair of shoes or a dress have the potential to bring. We always feel incredibly honored that women choose our designs to wear to an important interview, to a special event, and even their wedding. So I guess for me, my goal is to bring that joy to people and to continue to grow the brand so more people can know about LR and wear it.

 These fashion insiders break down their best looks for NYFW. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. In the latest episode of This Look is Money, some emerging names in the fashion game show off what they're wearing for the illustrious New York Fashion Week. Below, Gabriella Zacche, Tyler Joe, and Karen Blanchard breakdown their outfits that you can shop right now. Who are you wearing? How much did it cost? What favors are you calling in? Think: something old, something new, something borrowed, and something bought resale. Prepare yourself for some major fashion inspiration. 
    Zacche, who describes her style as "city chic," opted for a pair of knee-high Fendi boots, which she says are a cute and comfortable option for walking around in between shows. She paired the bold boots with an equally bold dress by Ganni, which features a high neckline, big sleeves, and a concentric checkered pattern. Zacche also toted along a Dior saddle bag, which she purchased at a vintage shop in New York City. She continued to accessorize with tortoise shell Dior sunglasses and matching gold chain earrings and bracelet by Monica Vinader.   Although New York City photographer Tyler Joe is used to capturing the best of today's fashion while behind the lens of his camera, in this episode, he stepped in front of one to show off what he's wearing. He calls his style "a uniform with accents," donning a mostly monochrome look with pops of color, perfectly embodied by his white Raf Simons button-up. His sneakers are the lovechild of a collaboration between Nike and ACRONYM, featuring a black zipper and a panel of orange. He also wore Stan Ray painter pants‚Äìeven though, according to Joe, he doesn't paint. Holding his painter pants up is a gray 1KCorp belt. Joe's fit also includes a sentimental streak, personified by his simple gold chain gifted to him by his grandmother. He furthered the gold accessories with a ring by Tom Wood and a gold watch, passed down to him by his grandfather.    Fashion blogger Karen Blanchard, who runs Where Did U Get That, has a sense of fashion that mixes the best of thrifted and vintage finds with designer labels and high street looks. She based the foundation of this episode's look on a trusted pair of white Converse high-tops. "I've had Converses in my life since I was in college and university," Blanchard said. "So, it has a special place in my heart." She layered a glimmering, silver maxi dress from Zara underneath a dusty blue trench coat that she thrifted at Beacon's Closet. For accessories, she opted for a Dior saddle bag and a simple gold band, which she purchased from a street vendor. Watch the rest of the video above to see all the pieces Gabriella, Tyler, and Karen are wearing and add them to your cart.

 Olivier Rousteing teases how the collection was made. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. One of the most anticipated features of this year's Victoria's Secret Fashion Show is the VS x Balmain collaboration. Though the lingerie brand and the French fashion house have previously teased what to expect on the runway in Shanghai this year, a new video gives an even closer look at the upcoming collab. The clip shows Balmain's creative director, Olivier Rousteing, in his Parisian design studio, testing out a look from the collection on model Cindy Bruna back in June. (She first walked for VS in 2013.) Although her full ensemble isn't revealed head-to-toe, the footage gives away the signature Balmain design elements included in her look: black leather, studs, statement-making shoulders and a sexy silhouette. Just take a look at this first outfit, featuring what looks like a beaded and sequined oversized jacket, fishnet tights and over-the-knee boots: Then there's Bruna's spiked-up leather look up close: Check out that fun pink leather: And Cindy's dangerously spiked choker: This top comes with an open fringed back, with tassels covered in chains, crystals, beads and even more studs: And here are the boots up close: "We need to give to the public, which is a really incredible crowd, what they expect and even more, surprising them," Roustein says in the video. "So I think we worked all together to make sure that it's going to be a big shock. They're gonna be like, 'Oh wow, Balmain and Victoria's Secret together? It's like magic.'" The French label will be designing custom looks for the VS catwalk in Shanghai and collaborating with the lingerie brand for an in-store collection, available November 29. This will mark the first time VS has joined forces with a high fashion label for runway and retail. The 2017 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show will air on CBS on November 28th at 10 p.m.

 From furry accents to croc mania, the runway trends you can wear IRL.  Fall is officially here and a new crop of bag trends is about to make the transition much more enticing. As spotted on the runways from New York to Paris, handbags are noticeably more playful for Fall 2019. From doubling up to two bags at once to smaller-than-ever micros and shearling details, this season's best handbags are anything but basic.  Straight from the runways, these are the top trends to know and shop now.  Elevate your look with the help of a luxe croc-embellished bag. The trend took over runways from New York to Paris, done in everything from python-inspired textures to glam all-black box bags. Available at every price point, the trend comes in both real and faux iterations.  Clockwise from left: Bottega Veneta, Chlo√©, Lanvin Straight off the runway,¬†Chlo√©'s ultra-luxe take on croc adds just the right amount of texture, gloss, and color to any look.¬† Mango's croc-effect bucket bag looks way more luxe than its price tag. Wear it as a belt bag or cross body‚Äîeither way this rising bag designer looks equal parts luxe and cool.¬† A cream croc-effect bag brings an unexpected pop of winter white to all your cold weather looks.¬† You'll be able to snuggle up to your handbags this season. Shearling, faux fur, and fuzzy textures took over many of fall's must-have bags. From Chanel's cozy apr√®s-ski accessories to colorful shaggy totes at Off-White, your on-the-go essentials will definitely be keeping warm next fall. Clockwise from top left: Fendi, Off-White, Chanel, Staud   Add a little touch of apr√®s-ski to your everyday look with this cream shearling tote.¬† Fendi's most iconic bag now comes in luxe shearling form. Prepare for this one to take over your Instagram feed and the chicest models off duty.¬† The bucket bag gets a fresh update in this furry Mansur Gavriel design that's ready to combat chilly temperatures.¬† Structured handheld bags continued to go strong on the fall 2019 runways. From geometric shapes to hoop handles, some of the most standout bags were those too special to simply sling over your shoulder.  Clockwise from top left: Oscar de la Renta, Brandon Maxwell, Bottega Veneta, Marc Jacobs  An affordable take on the trend, Topshop's croc-effect box bag adds a little glam to any look‚Äîday or night. It may be small in size, but Cult Gaia's geometric bag can elevate the simplest of outfits.¬† A splurge-worthy box bag ideal for all your fancy nights out.¬† Two is better than one. Designers ranging from Off-White to Givenchy to Fendi made the case for your bag carrying a bag of its own. An ideal solution for those who can't fit all their essentials into one micro purse. Clockwise from top left: Rebecca Minkoff, Fendi, Off-White, Tod's Staud's double bags come in fashion's new favorite color: pistachio green.¬† Two bags in one: wear them solo or together to add a little streamlined '50s meets '70s vibe to your look.¬† Test-drive the look in belt-bag version with Acne's double fanny pack done in sleek leather.¬†¬† Good news for those rebelling against the mini-bag trend: Giant carryall totes are making their return for fall. From Proenza Schouler to Giambattista Valli, oversize bags staged a comeback on the runway. In the wise words of Fabolous, "Just throw it in the bag."  Clockwise from left: Proenza Schouler, Dior, Giambattista Valli An extra-large tote that comes in a smooth, buttery leather to lighten up your fall and winter wardrobe.¬† Straight from the runway,¬†Dior's oversize tote will fit all your essentials and (much) more.¬† Mansur Gavriel's beloved tote works for the office or a quick weekend getaway.¬† Chain straps are back in full force. JW Anderson supersized the look on its fall runway with an oversize gold chain strap, while Carolina Herrera, Altuzarra, Chlo√©, and more stuck with classic chains. Clockwise from top left: JW Anderson, Carolina Herrera, Altuzarra, Chlo√© For a more playful take on the trend, Yuzefi's chunky resin chain makes an instant style statement.¬† Add one of fall's hottest colors to your wardrobe in the form of this top handle bag that gets multiple trends done in one.¬† Keep it classic with this timeless leather shoulder bag that will remain a staple in your wardrobe for years to come.¬† Bags are continuing to shrink smaller and smaller. This season saw an all-time record, with Jacquemus's tiny bags that were barely big enough to fit a pair of AirPods. Designers like Ferragamo, however, managed to deliver micro bags that can still hold a tiny bit more. The takeaway? Only carry things that *truly* spark joy. Clockwise from top left: Jacquemus, Brandon Maxwell, Paco Rabanne, Ferragamo Jacquemus's micro mini bag, which is the perfect size to fit just a pair of AirPods or a mint, is one of fall's buzziest. The tiny accessory is currently available in lavender, red, and navy.¬† For those who need a little more room, By Far's mini cross-body is the perfect size, and this glossy red is perfect for fall.¬† You can wear this neutral-colored micro mini as a cross-body, making it a completely hands-free look.¬†
 Watching the living legend at work on the set of the Versace Campaign Sharlom Harlow is a supermodel‚Äînot an Instagram star turned model, but a real '90s-era supermodel. In case anyone forgot, we were lucky enough to be blessed with a little snippet from the cell phone of Donatella Versace on the scene of the Versace Spring 2019 campaign shoot with Steven Meisel.  Introducing the new #VersaceSS19 campaign featuring @shalomharlow in perfect Versace stance. #VersaceEverywhere _ Artistic Director: @donatella_versace  Photographer: #StevenMeisel Creative Ad Campaign Director: @ferdinandoverderi  Casting Director: @pg_dmcasting  Stylist: @kjeldgaard1  Makeup: @patmcgrathreal  Hair: @guidopalau A post shared by  Versace (@versace) on Dec 17, 2018 at 12:34am PST The now viral behind-the-scenes video features Harlow in the most in-your-face '70s-inspired jumpsuits with mix-matching prints, ruffles flaring out from her knees accompanied by hair teased to the heavens, dancing to some retro music.  Shalom serving us 200%!! Brava @shalomharlow! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è #VersaceSS19 #VersaceEverywhere #makingof #behindthescenes A post shared by  Donatella Versace (@donatella_versace) on Dec 17, 2018 at 3:44am PST It's hard not to become completely hypnotized by the model's perfectly-timed moves‚Äîespecially for those who aren't privy to the inner workings of high-fashion photo shoots. But even those on set were clearly entranced by the model as you can hear them cheering her along. The supermodel was most certainly bringing IT‚Äîdelivering what will now be an iconic image for the Italian brand. Harlow rose to fame in the early 1990s, she was discovered as a teen in Canada while at a The Cure concert in Toronto. She went from high school to fronting major magazine covers, walking the top runways from New York to Paris, and co-hosting MTV's House of Style with Amber Valetta. By 1997, the model transitioned into acting and has appeared in numerous TV shows and movies, including Vanilla Sky, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, and The Jury.    The model has been on hiatus from the fashion world, until early this month when she walked Versace's first show in New York City for their Pre-Fall 2019 collection. Harlow even led the finale walk at the end of the show. Prior to that, Harlow hadn't been seen on a runway since Alexander Wang's Fall 2012 show during New York Fashion Week. 
 Some are expected to sell for $90,000. Last week, it was revealed that Drake, like many of us, is a fan of Herm√®s Birkin bags. The only difference is that he's already started collecting these luxury handbags to give to his future wife, whoever she may be. "There's very few tangible things in this world that hold their value and appreciate as the years go on," Drizzy told The Hollywood Reporter. "It was one of those things that I started collecting as well for, I guess, the woman that I end up with one day. So I have a fairly vast collection of Herm√®s for that somebody at that point in life." Luckily for the Toronto rapper and his fellow Birkin fans, Christie's will sell some of these highly-coveted bags starting next week. The New York auction house's upcoming Handbags & Accessories sale (November 22 - December 5), includes select pieces from Herm√®s, Chanel, and even the hard-to-get Supreme x Louis Vuitton collaboration.

 Karl Lagerfeld photographs the 16-year-old in the brand's latest ads.  It's been less than a year since her runway debut, but Kaia Gerber is already taking the fashion world by storm.  The 16-year-old's latest accomplishment? Her first Chanel campaign. After walking in both ready-to-wear and couture shows for the French fashion house, Kaia is the new face of Chanel's Spring 2018 handbag ads. The black and white images, which were photographed by none other than Karl Lagerfeld, feature the supermodel-in-the-making posing with the brand's latest collection of bags. Making her first Chanel campaign even more special, Kaia was photographed in Mademoiselle Chanel‚Äôs apartment in Paris, surrounded by the late designer's personal belongings.  Amongst the handbags featured in the campaign are the brand's transparent PVC bags, which were spotted on the Spring 2018 runway, the Gabrielle bag, and the Chanel boy bag. Also impossible to miss in the ads? The model's incredibly long limbs stretched out across Chanel's plush sofas.  Of course, this is likely just the beginning of Kaia's journey as one of Karl Lagerfeld's Chanel muses. 
 Watch her hit the runway one last time. Last week in Shanghai, Alessandra Ambrosio walked the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show for the last time ever; and during last night's broadcast, her fans finally got to see her final appearance.  The 36-year-old Angel made two cameos during the show‚Äîone wearing the VS x Balmain collab, and another in a red beaded look. The latter marked her VS Fashion Show finale, and she made every step of it count. She even mouthed "I love you forever" from the front of the stage. Alessandra Ambrosio's last walk üò™#VSFashionShow #vsfs17 pic.twitter.com/YDiHUwJoPg Fans were not emotionally prepared to watch the goodbye: I still can‚Äôt believe this is the last time we‚Äôre watching Alessandra doing the VS fashion show üíî we‚Äôre gonna miss her so much #VSFashionShow Watching @AngelAlessandra walk her last #VSfashionshow runway like.... #VSFS2017 pic.twitter.com/uKm4KwwlCh Shortly after the broadcast, Ambrosio shared a clip of an interview she had backstage where she announced that this show would be her last. "It's been wonderful," she told reporters. It's like a dream come true. It's like, I never imagined in my life that I would be here 17 times, doing the best show on earth." She also shared a sweet parting message for her supporters and VS team. "So I just want to say to my fans, to my Victoria's Secret family, I love you guys," she added. "Thank you so much for the support. You'll always be in my heart and I'm always going to be cheering for you. Mwah!"  üíìüíìüíì #vsfashionshow A post shared by  Alessandra Ambrosio (@alessandraambrosio) on Nov 28, 2017 at 9:07pm PST The bittersweet interview echoed Ambrosio's goodbye message to Victoria's Secret, which she shared on Instagram last week. "Words cannot describe how grateful I am to have been working for this amazing brand that inspires me and women all over the world," she wrote. Ambrosio made her VS Fashion Show debut in 2000 and has become synonymous with the brand over her 17 years with the lingerie line. Now that she'll no longer be an Angel, she's moving on to focus on her other passions‚Äîher swim line, Ale by Alessandra, and spending more time on her acting career, the model told Entertainment Tonight.  Take a look back at Alessandra Ambrosio's VSFS evolution below: 

 2018 may not have flying cars, but it does have Beyonc√© wearing Slinkys as earrings. While the rest of us mere mortals have been accessorizing with hoop earrings, Beyonc√© is out here living in the year 3008 and wearing Slinkys as earrings. Yes, Queen Bey took the toy you spent hours watching go down the stairs as a child and transformed it into a piece of jewelry like only a real icon can. (Meanwhile, when I tried to accessorize with my Slinky in the first grade, nobody called me iconic, but whatever.)  Taking a break from her 'On The Run II' tour, the Lemonade singer stepped out in New York wearing a suited up look that she accessorized with gold Slinky-inspired earrings by Y/Project. Along with the playful jewelry, she also accessorized with a hot pink bag (that could potentially double as a giant flask), tortoise sunglasses, and a sky-high braided half ponytail.    The Y/Project earrings, which retail for $300, are still available to shop online. Unless, of course, you want to DIY the look with an actual Slinky, which is a steal at $2.75.   Y/Project earrings, $300, ssense.com. SHOP NOW This is not exactly how Back to The Future envisioned the 2010s, but who needs flying cars when you have Beyonc√© wearing Slinkys as earrings? Welcome to the real future, baby, Beyonc√© will let us know which toy to wear next. 
 You can buy the stylishly cute pair at Maisonette after the show...  A quick perusal through your Instagram feed is convincing enough‚Äîit's a mommy and me world and we're just living in it. As stylish girls become women, and then become mothers, it just makes sense that they would outfit their mini me's in fashions befitting their well-honed aesthetics. Children's e-commerce site Maisonette built their foundation on the concept. Now, they're getting into the high fashion mommy and me business with the second launch of their collaboration with Brock Collection, launching on the site today and showing on the brand's New York Fashion Week show this morning.  "Laura and Kris are old friends, and we have been champions of theirs since our Vogue days. We're such fans of the Brock aesthetic, which lends itself so beautifully to kids' clothing," Sylvana Ward Durrett, founder of Maisonette tells BAZAAR.com, "From launching our first collection last Spring to debuting our Fall assortment today, our collaboration is so special and has brought us so much joy, especially as we see the overwhelming  response from our collective customer." The collection consists of a pencil skirt and cropped blouse and cocktail dress for women, in a matching blush floral print with a tiered dress for the little ones.  "We work very collaboratively, and came up with the designs together," co-founder Luisana Mendoza says, "We wanted to launch this collaboration alongside a runway show so mothers can have various dressing options to match with her little.  It‚Äôs our favorite children's dress yet." Brock's designers and founders weigh in on the feminine, and very cute collection below. What is the inspiration behind the assortment? Laura Brock: The Children‚Äôs dress was done in a floral pink embossed jacquard, an antique floral we found in one of our favorite mills outside of Paris.  It is actually an interior fabric that we fell in love with in the archives.  You will see it in our Fall Runway collection, and we thought it would be the perfect floral for a little girl. The Brock Woman is a working mother, and while she would love to match her daughter, she may not necessarily want the exact same shape of dress as her daughter - so we made the woman dress more pretty- and the child‚Äôs dress more girly!  Why did you want to include a little girls look for your fall collection? Kristopher Brock: Maisonette is the perfect partner for Brock‚Äîwe work very collaboratively together and always come up with our collections and ideas as a team.  Fall was the perfect time to launch this little girls dress because all the florals in the ready-to-wear collection compliment this one quite nicely.  Mommas can choose any dress of this collection, and pair it back to our Maisonette little girls dress, and they will work perfectly together!  What has made Maisonette a great fit to partner with?  Laura Brock: We've had lots of requests from customers for matching children's clothes, and when Maisonette approached us with the idea, we were thrilled!  We work very collaboratively, and came up with the designs together. 
 From big names like Oscar de la Renta to newcomers like Brock... New York Fashion Week Fall 2018 saw a lot of exits and swan songs, small, intimate presentations and big buck productions‚Äîbut we're getting down to the fashion. See the ten best looks of the season, from Carolina Herrera to Calvin Klein. The American Stock Exchange was a hot spot at NYFW, but Raf Simons approach for Calvin Klein was less sleek Milanese dinner party and more creepy rural Americana farmscape on a bed of popcorn. The designer emphasized that this collection thought was about, "hope," not the apocalypse. Pretty prairie dresses done up in sheer fabric help drive that idea home.  Bottega Veneta brought the elegance of Milan to the runway of New York City‚Äîand the New York Stock Exchange in particular. The best looks were all rich boudoir, like this sunshine yellow textural gown with bra detail showing through. It's sensual without being overt‚ÄîTomas Maier at his most refined. Wang's swan song to NYFW took place at the old Conde Nast building amidst flickering florescent lights and standard gray office cubicle walls‚Äîbut the looks were all modernized "Working Girl"and the most polished the designer has been in seasons‚Äîthis white fur tux jacket dress was a standout. Brock designers Kristopher Brock and Laura Vassar have made a duo name for themselves in denim and ultra-feminine dressing‚Äîmelding the two perfectly for Fall 2018 in this chic update on a house coat paried with kicky flared dark jeans. Laura Kim and Fernando Garcia delved into the Oscar archives and embraced the label's identity as a house of gowns this season more than ever before‚Äîbringing home the idea with unabashedly pretty strapless dresses with billowing skirts with utterly whimsical prints. Oscar nominees will be lining up at the atelier. Carolina Herrera handed Wes Gordon the reigns of her empire as he handed her a bouquet fit for a queen. First, though Herrera showed a fantasyland of stunning gowns including this '80s inspired red off-the-shoulder dress that shows the always-regal designer's affinity for a little drama and a lot of class.  Never accuse Jacobs of lacking a knack for theatre. The New York native went all-80s-all-the-way, effectively convincing a crowd of runway-worn fashion folk that the future is all about the past for the last show of the week. A black patent trench with exaggerated shoulders wasn't the most over-the-top look of the lot, but it sold the idea that this much drama is right on time.  Kors had a little something for everyone at his Fall 2018 show‚Äîfrom ball gowns to plaid suiting and a leopard coat. This leather trench and flares is part of Kors calling card of exacting basics worth collecting. Those shopping bags might just have been some subliminal messaging to customers to get their cc's ready.  Maxwell showed a collection that was all about casual elegance for Fall 2018‚Äîcomplete with models spinning in perfect Pat Cleveland style. This finale look of a hoodie on an embroidered ball gown skirt, worn by Gigi Hadid drove the idea home.  The restrained beauty of the Isamu Noguchi sculptures on the runway at The Row is the perfect metaphor for the label's understated, beautifully executed looks. This flowing white top and drop-waist maxi skirt with just the right sheerness drives the idea home that luxury lives in just the right fabric, just the right pleat, just the right length and just the right details. 
 She looks radiant. Kate Middleton continues to perform her royal public duties, as she nears the birth of her third child with husband Prince William.  Celebrating St. Patrick's Day 2018, the Duchess wore a chic emerald green outfit, and simple black velvet pumps. She held her baby bump often, as she made her annual trip with Prince William to honor the Irish Guards for St. Patrick's Day, at Cavalry Barracks in Hounslow, England. Middleton looked ecstatic to be taking part in the engagement, and seemed happy to celebrating St. Patrick's Day with the guards. Her color co-ordinated outfit was perfect for the occasion, and was another example of the Duchess' pitch perfect maternity wardrobe: Prince William seemed to be enjoying the day immensely too, even partaking in what looked like a pint of Guinness, but might just have been a glass of cold brew coffee (judging by the Starbucks sign behind him): Plus, an Irish wolfhound called Domhnall was on hand to make the day even cuter: The Duchess of Cambridge is due to go on maternity leave soon, with her baby due sometime next month. But the gorgeous photos of her make it clear that she loves celebrating St. Patrick's Day: A very happy #StPatricksDay to the Irish Guards, and all our followers‚òòÔ∏è pic.twitter.com/9ss3UHdbMf Prince William and Middleton's third baby is due in April. They made the announcement about their due date back in October 2017, prior to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's engagement announcement.  The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are delighted to confirm they are expecting a baby in April 2018. pic.twitter.com/jOzB1TJMof The baby's birthday could fall very close to great grandmother Queen Elizabeth II's, as she was born on April 21. 
 The creative director announces his plans to exit the streetwear brand he cofounded.  Five years after cofounding Vetements and sparking the luxury streetwear movement, Demna Gvasalia is stepping down as head designer of the brand. The news was announced in a statement to WWD over the weekend.  "Vetements has always been a collective of creative minds. We will continue to push the boundaries even further, respecting codes and the authentic values of the brand, and keep on supporting honest creativity and genuine talent," Guram Gvasalia, cofounder and chief executive officer of Vetements, told WWD. "What Demna has accomplished over the past few years represents a key chapter in the story of Vetements. We are very grateful to Demna for having contributed to the great momentum of the house." Demna's vision at Vetements ushered in a new era of luxury streetwear‚Äîone that remains impactful to this day. Over the years, the Georgian designer made a splash with many of his collections at Vetements‚Äîincluding DHL T-shirts, $800 sweatshirts that read phrases like "May the bridges I burn light the way" or simply "You Fuck'n Asshole," and even a runway show at McDonald's.  His success at Vetements ultimately led to him being appointed artistic director at Balenciaga in 2016. Demna will reportedly continue in his role at Balenciaga, though the Vetements statement also said he was stepping down  "to pursue new ventures." "I started Vetements because I was bored of fashion and against all odds fashion did change once and forever since Vetements appeared and it also opened a new door for so many. So I feel that I have accomplished my mission of a conceptualist and design innovator at this exceptional brand and Vetements has matured into a company that can evolve its creative heritage into a new chapter on its own," he told WWD in a statement.
 A capsule collection of red-soled booties has arrived. The day has finally come: Louboutin's baby shoes are back. Christian Louboutin made waves last year when, in collaboration with Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop, the signature red soled shoes were first released in mini form. Now, a limited-edition capsule collection has made them available once again. Anyone with a child between 6 and 9 months (or entering that window soon) should snap these up quick‚Äîthere's no telling when, or if, they'll be on sale again. And with only 600 in stock, they're sure to go fast.   "I love the idea of transposing the proportions of women‚Äôs shoe detailing onto a baby shoe," Louboutin said. "That‚Äôs how I worked on the bow pattern. I wanted to give it a Walt Disney cartoon‚Äìtype look which parents, including myself, usually fall in love with." The shoes come in three colors: a bold red, which blends seamlessly into the iconic sole, and two graphic takes on the brand's upcoming Loubigraf collection, which was inspired by graffiti. Now that the miniature version is on sale, Louboutin devotees can achieve ultimate mommy-and-me status. If you're worried these booties are just a gimmick, don't worry: Louboutin went above and beyond to craft these miniature pairs. It was "a new challenge for our artisans to work on baby shoes, since the techniques are completely different from those you use for a men‚Äôs or women‚Äôs shoe," he said. "We had to work very closely on the craftsmanship but I am very happy with the result." Judging by the success of the first Louboutin baby release, he's not the only one that's pleased to see them.

 The designer styles her go-to piece, three unexpected ways... Maggie Marilyn is like a breath of fresh air, bubbly but approachable, bright, young and pretty, which might be how you describe the New Zealand designer's ready to wear line. Part sporty part smart, the ethically responsible label launched in September 2016 and has become a go-to for girls who like a statement piece with polish. BAZAAR asked Marilyn to choose her hero piece from her recent collection and style it three ways.  "Our 'I'll Stand Beside You Dress' in custom blush stripe  is one of my favorite pieces from our resort collection and this is because it is really so versatile," she explains, "You can dress this piece down with sneakers and a t-shirt to elevate it or wear on its own with a great pair of kitten heel mules. This is a dress you could truly wear three times in one week." Below, Marilyn proves it. "This is my go to look for wearing this dress as it is so easy to wear to work. I have paired it with our Sunkissed t-shirt from Resort and a pair of Stan Smith adidas sneakers." How would you describe your personal style? I love contrasting elements in an outfit, a silk satin slip dress paired with sneakers or a slip dress with a t-shirt underneath. I love pairing elevated pieces with casual everyday accessories. I also like having a mixture of masculine boyish charm, with strong feminine details.  How is your style reflected in your brand? I think this is reflected in the brand's easy and optimistic approach. I describe the brand as 'livable luxury'. Beautiful pieces made with luxurious fabrics that can be worn everyday, they are designed to be lived in... "I paired the dress with a sash and bright fuchsia Manolo Blahnik mules. This is the perfect outfit for afterwork drinks and dinner." Why did you want to launch Maggie Marilyn? As cliche as it sounds, I was designing for a gap in the market which  my sisters, friends, mum and myself felt wasn't catered to. Clothing that was aspirational but wearable, luxurious but affordable, modern and current yet timeless and ethically, sustainably conscious.  What was your vision for it? My vision was and still is, to make beautiful clothes that not only empower our wearer to conquer her world but to empower the people involved in our supply chain, to enrich their lives as well. "I wore our I'll Stand Beside You Dress tucked into our Game Changer pants to act as a cami with the detachable sash removed for a more casual look. I kept the shoes simple, just black Manolo Blahnik kitten heel mules. This is a look pared back enough for Saturday brunch that can take you right through to Saturday night drinks." How would you describe the aesthetic of Maggie Marilyn? Optimistic, playful, feminine, empowering and freeing.  You include sporty elements in much of the design, what‚Äôs the thought behind that? I think this really relates back to the juxtaposition between the elevated and casual everyday aesthetic of the brand. it's also what we all wear now, its simplicity, which is a luxury in and of itself.

 The 47-year-old model and entrepreneur exudes effortless beauty. From walking every major runway in the '90s, to recently making an epic return on the catwalk at Versace's tribute show to Gianni, Claudia Schiffer has solidified her status as a supermodel for the ages. Now with a makeup line of products that highlight natural beauty and a love for '70s fashion, Schiffer opens up about some of her favorite things and how she maintains her ageless style.  Karl Lagerfeld told me when I was starting out that I should just be myself and not worry about what anyone else wanted me to be. Throughout my career I‚Äôve remembered his advice and trusted my instincts.  After 30 years of being fortunate enough to model some of the most beautiful clothes, I‚Äôve really learned what suits me.

 The 53-year-old legendary bombshell revisits the unforgettable night‚Äîand the iconic Versace gown‚Äîthat forever altered her life. Twenty-five years ago, a friend of mine invited me to the London premiere of a low-budget movie he had produced that was generating a bit of buzz. The film, Four Weddings and a Funeral, starred Andie MacDowell and Hugh Grant. At the after-party, which took place at a crumbling building in Piccadilly, a stone‚Äôs throw from Buckingham Palace, the excitement over the release was quickly eclipsed by the scandalous appearance of Grant‚Äôs girlfriend, a little-known actress who had shown up in a black stretch-silk Versace dress so revealing that it only just managed to conceal her impressive breasts. It was slit to her upper thigh, and‚Äîmost memorably‚Äîheld together by large gold safety pins. Elizabeth Hurley had arrived on the scene. ‚ÄúI was so unprepared for what happened that night,‚Äù recalls Hurley, who at 53 looks almost unchanged. ‚ÄúI urgently needed to find a dress to wear for Hugh‚Äôs premiere, and in those days I had no idea about fashion.‚Äù Hurley was given the number of a PR agency that had offered to lend her something. ‚ÄúI remember going to an office where they literally fished a dress out of a white plastic bag,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI took it home and did my own hair and makeup, fighting Hugh for the mirror, which wasn‚Äôt even full-length, in our tiny one-bedroom flat. It was all very unglamorous compared to how things get done these days.‚Äù ‚ÄúI was so unprepared for what happened that night.‚Äù It was hardly an auspicious start for the moment that would propel Hurley into the global media spotlight. At a time when red-carpet dressing was dominated by the elegant restraint of designers like Giorgio Armani, in the flash of a camera bulb Liz Hurley single-handedly showed a whole other purpose for getting glam: red carpet as career move. ‚ÄúGianni made that dress for a woman who is sure of herself and who isn‚Äôt afraid to break the rules,‚Äù Donatella Versace says of her late brother. ‚ÄúLiz embodied all of this in an extraordinary way.‚Äù  Afterward Hurley‚Äôs life changed rapidly. She acknowledges her debt to that dress, both for the doors it opened‚Äîwithin a year she became the face of Est√©e Lauder (she currently serves as the global ambassador for the brand‚Äôs breast cancer campaign)‚Äîand for the friendship it began with the Versaces.  And now the infamous dress that started it all has been reimagined by Versace, and Liz is back in it (enviably, she claims the original dress would also still fit). ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt exercise, but I am very active,‚Äù she says (as demonstrated by the Instagram photos of Hurley wearing her namesake swimwear line). ‚ÄúBut just because it still fits doesn‚Äôt mean I would wear it today‚Äîit wouldn‚Äôt be appropriate!‚Äù The new version is ‚Äúmore demure,‚Äù she adds. This time around, her breasts are safely tucked behind fabric that crosses over her bosom rather than below it. There is a long sleeve on one side, and the safety pins hold together a discreet slash that runs across her toned stomach.  ‚ÄúGianni made that dress for a woman who is sure of herself and who isn‚Äôt afraid to break the rules.‚Äù So how did it feel to reconnect with that life-altering moment? ‚ÄúLike a time revisited with affection,‚Äù she replies. ‚ÄúBack then I didn‚Äôt think too deeply about anything. I followed my jobs with a Samsonite suitcase, shoot to shoot, movie to movie.‚Äù These days, she enjoys the blissful domesticity of gardening on her estate in Herefordshire (‚ÄúI love getting muddy and hacking down things with my chain saw!‚Äù) and relaxing with friends like Elton John and Valentino Garavani. In recent years, she has continued to titillate audiences, starring as the sexy and morally questionable Queen Helena of England on E!‚Äôs drama The Royals. ‚ÄúI had a great time working on that show,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI got to kiss a lot of young men in their 20s!‚Äù As for future roles, she notes, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hoping to break with the femme fatale casting and play a lesbian in my next film.‚Äù Roles or not, one thing is for sure: Hurley still knows how to get tongues wagging.

 The 17-year-old model shares what it was like working with the legendary designer on her first collection.  It's the last day of New York Fashion Week and despite having walked an impressive lineup of shows, Kaia Gerber is full of energy and enthusiasm, ready to talk about another big milestone in her career: her first collection, designed in collaboration with Karl Lagerfeld, no less.  At 17 years old, the supermodel-in-the-making's first foray into design comes just one year after making her runway debut, but with Karl as her teacher, she's managed to learn a lot her first time around. "In this particular field, there aren‚Äôt many people who know as much as Karl knows about design. So learning from somebody like that, I really couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better experience," Kaia gushes. The end result was the Karl x Kaia collection, a streamlined range of pieces that manage to perfectly blend the model's West Coast upbringing with the designer's Parisian roots. "We really wanted to have both our worlds meet and both of our personal styles come together," the model explains.  But before the collaboration came to be, she wasn't always so at ease working with the legendary designer. "I first met him at a Fendi fitting a year ago," Kaia recalls, "It was my first season doing shows and I didn‚Äôt know that he was going to be at the fittings because seeing how much of an icon he was, I was like ‚Äòthere‚Äôs no way he‚Äôs actually that involved!‚Äô So I show up and walk out in my look and immediately see Karl in front of me and I was like [gasps]. It just immediately took my breath away. He said ‚ÄòHi Kaia,‚Äô and I was like ‚ÄòMe?!‚Äô I was looking around like, 'is there someone else named Kaia here?! He can‚Äôt be talking to me, oh my god!'"   It‚Äôs official: KARL LAGERFELD will introduce an exclusive collection designed with model-of-the moment @kaiagerber, launching August 30. Comment below if you're excited! #KARLXKAIA A post shared by  KARL LAGERFELD (@karllagerfeld) on Aug 20, 2018 at 12:01am PDT Fast forward to a year later and both Kaia and Karl have been transformed into little cartoon balloons spotted all over the streets of SoHo, where the model celebrated the collection's launch during NYFW. "It's so crazy," Kaia reflects, looking up at the balloons that fill her hotel room. "I‚Äôve always loved fashion, but personally I just wanted to be comfortable and growing up I was always a tomboy, so I never thought people would look up to what I was wearing. And to be able to actually design something? It‚Äôs just been really cool." Of course, it's hard not to bring up Kaia's mother, Cindy Crawford, in all of this. When I ask whether her supermodel mom has inspired her style, she credits the outcome of the collection partially to Cindy's influence: ‚ÄúMy mom has always focused on the classics of style and I think she passed that onto me, where less is more. Karl also does an amazing job of not letting the clothes overshadow the woman, so with this collection we really wanted to focus on the classic pieces like a leather jacket and a little black dress and just things you can wear every day.‚Äù It should be noted, however, that there's much more to Kaia's personal style than comparisons with her famous mom. When I ask who her other style icons are, she warns me with a laugh, "Okay, this is a weird one, but have you ever seen Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas?" I nod, not sure of where she could possibly be going with this, and she excitedly continues, "Okay so Raoul Duke, Johnny Depp's character in it, is my style icon. I‚Äôve always just been so obsessed with his look in the movie. Also David Bowie, I have really random style muses, but those two are mine. They‚Äôre fun and don‚Äôt take it too seriously."  And suddenly I'm reminded that I'm speaking to the coolest teenager, as if her first collection with Karl Lagerfeld wasn't already reminder enough. 
 The brand was a fitting choice. Barack and Michelle Obama unveiled their official portraits, painted by reowned African-American artists Kehinde Wiley and Amy Sherald respectively, at the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery this morning. While Barack's painting stars the former president amidst a colorful wall of foliage, Michelle's is simpler, featuring the former first lady in a geometric printed dress, sitting in repose against a blue-gray backdrop. That dress is by the American brand Milly, helmed by designer Michelle Smith. The look is from the the label's Spring 2017 collection, which hit the runway at New York Fashion Week in September 2016. Obama's free-flowing halter gown is playful and modern, covered in circles, stripes, and triangles in black and gray with touches of pink and yellow in the skirt. The former FLOTUS has long been a fan of the brand. She wore a striped bell sleeve blouse by the designer, paired with black trousers and pumps, for one of her final walks through the White House in 2017:  Thank you for the birthday wishes and for the greatest gift of all: the opportunity to serve as your First Lady. ‚Äìmo A post shared by  Michelle Obama (archived) (@michelleobama44) on Jan 17, 2017 at 6:24pm PST She also sported a pair of wide-leg pants by the brand (with a perfectly edgy cut-out top) during a 2016 appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert: And she wore a white blazer from the label in 2014 while promoting her Drink Up initiative, which encouraged citizens to drink more water: Milly is a fitting choice for Obama's portrait wardrobe, not only because it matches her fresh yet approachable style, but also because the designer is similarly passionate about women's rights and female empowerment. Smith has been a Planned Parenthood supporter for years and even designed a T-shirt to benefit the organization last fall. Her Fall 2017 collection, presented in the wake of the 2016 election, was about rising up from a dark, "fractured" place. Even her Fall 2018 collection, which debuted last week, was inspired by "love, inclusiveness and the desire for equality."
 Katie Sturino of The 12ish Style on the plus-size shopping tricks we should all know.  Since I was old enough to have an interest in clothing, I‚Äôve struggled with finding the right size for my body in stores. From brands not carrying above a size 10 in their stores to the brands who don‚Äôt even make clothing above a size 10, shopping for plus-size fashion can be a frustrating experience. Over the years, I‚Äôve managed to rack up a small arsenal of tips for navigating the fashion world when you‚Äôre not a size 2. Here are some of my best tips and tricks to better shopping for a curvy body type.  Normally when you think of tailoring a garment, you think to size it down‚Äîbut you can also have something tailored up. On a recent trip to Dolce & Gabbana, I fell in love with a skirt but the largest size ended up being a smidgen too tight in the waist. As a solution, they offered to tailor the skirt up for me.  Pardon?! This is a thing? After some research, I discovered that many other luxury retailers, such as Chanel, Etro, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Saint Laurent, and occasionally Prada, offer the same service of letting garments out to make them bigger or adding fabric and elastic to accommodate the shopper's size. Don't be afraid to ask!   I shop for shoes in the men‚Äôs dept quite often...I have a wide size 12 foot and there are so many luxury brands making chic men‚Äôs shoes! More info on @shoesofnyc And yes I am twinning with @muppetsrevenge A post shared by  Katie Sturino (@the12ishstyle) on Feb 16, 2018 at 6:43am PST Shopping in the men‚Äôs department has allowed me to access labels I haven‚Äôt been able to previously wear due to sizing. There are a lot of unisex-friendly options from brands like Ralph Lauren Polo (I live in my Teddy Bear Sweater), IRO, and BLK Denim (because every girl needs a leather jacket) that make similar styles for men and women. My latest purchase is a striped top from the brand Kule which fit me best in a men‚Äôs XL! Ralph Lauren sweater, $395, ralphlauren.com SHOP NOW  Anyone else have trouble finding hats that don‚Äôt make you a pinhead? I rounded up my faves for @instylemagazine A post shared by  Katie Sturino (@the12ishstyle) on Dec 14, 2017 at 8:56am PST The boys pull through with shoes too! My big seasonal shoe purchase typically takes place in the mens department at Barneys. I have a size 12 wide foot and finding a strappy heel can be next to impossible most of the time. Luckily, I'm more of a sneakers gal and men's sneakers are having a moment these days. They're making all the bright and colorful women's sneakers for men, too (see here and here) which often works better for my size needs. The same trick works for boots too, like these Saint Laurent ones. Saint Laurent boots, $1,045, barneys.com. SHOP NOW  Which one is marrying Harry amiright??

Now, we‚Äôre living in an era of seemingly endless jeans options for all sizes, so it's easier than ever to find a brand that best suits your body type. Some of my favorites are Good American (pro-tip: I size up in any of the styles for added stretch), Warp + Weft, AYR, NYDJ, and Marina Rinaldi. A Canadian tuxedo is made for all bodies!  Not all curvy girls like high rise bikini bottoms and not all skinny girls want to rock a dental floss style suit. Whatever you wear on the beach this summer, make sure you are wearing it for you ‚ù§Ô∏è Suit by @bruna.malucelli A post shared by  Katie Sturino (@the12ishstyle) on May 16, 2018 at 2:11pm PDT Plus-size swimsuits are tricky because brands automatically assume that if you're not a size 2, you want to wear an all black suit (which I don‚Äôt) and that bikinis need to have high-waisted bottoms that go up to your neck.  One of my favorite go-to swim picks is this Pucci string bikini that goes up to a size 14 but can be tied looser on a larger frame. Cynthia Rowley is making suits for Coedition, a new multi-brand plus retailer and I love the edgy collaborations that Ashley Graham and Gabi Gregg have done for Swimsuits for All.   ‚ùå‚ÄúWear all black workout clothes, it‚Äôs more flattering‚Äù ‚ùå‚ÄúOnly rock a sports bra only top if you have a flat stomach‚Äù ‚ùå ‚ÄúWhite pants show cellulite‚Äù ‚úÖ ‚ÄúWear whatever the F you want!‚Äù‚úÖ A post shared by  Katie Sturino (@the12ishstyle) on Apr 6, 2018 at 12:33pm PDT Allow modifications to make an accessory work for your body.

 This runway show was simply mesmerizing.   What says Paris Fashion Week better than a flurry of dresses gliding down from the ceiling and sliding onto the bodies of waiting models? Japanese brand Issey Miyake is already known for its cutting-edge innovations in fashion, but now the label has also taken fashion shows to otherworldly levels. Displaying its 2020 Spring/Summer collection during its Paris Fashion Week show, dresses floated down onto models wearing skin-colored undergarments, clothing them in one swift motion. Insider also reported that the brand used pulley systems in order to pull off the surreal effect. Think Alice in Wonderland meets luxury. Don't believe us? See for yourself.  Wow, @isseymiyakeusa this is art. #pfw (via: @kristenvbateman & @mathiasrosenzweig) A post shared by  Paper Magazine (@papermagazine) on Sep 27, 2019 at 8:04am PDT  ‚ÄúEverybody dance now‚Äù üíÉüíÉüíÉ The final of #isseymiyake Spring‚Äô20  @isseymiyakeusa A post shared by  Fashion Inspiration (@catwalkhautecouture) on Sep 27, 2019 at 8:16am PDT After the models successfully got dressed via pulley systems, the music abruptly changed from an ethereal cathedral/electronic mix to a pop instrumental, which the models began jumping up and down to in order to show off just how bouncy the latest Issey Miyake creations are. In another video, performers continued to defy physics, twirling on one foot while seemingly being propped up by thin strings. Some models even whizzed by on skateboards.  The enchanting show and the Spring/Summer 2020 collection was the first for Satoshi Kondo, the new head designer of the Japanese brand. Kondo succeeded Yoshiyuki Miyamae, Issey Miyake's prior creative head, according to Business of Fashion.

 This year's "Camp: Notes on Fashion" theme is sure to deliver a bout of wild, over-the-top red carpet moments.  The 2018 "Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and The Catholic Imagination" Met Gala may have blessed us with Rihanna dressed as a high fashion pope, but the theme for this year's Met Gala is bound to deliver even more over-the-top fashion moments. Consider the below your guide on everything to know ahead of this year's "Camp: Notes On Fashion" gala on Monday, May 6.    Expect to see a truly outrageous and over-the-top red carpet this year. The theme of the Met's 2019 Costume Exhibition is ‚ÄúCamp: Notes on Fashion.‚Äù No, not camp as in sleeping bags and tents, but camp as in exaggerated fashion. The exhibit is inspired by Susan Sontag's 1964 essay that defines camp as "love of the unnatural: of artifice and exaggeration."   Camp fashion can be humorous, ironic, or simply extreme in its nature, meaning you can already expect Lady Gaga and Rihanna to slay this year's red carpet.  Fittingly, the gala will be co-hosted by two campy fashion aficionados: Lady Gaga and Harry Styles. Even more fitting, the entire 2019 event is being sponsored by Gucci. Gucci's Alessandro Michele along with tennis icon Serena Williams will also be joining the two pop stars as co-chairs of the 2019 gala.  Featuring both men's and womenswear, the Met's "Camp: Notes on Fashion" exhibition will feature over 200 pieces of fashion, along with sculptures, paintings, and drawings from the 17th century through today. The works of designers from Virgil Abloh to Alexander McQueen, John Galliano, Rei Kawakubo, Mugler, Bob Mackie, Karl Lagerfeld, and more will be featured in the exhibit. Fresh off the Couture Week runways, the Viktor & Rolf slogan couture gowns that sparked an endless stream of memes will also be on display.  A large part of the exhibition will explore how irony, humor, parody, theatricality, and exaggeration are expressed in fashion. Other sections will highlight Versailles along with queer subcultures of Europe and America dating back to the 19th and early 20th centuries. ‚ÄúWe are going through an extreme camp moment, and it felt very relevant to the cultural conversation to look at what is often dismissed as empty frivolity but can be actually a very sophisticated and powerful political tool, especially for marginalized cultures,‚Äù Andrew Bolton, Costume Institute curator, told the Times. ‚ÄúWhether it‚Äôs pop camp, queer camp, high camp or political camp ‚Äî Trump is a very camp figure ‚Äî I think it‚Äôs very timely.‚Äù  The Hollywood Reporter revealed a first look at the high-profile committee for this year‚Äôs Met Gala, giving us an idea of who‚Äôll attend the celebrated f√™te this year. Big Hollywood names include: Bradley Cooper, Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds, Chadwick Boseman, Lupita Nyong‚Äôo, Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez, and Lena Waithe. Designers include: Tom Ford, Donatella Versace, Miuccia Prada, Pierpaolo Piccioli of Valentino, Clare Waight Keller of Givenchy, and Bob Mackie.  There are also philanthropists in the 183-person committee, like Annette de la Renta, Wendi Murdoch, and Sean and Alexandra Parker. Athletes like Venus Williams, Cam Newton, and Nnamdi Asomugha, who‚Äôll attend with wife Kerry Washington, are also in the mix.  The 2019 Met Gala will take place on Monday, May 6, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.

 And her baby bump looks gorgeous.  Lily Aldridge is five months pregnant right now, but that's not going to stop her from walking in New York Fashion Week.  Aldridge officially announced her second pregnancy at the end of August 2018. Taking to Instagram, the model shared the happy news along with a photo of her baby bump in a bikini. Fans of Aldridge wondered if her news meant that she wouldn't be walking in the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show in November, but if Aldridge's New York Fashion Week appearance is anything to go by, the model isn't stopping work anytime soon. Taking to the runway for Brandon Maxwell this weekend, Aldridge looked effortlessly chic in a red dress, which perfectly accentuated her baby bump.  The Victoria's Secret Angel celebrated the momentous occasion on Instagram, describing how empowering it was to walk the runway while pregnant:  So proud to walk the @brandonmaxwell runway pregnant! I‚Äôve walked a few runways in my life and this is a moment that I‚Äôll look back on forever with great emotion ‚ù§Ô∏è Thank you Brandon for letting my shine & being such a true gentleman, Love you FOREVER!!!

 Look out for Les Girls Les Boys. The founder of ultra-sexy (and sometimes racy) lingerie brand Agent Provocateur is moving on to something less kinky and more progressive: a gender-fluid underwear line. Serena Rees, who established Provocateur in 1994 (and eventually sold it off a decade ago), is launching Les Girls Les Boys‚Äîa lingerie label featuring intimates, underwear, and streetwear that isn't confined to one gender. The brand launches on September 1 with a debut collection of 100 pieces. The aesthetic is much more toned down than Agent Provocateur's, ditching pasties, lace bodices, and BDSM-esque straps for minimalist designs inspired by streetwear (hence, an appeal to millennials). There are graphic tees, comfy-looking sports bras and bodysuits, and sweats. Perhaps most notable are the "bed to street" cotton briefs with logo garter bands √† la Calvin Klein, which one could easily picture taking over Instagram or peeking out from people's jeans in street style snaps.   Rees started working on Les Girls Les Boys about 18 months ago after noticing the "disconnect" between oversexualized concepts of lingerie and how young people now view sex and sexuality. "Victoria‚Äôs Secret and Agent Provocateur are just not relevant to them anymore," Rees told the The New York Times. The affordable price range ($25 to $143) doesn't hurt, either.   "The last decade has seen the rise of totally unobtainable and hypersexualized body images, particularly for women, fueled by the era of internet, social media and plastic surgery," Rees added. "It is wrong and it is worrying because it makes people so unhappy and insecure. In a weird way, I feel a little responsible for it." Les Girls Les Boys pieces will be available to shop lesgirlslesboys.com starting Sept. 1, and stores like Nordstrom and Selfridges.   
 The standout looks from the week's top collections.  As the Spring 2019 collections unfold at New York Fashion Week, we're spotlighting the top five runway looks from all the standout shows. Consider it your sneak peek at the looks that will define the upcoming season. Marc Jacobs started his Spring 2019 runway procession an hour and  a half after go-time, but for those who waited it out, the riches were plenty. Sometimes Guido Palau's hair matched the cotton candy colored confections‚Äîclothes with feathers, frills, tulle and bows that built upon last season's '80 volume, mixed with a vibe that was decidedly Jackie- O.-circa-Camelot on a light hallucinogenic.  The results were artful, playful, surprising‚Äîthe reason we're still willing to wait it out for Marc and the magic only he can bring to the City of Dreams. -Kerry Pieri Just as the fashion set was forced to dash from their European beaches‚Äîand their steady stream of seaside Insta posts‚ÄîMichael Kors brought them back. The theme for Spring 2019 is ‚Äúglobal getaway‚Äù‚Äîwith a mix of Baja knits, brocade, stripes, polka dots, fringe, florals, laser-cut leather and an ‚ÄúEndless Summer‚Äù sweater done up in shades of watermelon, turquoise, lemon, persimmon and lime. Denim and polka dots also made an appearance alongside espadrilles and fringe bags and hats, so many hats. And of them are primed for next season‚Äôs vacation ‚Äògrams‚Äîfloppy hats, knit caps, bucket hats, head scarves, a swim cap! Get your cameras ready.  -Kerry Pieri And so Raf Simon's riff on all things American continues. The designer has been at the helm of Calvin Klein since Fall 2017, and his first seasons took cues from Westerns, cementing Simons' look for the brand. Then, he turned to collegiate logos and athleticism for Resort, and he's tapped into classic films "JAWS" and "The Graduate" for his latest showing. Wetsuits, wet hair, tank tops, half-off dresses, and rubber add-ons were paired with prim, Mrs. Robinson-worthy dresses and graduation caps on the runway for a theatrical presentation that was comprised of both extremely wearable (see: the killer outerwear, trousers, and shoes) and the on-the-nose, cheekier pieces that drove home Simons inspiration. One thing is for sure, this season of 205W39NYC will undoubtedly result in coats, boots, and bags we'll be filling our carts with. ‚Äì Carrie Goldberg Spring 2019 for creative director Stuart Vevers was all about festival dressing‚Äìon his terms. Whether you're packing for Coachella, Burning Man, a trip to Austin or Marfa, or in Vevers case, Sante Fe, this is the wardrobe you should be packing to hang with the cool kids. Feminine and frilly dresses aside, Vevers included cheeky touches like upside-down prints of Disney characters on hoodies and graphic tees and included leather and bomber toppers for added badassery. Keep an eye out for the season's leather goods as well‚Äìthey are, after all, the specialty of this house. ‚Äì Carrie Goldberg Inspired by a sci-fi comic that focuses on a dystopian take on the American West, East of West, LaPointe aimed to deconstruct American classics for Spring 2019‚Äì and keep in mind some of her biggest fans, Gigi and Kendall, in the process. Known for her cool-girl separates and textural plays, Spring 2019 for LaPointe is all about denim, trenches, the working girl pencil skirt, oxford shirting, and more‚Äìeither turned on their ears or with a futuristic edge. Per her past seasons and an au courant way of dressing, this season showcased completely monochromatic looks that we expect to see fashion's favorite it-girls sporting on the street. ‚Äì Carrie Goldberg Gabriela Hearst is a master of closet essentials, but in elevated ways. Think of her pieces as riffs on high-end basics we didn't know we absolutely could not live without, until now. This season, her signature color palette of neutrals, indigos, and soft pinks was capped off with embellishments, artful pleating, and tailoring we want to wear for everything from the office to black tie. As if that weren't enough to want/need/die for, we're going to need her mini bags in our closets come spring as well‚Äìor ASAP. ‚Äì Carrie Goldberg 
 So fun, you‚Äôll be tempted to stay out all night. A fresh wave of designers are reinventing the concept of dressing up, and Saks is championing them all. Gone are the boring LBDs, going-out tops, and stuffy formal gowns, and in their place come a new slew of fun, edgy-yet-glamorous dresses and jumpsuits that'll really make you want to party.  The cool young things designing it all‚Äîlike Alessandra Rich (a major fave of British socialites), Alexandre Vauthier, and Attico‚Äîare creating pieces that are bursting with color, embellishments, and prints.  And best of all, everything is made to dance in‚Äîso much so that you just might be tempted to stay out until the early hours of the morning.  Shown above: Alessandra Rich dress, $1,790, saks.com; Oscar de la Renta earrings, $490, saks.com; Alexander Wang bag, $1,295, saks.com; Alexandre Vauthier dress, $3,230, saks.com; Judith Leiber bag, $5,495, saks.com, Attico boots, $1,045, saks.com Breakfast at Saks The classic black gown Holly Golightly sported after having a night out on the town is an undeniably iconic moment, but today's modern girl is all about making a statement. Sara Battaglia‚Äôs sequin-ruched ankle-grazing dress does all the talking here, meaning minimal accessories are required. This silk one-shoulder jumpsuit has a casual and charmingly playful element to it (i.e. an elasticized waist tie) that can easily translate from night to day. Soon, rocking a full-on mashup of color and pattern will feel just as simple as throwing on a T-shirt. Sara Battaglia dress, $2,545, saks.com; Attico bag, $351, saks.com;  Katkim ear pin, $700, saks.com; Johanna Ortiz jumpsuit, $1,750, saks.com; Linda Farrow sunglasses (similar), $540, saks.com Coffee Run Color is the name of the game. A pink Magda Butrym dress checks all the best-of-the-'80s boxes: potent prints, ruching, a nipped-in waist, and legs for days. Not to mention statement shoulders that are much sleeker and less fussy than their predecessors. An all-velvet Attico gown is the perfect solve to a "what do I wear?" situation. And because of its uber chicness, you can get away with minimal thought elsewhere; ballet flats look just as appropriate as heels do when worn against a bold, plush fabric.   Magda Butrym dress, $1,825, saks.com; Oscar de la Renta brooch, $265, saks.com; Kenneth Jay Lane earrings, $100, saks.com; Attico bag, $216, saks.com; Loeffler Randall heels, $375, saks.com; Attico dress, $1,766 saks.com, Attico slides, $650, saks.com; Sydney Evan earrings, $5,305, saks.com Garden Party Attico's dual designers Giorgia Tordini and Gilda Ambrosio have brought us back to the days when dressing-up was a joy and less a chore (look to their personal style for some extra inspiration). Take their blooming motif  into the new season with a tie-shoulder and liquid velvet slip. It's a romantic, glamorous look for the modern-day woman, and proof that florals can be a year-round pattern. Colombian fiesta touches toughen up Johanna Ortiz‚Äôs romantic aesthetic for fall, and this feminine ruffle number with balloon-sleeve magic makes it an effortless choice for any occasion.  Johanna Ortiz dress, $2,500, saks.com; Illesteva sunglasses, $230, saks.com; Edie Parker bag, $750, saks.com; Rene Caovilla shoes, $1,095, saks.com; Attico dress, $945, saks.com, Nancy Gonzalez bag, $3,750, saks.com, Manolo Blahnik heels, $645, saks.com City Limits We can all agree that the spaghetti strap is nothing groundbreaking, but this iteration is plenty noteworthy, with embellishments, deep slits, and lots of sequins.  The trick when looking for a different type of dress is to keep an eye out for the details. A knotted bodice or cascading ruffle trim give sparkles a casual-cool effect. Keep accessories simple for that on-the-go attitude. Instead of an oversized tote, opt for a clutch or top-handle bag for easy mobility.  Alessandra Rich dress, $1,925, saks.com; Alexander Wang heels, $995, saks.com; Kenneth Jay Lane earrings, $45, saks.com; Judith Leiber Couture clutch, $3,995, saks.com; Alexandre Vauthier dress, $6,800, saks.com, Jimmy Choo heels, $695, saks.com; Plev√© earrings, $6,795, saks.com; Edie Parker bag, $1,295, saks.com Styled by Allison Bornstein, Hair by Linda Shalabi, Makeup by Mark Edio
 "Desmond is Amazing" is just that. Desmond Is Amazing, a 10-year-old self-proclaimed "drag kid," worked the runway at New York Fashion Week on Sunday, when he strutted down the catwalk at Gypsy Sport's Fall 2018 show. "I FEEL A-MA-ZING!!!," Desmond, whose full name is Desmond Napoles, wrote on Instagram. "I am so thankful for all the opportunities today." According to the native New Yorker and LGBTQ advocate, he is a "drag kid, dragutante, dragketeer, and draganista doing what I like to call kinderdrag üç≠." Desmond told The Daily Beast earlier this month that he began dressing in drag at age 2, when he used to wear his mom's heels around the house and her bed sheets as a wig.  Desmond describes his looks as "androgynously" and his style "avant drag." In Gypsy Sport's show, he wore an oversize black blazer with Elizabethan ruffles around the neckline. His noticeable sense of confidence beamed from the runway, and it seemingly aligns with that of Gypsy Sport designer Rio Uribe who, in a September Vogue profile, was dubbed a "natural-born disruptor." "For [Uribe], thinking outside the traditional bounds of fashion is a way of life," the publication noted.  RuPaul has also given Desmond his stamp of approval. In the video below, the drag queen of all drag queens told Desmond at DragCon 2017 in New York City that he was the "future of America.‚Äù Desmond is also creating a platform and paving the way for other children like him. According to his Instagram, he has created a drag house for drag kids called Haus of Amazing ‚Äî clearly, Gypsy Sport is just the beginning for the young star.

 The iconic Italian brand reinvents a classic.   What's in a logo? A lot if you're an Italian heritage brand like Furla looking to re-evaluate your place in the market. While most brands might search outward for inspiration, Furla looked within the company, and therein found their answer. Furla landed on a symbol the perfect symbol that represented the view of thee company ‚Äîan arch. "There is an arch at the entrance of Fondazione Furla. It's a symbolic point of view. You enter in a new world, enter in Furla world, it's inclusive, Furla loves you," the brand's CEO Alberto Camerlengo tells Bazaar.com during their Milan Fashion Week Spring 2020 presentation.  Starting with the current Spring 2020 collection, you'll find this new logo on Furla's accessories range. The arch symbol serves as the closure on their most well known styles like the pochette, crossbody, saddle bag and beyond. In terms of colors they have something for everyone, whether you lean towards neturals like black or cognac, or a quintesstial spring hue like pink. The Spring 2020 range will also offer up printed accessories with florals and chainlinks. Inclusivity is echoed again as a touchstone for the brand. "The arch is ageless, sexless detail. It's contemporary, it's smart and at the same time very wearable," says Furla President Giovanna Furlanetto. "Our customer is quite young, 20-35, but even teenagers buy our products. It's aimed to fulfill the desire of every target, no matter who you are or your social status. We embrace the widest target."  While embracing a varied customer is important, so is capturing the attention of those customers in the digital age. The importance and the unrelenting pace of the internet is not lost on Furla's leaders.  "We've gone through the process, renewing ourselves according to the years we've been living," explains Furlanetto. "At one point our collection was distributed amongst 46 Saks Fifth Avenue stores in the U.S. It was the good time for department stores, but no that's gone, it's a digital time. The brand accepts that stores are becoming more like showrooms, while customers may browse product in a brick and mortar location, they may end up purchasing online. They've even developed an app in store so that customers can order exactly what they're looking for. "Times have changed and the company has survived 90+ years in a world that is so quickly changing‚Äîit's a miracle. So, we're always reinvesting in our company," says Furlanetto.  Stopped by the @furla presentation, with my personalized bag. Loving their new logo and look! #FurlaIllusions # ad A post shared by  PAOLA ALBERDI (@paolaalberdi) on Sep 20, 2019 at 10:35am PDT They also embrace the digital age and know that the access to customers via social media is invaluable. "Social media is an opportunity to get in touch with our customers. We have 1.6 million Instagram followers and we engage with them as much as we can. We are very happy with our community, and we try to work with them as much as we can. It's a chance to learn what they desire." What's their biggest desire? "Newness," Furla says, and newness is what Furla continues to deliver.  Shop Furla Fall 2019 collection now at furla.com.

 From cool crochet to the return of hot pants, this is your official guide to spring's top trends.  The long parade of more than 100 fashion shows for the spring 2020 season has concluded‚Äîbut we're just getting started. The first order of business is discerning the most impactful trends of the season: from artisanal crochet and graphic polka dots to a look at decades past via disco collars and '60s wallpaper prints, couture feathers, hot pants, bold neons, and many more. See which designers led the pack for each new mode and get in on the looks early by shopping them now. Welcome to what's next. And just like that disco‚Äôs not dead. The wide collar favored by the Studio 54 set made a surprise comeback on the spring 2020 runways. Modernized on coats, jackets, and button-downs at Lanvin, Ferragamo, JW Anderson, and beyond, the look is often shown with contrasting colors to make it really stand out. Because what‚Äôs the point of a super collar if you can‚Äôt really see it? Pictured: Lanvin, Victoria Beckham, Salvatore Ferragamo, Saint Laurent, JW Anderson The look is most impactful in jacket form‚Äîbonus points if it has a contrasting collar as seen on the Paco Rabanne runway.  Ease into the trend with a trench coat that features a strong, pronounced collar‚Äîand can be worn both now and next spring.¬† Crochet is getting a cool update come spring. Think ultra-feminine dresses, polished suiting, and eveningwear that feels modern with a special touch of Grandma‚Äôs handmade crochet. As the fashion industry looks for ways to become more sustainable, there‚Äôs something special about a ‚Äútrend‚Äù that embraces a slow, handmade technique that can be passed down generation after generation‚Äî√† la that treasured family heirloom that lasts forever.  Pictured: Marni, Fendi, Salvatore Ferragamo, Jil Sander, Gabriela Hearst Jonathan Simkhai's delicate midi dress complete with a matching cardigan tied at the waist got the season's crochet trend just right.  Style this crochet cardigan over your favorite slipdress to wear the look now.¬† Who wears short shorts? A lot of us, come next season. Hot pants staged a triumphant comeback on the spring 2020 runways‚Äîfrom itty bitty knit shorts at Herm√®s and Ferragamo to denim cutoffs at Rag & Bone and spandex at Brandon Maxwell. For those who'd rather ease into Daisy Duke status, Chanel styled the look with black tights.  Pictured: Herm√®s, Isabel Marant, Chanel, Saint Laurent, Salvatore Ferragamo, Brandon Maxwell Balance out the ultra-short shorts with long sleeves or a jacket on top, √† la Isabel Marant.  Take inspiration from the Chanel runway and style a pair of black tights under these black short shorts to wear the look now.¬† What‚Äôs fluoro pink, orange, blue, green, and yellow, and refuses to blend in with the crowd? All the highlighter-inspired neons gracing your favorite catwalks, from Tom Ford to Christopher John Rogers, and Courreges. Subtle may not be her specialty, but these vibrant shades pair wonderfully with black, white, or tan, and know how to make an entrance. Pictured: Courreges, Christopher John Rogers, Jacquemus, Marni, Balenciaga Valentino knows this trend is at its best when it's go big or go home. A striking neon maxi dress is one way to make an entrance‚Äîand an exit.  The hue has just as much impact in blazer form with this striking neon green find from Sies Marjan.¬† If the thought of hot pants makes you want to run, Bermuda shorts are here to save the day. Putting a twist on the classic suit, designers from Bottega Veneta to Chloe to Givenchy embraced the Bermuda short suit for spring. Part nine-to-five, part California cool, meet the next wave of the bike short trend.  Pictured: Bottega Veneta, Chloe, Altuzarra, Givenchy, Tod's, Dion Lee Tom Ford offered a more playful take on the Bermuda suit‚Äîopting for a hot pink mismatched-fabric iteration.  Go for a feminine, playful take on the trend with Frankie Shop's pale-pink Bermuda shorts and matching blazer.¬† Crop tops are no longer cutting it‚Äîthe bra top has officially entered the party. From crochet iterations at Dior and Giambattista Valli to a more daring sheer number at Loewe, bikini dressing comes in all textures and styles. Just add a high-waisted skirt and you've got the perfect summer look.  Pictured: Fendi, Dior, Givenchy, Giambattista Valli, Loewe  Make it ultra feminine by styling a ruffle-embellished bra top with a high-waisted midi skirt, as spotted on the Lanvin runway. Two trends in one? Yes, please. Get an early start on the bra-top craze with this crocheted version you can layer under your favorite cardigan to achieve that sought-after Katie Holmes street style look.¬† Last season found us in a sea of flowing tulle, indication that gala gowns were ready to hit the circuit beyond your basic black-tie affair. Expanding on that idea for spring 2020 are lovely and light tiered dresses that manage to offer volume, high drama, and maximum twirl-ability. Oscar de la Renta and Roksanda took the idea pretty in pink, while Preen, McQueen, and Dior went classic in black and white.  Pictured: Molly Goddard, Christopher Kane, Roksanda, Dior, Alexander McQueen Chanel's tiered maxi skirts are surprisingly versatile pieces for spring‚Äîdress them up with the right blouse and shoe, or make them more casual with a bra top and sandals.  Wear it now with your favorite turtleneck and then again next spring with the perfect crop top or T-shirt.¬† We'll spare you the groundbreaking florals this season and instead, look to '60s and '70s wallpaper for your print fix. Retro prints ruled the runways‚Äîbringing both major color and pattern to all the top collections. Serving up mod home decor realness, vintage wallpaper (and couch) prints were channeled in the form of suiting at Prada and Marc Jacobs. Christopher Kane opted for a more psychedelic wallpaper print in the form of spring dresses, while Etro and Alberta Ferretti delivered a more bohemian-print option.  Pictured: Prada, Marc Jacobs, Gucci, Fendi, Etro, Christopher Kane Your grandparents' old kitchen wallpaper, but make it fashion in the form of a flouncy Christopher Kane dress.  A colorful, abstract print dress that captures the playfulness of '60s wallpaper in sartorial form. Just add sandals and go. When it comes to eveningwear, as much as the world is wont to convince you, sometimes a little black dress just won‚Äôt do. Enter: boldly feathered frocks and tops from Burberry, Valentino, Attico, and more. While almost certainly light as air, these ensembles pack a heavy sartorial punch. Pictured: Christopher John Rogers, Prabal Gurung, Burberry, Valentino, Richard Quinn If you don't have a black-tie event to tend to, take note from Attico and give the look a bit of edge by styling a glam feathered top with a cool pair of trousers or jeans.  Ideal for your next night‚Äîoffset the glam feathers with a pair of jeans or a printed pair of pants.¬†¬† While the term borrowed from the boys is so passe in 2019, there is something decidedly last midcentury Savile Row about the vest. Whether included as part of a three-piece suit at Burberry and Etro, or mismatched with a jacket at Louis Vuitton, there‚Äôs something quite dapper and appealing‚Äînot to mention endlessly flattering‚Äîabout the almighty waistcoat.   Pictured: Celine, Max Mara, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Marc Jacobs, Rag & Bone Etro gave the classic white suit an update with the addition of a matching vest styled underneath.  A camel-hued vest that can be worn under a blazer or solo.¬† Once reserved strictly for fall and winter, leather is  ready to have its moment during spring too. The material was spotted on spring 2020 runways from New York to Paris in just about every form‚Äîfrom colorful jackets at Coach 1941 and Bottega Veneta to skirts and pants at Marni and Alexander McQueen.  Pictured: Coach 1941, Bottega Veneta, Alexander McQueen, Sally LaPointe Get the look right for the season by opting for a colorful skirt or jacket iteration that can be styled countless ways. Going for lime-green separates and unexpected outerwear, Marni nailed it. Nothing says "spring leather" quite like this colorful rose skirt from Prada.¬† Designers are digging in their luxury heels when it comes to the almighty dot‚Äîsimply put, the trend shows no sign of slowing. The innovative duo that is Dries Van Noten and Christian Lacroix found a place for the polka dot on a maxi skirt-and-simple tank pairing, topped off with a head feather, while Balmain embraced volume for the enchanting print, and Wes Gordon at Carolina Herrera went fitted, '90s, and sheer for one of his takes on dots.

Wear this graphic dot print dress now with your favorite boots and with strappy sandals for all your spring weddings.¬†
 School-girl plaid just got a brand new beat. Few things say fall and back-to-school quite like a polished plaid. Once the domain of  classic Gaelic kilts, prep-school uniforms, and one immortal Cher Horowitz, the ultimate heritage fabric (it can be traced back nearly 3,000 years!) is seeing an autumn renaissance: It's been reshaped and rethought for a new generation of the mad-for-plaid. Now, there are tailored tartans with a twist and criss-crossed separates made to be mixed-and-matched. Even gowns are on the grid and come with statement-making flourishes. The bottom line? Whether worn while weaving through the city or lolling in the countryside, chic checks will have you one step ahead of any fashion curve. Garden Party  The easiest way to leave a lasting impression? A plethora of plaid paired with some made-for-Instagram sequin-stamped fur, of course! Next stop, Tinseltown.

 The supermodel is one of four protagonists in the new project.  "It‚Äôs just funny that this character was chosen for me because I can really relate to her, it‚Äôs a little emotional," says Gigi Hadid about her role in the 2019 Pirelli calendar. The latest calendar, lensed by renowned photographer Albert Watson, has a cinematic theme to it as the photographer has tapped four women to play characters and tell a story of the changing nature of ambition and success.   Hadid is certainly no stranger to success, but even the supermodel has been surprised by her own good fortune. "I think that it‚Äôs crazy because so many of the things I've accomplished, I didn‚Äôt think I would do, maybe ever‚Äîbut definitely not so quickly," she told Bazaar the day after shooting for the 2019 calendar.  However, Hadid's character shows a side to fame and fortune that most of us are not privy to. She plays an aristocrat, going through something in her life where she wants to get away from everyone, so she rents the penthouse of New York's Carlyle Hotel, and brings her trusted confidant (played by Alexander Wang) along. "I can kind of relate in a way, because I‚Äôm always traveling alone and sometimes I find myself, after being around hundreds of people, in a setting where it seems like a lot going for me and it's very glamorous, but at the end of the night I'm in a room by myself. I might be in a country where I don‚Äôt know anyone, in a weird time zone where no one at home is awake, and there‚Äôs no one to talk to."  Hadid says while there can be loneliness and sadness, there's also a beauty in it and a strength to be gained. "It's in these moments that you learn what you need to fulfill yourself. Over the last few years, for me, that‚Äôs been going to my family's farm and shutting off, so that when I return to work I can be present." Hadid noted that shooting this calendar was much different than her first time appearing in Pirelli's 2015 calendar lensed by Steven Meisel. "I don‚Äôt think I spoke the whole day, I was so shy and terrified. But that was such a good experience, and it obviously led to amazing things for me. Now I'm a completely different model, in terms of how much I‚Äôve learned, and I'm always striving to be better with every shoot."  The rest of the characters in the 2019 Pirelli calendar will be played by three other female protagonists including Julia Garner, who plays a botanical photographer who dreams of becoming a well-known portrait photographer.  Prima ballerina Misty Copeland is featured alongside Calvin Royal III who both dream of becoming stars.  Last but not least is French model/actress Laetitia Casta who fantasizes about becoming a world renowned painter.  The official 2019 calendar by Albert Watson will debut later this year in December. 
 From the Hadid's to Normani and Kacey Musgraves, see the red carpet's hottest looks.  Sure, award show season is cool, but have you ever seen the red carpet at one of Rihanna's Savage x Fenty shows?

 First step: Meet the handbag that‚Äôll take you everywhere. There are no rules when it comes to dressing full-on Gucci: One way may scream of logomania on steroids. Another may be an over-the-top approach that is at equal times artful, modern, and oozing confidence. Sure, wearing head-to-toe anything all day can feel a little impractical. But anything worth trying is going to fall a little outside your comfort zone. We‚Äôre betting the five scenarios below will have you feeling glad you did. So in the spirit of BAZAAR's legendary editor-in-chief Diana Vreeland, we‚Äôre asking why don‚Äôt you‚Ä¶  Take Your Pet Bunny to Lunch with Hands Covered in Sparkling Gems Your fur baby deserves only the finer things in life‚Äîincluding a carrier (AKA, a fabulous handbag big enough for bunny and your essentials) that is equally elegant as it is structural. And you deserve a fabulous outfit‚Äîand bag‚Äîto take him out. The minute the little prince emerges out of the emerald-green palace that is your bag, he should instantly spot his perfect reflection in the many statement jewels adorning your hands. He‚Äôll sit comfortably, knowing these stones are the second most precious things to grace the lunch table.   If pets are prohibited at your fine establishment of choice, throw on your fiercest animal-print dress and a collar necklace‚Äîin stylish solidarity of your furry friend, of course. After all, leopard print and jewels are suitable for any old place.  Strike a Power Pose in the Most Powerful Color of All‚ÄîRed  Channel a peacock spreading its feathers. A bouquet of flowers is cute, but a room full of matching flora is a visual arsenal. Likewise, one bag is practical, but you‚Äôve got things to do and places to be; hence, two handbags‚Äîa medium top handle and mini black version‚Äîmean you‚Äôre ready for battle. Also, one of anything worth having is never enough. Take a Royal Portrait With Your Zumi Family  What‚Äôs loved, cherished, and regal? Your Gucci bag collection of course. They may not all completely look the same: one may be a little more petite and subdued and another bolder in size and style, but they are all multifunctional.  They share a common crest‚Äîan interlocking G horsebit‚Äîand shared name, inspired by actress Zumi Rosow. So, gather your fanciest chairs and chaise and sit your adopted family around you like you‚Äôre the queen of England.  If you have only one Zumi, plop that baby on your lap like she‚Äôs an only child. Don‚Äôt forget to don your most proper double breasted dress, long white gloves, and add a tiara for good measure. If portrait taking isn't your style, consider a chaise lounge the ideal location to store your bags. They'll be within easy access, always on display, and be more like constant chic companions.  
 Wear Head-to-Toe Prints‚ÄîIncluding Your Bag When everyone is donning florals this spring, be a strawberry field in a sea of flowers. You‚Äôre unique, so you need a similarly special bag. Pair it with silk coordinates in a similar print for an interesting contrast in textures. Extra points for pink-tinted lips and flush. Game over for strawberry-toned tresses. 
  Practice Your Serve In a Fabulous Outfit (And Use a Chic Bag to Carry Your Balls)  You know what they say: Practice makes perfect. The truly dedicated and glamorous can do it anywhere, anytime. As long as you have your multifunctional carryall, with its detachable strap and double leather handles‚Äîin Wimbledon white, of course‚Äîyou‚Äôre aces.    
 The duo presented their second collection together at the Apollo. For their second design collaboration, Zendaya and Tommy Hilfiger brought New York Fashion Week to Harlem's iconic Apollo Theater last night. With an ode to both 1970s fashion and the African-American community, the duo transformed the runway into a block party bash.   Much like their first disco-themed runway starring Grace Jones, the energy of the TommyxZendaya Fall 2019 show was on another level‚Äîwith live music performances, dancing down the runway, and a full-on block party. The '70s city street-themed set even included two retro convertible cars, which models danced and walked around.    Bringing this energy from #tommyxzendaya into Monday morning üíØ @tommyhilfiger @zendaya @luxurylaw üé•: ELLE Digital Director @katielcon A post shared by  ELLE Magazine (@elleusa) on Sep 9, 2019 at 5:34am PDT  The diverse casting of models included a range of ages, races, and sizes‚Äîwith appearances by Halima Aden, Precious Lee, Winnie Harlow, Candice Swanepoel, Ebonee Davis, and a pregnant Ashley Graham.  And though they didn't hit the runway, Bella and Gigi Hadid sat front row in coordinating looks from the collection. As for the collection, Zendaya and Hilfiger stuck to taking inspiration from the late '70s and modernizing it for today. Suits, outerwear, and midi skirts reflective of the era were reimagined in sleek leathers mixed and matched with jewel-tone velvets and pops of snake print.  The fall pieces, which were shown in a see-now, buy-now format, are already available to shop online at tommyhilfiger.com. Prices range from $30 for the lacy undergarments to $1,295 for the tailored leather trench coat‚Äîwith most items falling in the $100-to-$300 range. Sadly, the collection marks the finale of Zendaya and Hilfiger's design collaboration. The designer reflected on the experience in the show notes left last night. SHOP TOMMYxZENDAYA NOW

 Baby animals included. NO ONE IS SAFE.  Harry Styles is back with another Gucci Men's campaign and honestly, I'm not sure any of us were prepared for this level of cuteness today. In fact, I'm not even sure this level of cuteness is legal in most countries, but anyway, I digress.  Marking his second set of ads for the Italian fashion brand, the singer was photographed by Glen Luchford in the historic Villa Lante just outside Rome. The beautiful renaissance garden location, along with Styles' natural penchant for wearing Gucci, could've been enough to carry the campaign on its own, but they went ahead and added a group of baby animals to the mix and wow, my heart grew three times faster than the Grinch's. Proceed ahead with caution.  First up: a photo of Harry and three baby piglets that I'm definitely not at all thinking of making my Christmas card this year:  This little baby goat took advantage of his time with Styles the same way any of us would: Me screaming in the background:  The most important thing to take from this campaign? Find someone who looks at you the way Harry looks at this adorable baby lamb:  Harry Styles in a series of tailored Gucci suits and accessories? Check. Dreamy Italian villa that I'd like to move into? Check. Collection of baby animals that I'd like to cuddle immediately? This may be the world's greatest thirst trap ever executed. Stay safe, folks.   
 Her photoshoot was cut because she "did not fit their market." Nina Agdal has publicly criticized a fashion magazine after it pulled a cover story that she was featured in. The Victoria's Secret model accused the unnamed publication of body shaming, after her agent was sent an email from the magazine, saying that the photoshoot "did not reflect well on [the] talent" and "did not fit their market." Agdal also claimed that the publisher "claimed my look deviated from my portfolio and that I did not fit into the (sample size) samples"‚Äîsomething the model denies.  Today, I‚Äôm disappointed and appalled at the still very harsh reality of this industry. A few months ago, I agreed to shoot with a creative team I believed in and was excited to collaborate with. When my agent received an unapologetic email concluding they would not run my cover/story because it ‚Äúdid not reflect well on my talent‚Äù and ‚Äúdid not fit their market,‚Äù the publisher claimed my look deviated from my portfolio and that I did not fit into the (sample size) samples, which is completely false. If anyone has any interest in me, they know I am not an average model body - I have an athletic build and healthy curves.  After a tough year of taking a step back from the insensitive and unrealistic pressures of this industry and dealing with paralyzing social anxiety, I walked into that shoot as a 25 year old WOMAN feeling more comfortable in my own skin and healthier than ever before. Some days I‚Äôm a sample size, some days I‚Äôm a size 4, some a 6. I am not built as a runway model and have never been stick thin. Now more than ever, I embrace my curves and work diligently in the gym to stay strong and most of all, sane.  I am proud to say that my body has evolved from when I started this crazy ride as a 16 year old GIRL with unhealthy and insufficient eating habits. So, shame on you and thank you to the publisher for reaffirming how important it is to live your truth and say it out loud, no matter who you are or what size. I decided to release an image to draw awareness and support of an issue that's bigger than just myself and affects so many people not just in the fashion industry, but in general, with the goal of bringing women from all over together in a celebration of our bodies. Let's find ways to build each other up instead of constantly finding ways to tear each other down.  #bodyshaming #bodyimage #selfimage #dietculture #mybodymybusiness A post shared by  Nina Agdal (@ninaagdal) on Jan 12, 2018 at 9:30am PST In a lengthy Instagram post, she expressed her anger and disappointment "at the still very harsh reality of this industry." Agdal said she fluctuates between a size 4 and a size 6. Adgal wrote:  Obviously having the worst time ever x 2 A post shared by  Nina Agdal (@ninaagdal) on Dec 27, 2017 at 3:33pm PST Prior to the shoot, Agdal had taken a year break from "the insensitive and unrealistic pressures of this industry" to deal with her anxiety issues. Her post has attracted over 3,000 mostly supportive comments. 
From: Harper's BAZAAR UK

 The designer celebrates 20 years with a Barneys capsule collection All the cliches about cyclical fashion and falling in and out of it are cliches for a reason. So when a designer hits the two decade mark it's not to be overlooked. Narciso Rodriguez is a champion of minimalism, a true New York designer, famed for dressing Michelle Obama and noted in the history books for changing the bridal game forever by designing a simple and beautiful slip dress for his friend, the late Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy. To mark 20-years in business, Narciso Rodriguez will be re-releasing nine archival looks from the span of his career‚Äîranging from Spring 2003-Fall 2013‚Äîwith Barneys. Below Rodriguez talks about the highlights, the key to longevity‚Äîhint: "perseverance and resilience are key,"‚Äîand how he picked favorites. "It was a process of delving into the archives combined with rigorous editing," the designer explains, "I ended up choosing personal favorites along with client favorites that were also critically well-received. It was fun, inspiring‚Äîand educational." What are three of your most memorable fashion moments from twenty years of having a brand?  When the First Lady, Michelle Obama, wore my dress on Election Night in 2008! I  was completely shocked and honored to be even a small part of such a monumental moment in history. She‚Äôs a woman of such strength, intelligence and beauty that I‚Äôm still overcome.  Another highlight involved Mrs. Obama six years later when I won the National Design Award; she held a luncheon at the White House to celebrate the Awards and I was so honored. Finally, I consider my close friend Carolyn Bessette Kennedy‚Äôs wedding to be a personal highlight.  She was one of the most important people in my life, and to design her dress and be part of her wedding, such a happy time in her life, was also one of the happiest times of my life and one of the most gratifying. Do you think it‚Äôs easier or harder now to launch a fashion brand than when you did?    It was so much easier back then because there were not nearly as many brands to compete with and celebrity brands did not even exist.  It was obviously such a different world; the pace was slower and more considered.   Do you have a top red carpet moment?   It was very gratifying when Rachel Weisz accepted her Academy Award in 2006 wearing a dress I‚Äôd made for her. It was her big night‚Äîand it meant so much to me that to dress someone who I cared so much about on such a joyful occasion.  How do you think you‚Äôve been able to have a consistent aesthetic that your customer responds to for two decades?  Perseverance and resilience are key. I also try to remain true to my vision. The idea is to create ‚Äògo-to‚Äô pieces for a woman‚Äôs wardrobe and her life‚Äîbeautifully-crafted pieces that a woman will love today, in two months, in two years, in five years‚Äîand to do that for as many women as possible.    How do you define minimalism?  Minimalism has become such a broad term when it comes to design.   When I try to define my own work I think about pure design, a focus on purity in all aspects of the work; from palette to craft to cut.   Are runway shows still important?  A runway show can be the best way to show your work.  The past few seasons, I‚Äôve preferred a smaller and more intimate setting for the show‚Äîthere‚Äôs nothing like seeing the work up close.  And nothing compares to seeing the way clothing fits on the body and moves with the body.
 The just-launched Loucite line showcases a more playful side of the fine jewelry label. Alison Chemla, creative director and designer of Alison Lou, a fine jewelry brand based in New York City, just happens to be close friends with Insta-famous A-list actress Emily Ratajkowski. So, it seemed only natural for the designer to tap her model pal to star as the face for the label's just-launched collection, Loucite by Alison Lou.  The 12-piece Loucite line is comprised of a full-range of fun and playful enamel-based colorful "jelly" hoops, which are sold in three sizes (small, medium, large). The brand's newest campaign imagery showcases a stunning Ratajkowski in a series of semi-scandalous shots, sporting only a PVC transparent jacket and the Loucite hoops.  LOUcite: my latest endeavor that I am so excited to share with you all. First, I want to thank Emily - these images are beyond what I could have ever imagined. LOUcite is a natural extension of my brand. We worked tirelessly to bring you something fresh and accessible. The Jelly Hoops come in a wide range of colors and sizes. I hope you love them as much as I do! Stock is limited. Happy Shopping ‚ù§Ô∏è Alison Very Special Thanks to: @jacqharriet @daniellenachmani @hungvango @teddicranfordhair @brynsmth & most importantly....@alexandratirsch and @mflewin (that‚Äôs in no specific order)! A post shared by  ALISON LOU‚Ñ¢ (@alisonlou) on Apr 23, 2018 at 6:00am PDT Alison Lou Loucite Small Jelly Hoops, $125, Alison Lou.com. SHOP Chelma said the partnership between Ratajkowski and the Alison Lou jewelry label felt perfect for this fresh and fun collection. ‚ÄúEmily has been a good friend and close to the brand for some time now," the designer explained. "Launching Loucite was really special to me and this felt like the right moment to work together.‚Äù  Medium Green Jelly Hoops: Made of Lucite and hand painted Enamel. All of LOUcite is super lightweight- making them your daily go to üíö A post shared by  ALISON LOU‚Ñ¢ (@alisonlou) on Apr 23, 2018 at 2:03pm PDT Of the new collection, Chemla explains it was a long-time in the works, but a natural extension of her brand vision and an effort to bring customers something a bit more accessible. ‚ÄúLoucite is a natural extension of Alison Lou," said Chemla. "It showcases the playfulness at the core of my brand and has allowed me to explore new forms of creative expression. While fine jewelry will always remain my first love, being able to take enamel, something that is ever present in my fine jewelry, and apply it to Lucite was just so fun." ‚ÄúWe wanted to create an affordable, accessible collection, using unique materials and were very thoughtful when it came to the colors and sizing of our Loucite Jelly Hoops- the smallest are great for every day, the medium for day-to-night and the largest are perfect for a fun night out," the jewelry designer continued. "We‚Äôve truly created the perfect earring just in time for the warmer months.‚Äù The Loucite Jelly Hoops retail from $125 (small) to $165 (large) and are also available in curated sets of three, which are sold for $395. The full collection is now available on the brand's site, and at its flagship location, 20 East 69th Street in New York City. The line will also be available for purchase on Net-A-Porter beginning mid-May. 
 The brand's trademarked chocolate diamonds have been worn by Rihanna, Madonna, Jennifer Lopez, and Taylor Swift. From the red carpet to the aisle, diamonds are‚Äîas Marilyn Monroe so aptly put it‚Äîa girl's best friend. And with that logic, some of the world's rarest diamonds are bound to attract a VIP best friend base‚Äîthink Rihanna, Jennifer Lopez, Taylor Swift, Madonna and more.  Le Vian is celebrating 20 years of their signature Chocolate Diamonds, the natural fancy color brown diamonds that are not too dark or light in color that adorned Rihanna's neck at the 2018 Grammy Awards and JLo's ears on the cover of Harper's BAZAAR. The brand first introduced Chocolate Diamonds in 2000, with a "chocolate and vanilla diamond" collection, and has since evolved the look to include their latest ombr√© creations of chocolate and nude diamonds, which span the spectrum of the stone's shades.  Le Vian's rich history in the fine jewelry world can be traced back to 1746, when the Shah of Iran conquered India, and chose the LeVian family to guard the royal jewels‚Äîincluding the Koh-i-Noor diamond, which is currently housed in the Royal Family's Crown Jewels in the Tower of London. It's no surprise that the LeVian family is now the leading purveyor of one of the rarest diamonds in the world, given their deep understanding of the finest jewels in the world, passed down for multiple generations. No inclusions, superior clarity, natural color, fancy color, and sustainable sourcing are required for a diamond to be considered a Chocolate Diamond, leaving only 4% of the world's brown diamonds to select from. In the past year, no more than 100 Chocolate Diamonds larger than 1.5 carats were found, and given the closure of Australia's Argyle Mine, the leading source of Chocolate Diamonds and pink diamonds in the world, that number is expected to drop significantly, making Rihanna's favorite red carpet pieces that much more rare. Le Vian has celebrated their signature stone in the past with a trademarked in-store chocolate scent, but in celebration of the 20th anniversary of their trademarked stone, the brand is launching a limited-edition capsule collection of Chocolate Diamond rings, available for purchase for a limited time in select stores.  
 The fashion brand takes action following its recent blackface controversy.  Gucci is making changes. The Italian fashion brand announced a new global program and scholarship fund, called Gucci Changemakers, that will promote diversity and inclusion throughout the company with a multi-step action plan. The new initiative comes after the brand received backlash over a balaclava sweater resembling blackface last month.  The program includes three separate tiers: the Gucci Changemakers Fund, a scholarship program, and a company-wide volunteering initiative. All three programs are meant to foster racial diversity in both the company and the fashion industry as a whole. The changes come after Harlem couturier Dapper Dan (who has an ongoing collaboration with the brand) met with Gucci's CEO and President Marco Bizzarri to voice his concerns. "We will invest important resources to unify and strengthen our communities across North America, with a focus on programs that will impact youth and the African-American community," Bizzarri said in a statement from the brand. "I believe in the promise of the next generation, and through our scholarship fund we will also create more opportunities for talented young people of diverse backgrounds to gain access to careers in the fashion industry."  Dan took to Instagram to share progress on Gucci's new initiative yesterday, revealing he's been working closely with the brand to help foster such changes.  A post shared by Dapper Dan (@dapperdanharlem) on Mar 17, 2019 at 1:50pm PDT "As a partner, I am proud to work with Gucci and other community leaders to help guide programs that will create meaningful impact for the Black community and fashion as a whole," Dapper Dan said in a statement from Gucci. "It is imperative that we have a seat at the table to say how we should be represented and reimagined. Through our work together, Gucci is in a position to lead the overall industry toward becoming a better more inclusive one." The first sector of the program, the Gucci Changemakers Fund, is a $5 million fund that will invest in community-based programs, particularly those helping communities of color, in cities across the U.S. The programs will be selected by the Changemakers Council, a board of advisors including Dapper Dan, Bethann Hardison, Cleo Wade, Will.i.am, and more.  The second component to Gucci Changemakers is a scholarship program helping a more diverse talent pool of students pursue careers in fashion. Each student selected will receive a $20,000 grant toward their education over the course of four years.  Finally, a new volunteer initiative will allow Gucci's 18,000 employees across the globe to take up to four paid days off to participate in volunteer work that addresses issues including equality, support for refugees and the homeless, protection of the environment and education.

 After 50 years spent remaking American glamour, Ralph Lauren hasn‚Äôt just changed the way we dress‚Äîthe internationally influential business mogul, iconoclast, and philanthropist has also changed the way we live and dream. When someone hears the word ‚Äúpolo‚Äù today, he or she is as likely to think of the brand founded in 1967 by a young man from the Bronx as the millennia-old sport played by the world‚Äôs elite for which it was named. For the past 50 years, Ralph Lauren, through his namesake luxury brands, has not only been outfitting us to live our best lives but also defining our view of what that looks like. What might an elegant self-made American man who attains the pinnacle of wealth and leisure wear on a hot summer afternoon? F. Scott Fitzgerald created Gatsby, but Lauren conjured our vision of him in a white linen suit, a version of which the designer himself is wearing on the June day I visit him. Ralph Lauren‚Äôs clothes are worn by magnates and movie stars, princesses and prime ministers, aristocrats and Olympians: They are symbols of success, luxury, and achievement that have become indistinguishable from the things themselves. ‚ÄúRalph Lauren‚Äôs vision has defined American style for decades, elevating fashion and culture.‚Äù ‚ÄîOprah Winfrey  The themes that entranced Lauren when he was starting out, and to which he has returned through the years, have become hallmarks: Safari, Cowboy, Military, Hollywood, Art Deco modernism, and Navajo. He refers to them as ‚Äústandards,‚Äù motifs he can riff on over time. ‚ÄúI saw not what we were as Americans, but what we could become,‚Äù he tells me. What he became‚Äîin addition to an international icon at the helm of a multibilliondollar company‚Äîis, above all, a family man, married for 53 years to Ricky, a natural American beauty of the kind that grace his ads and walk his runways, with children and grandchildren; and beautiful homes in New York‚Äî in Manhattan, Montauk, and Bedford‚ÄîColorado, and Jamaica. What he wanted for himself, he wanted for all of us too. His lifestyle is inseparable from what he offers us through his collections of clothing, furniture, and lifestyle accessories, and the advertising imagery he created to market them. ‚ÄúEverything is part of what I was dreaming for myself,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI responded to the vibrations in the world I loved‚Äîblack-and white films, the Kennedys, Sinatra, my first trip to Santa Fe‚Äîand I expanded them and fed them back to the world.‚Äù ‚ÄúHis success is matched only by his humanity.‚Äù‚ÄîVera Wang How does one designer so inhabit the aesthetic of the American dream? I ask. ‚ÄúI am American culture,‚Äù he says simply and directly. ‚ÄúI am an American.‚Äù His words echo the famous opening declaration of Saul Bellow‚Äôs great American novel, The Adventures of Augie March: ‚ÄúI am an American, Chicago born‚Ä¶I have taught myself, freestyle, and will make the record in my own way.‚Äù To make the most of one‚Äôs natural gifts and to wing it with all you‚Äôve got are the most American of qualities, and Ralph Lauren is our most American of designers. Lauren‚Äôs unwavering consistency to his vision has yielded one of the most powerful and lucid brands ever but is what leaves him prey to criticism. Fashion is a fickle beast beholden to the zeitgeist, but Lauren dreams in absolutes, in classics, in icons: nautical stripes, peacoats, and sailor‚Äôs caps fit for a Jean Sebergian American in Paris; a slinky satin number worthy of Dietrich; wide-legged pinstriped trousers conjuring Keaton‚Äôs Annie Hall; a high-necked white blouse with a big leather belt suited to Meryl Streep playing Isak Dinesen on the African plain. Lauren believes in the purity of this vision, while most designers are not so devout to their muses. ‚ÄúI feel like my closet is Ralph‚Äôs closet...When I played Annie Hall, her look was very Ralph and, of course, very me.‚Äù‚ÄîDiane Keaton It‚Äôs this aspirational purity that was celebrated in the 1980s by two Brooklyn gangs that merged under the moniker Lo Lifes (‚ÄúLo‚Äù being short for Polo). The only requirement for membership was total dedication to dressing head-to-toe in Polo‚Äîacquisitions gained through shoplifting. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt worn by people who lived in our community,‚Äù cofounder Rack-Lo has been quoted as saying. ‚ÄúPolo was made for the rich, Waspy kids; it wasn‚Äôt made for urban kids.‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why, but they got it,‚Äù Lauren says. ‚ÄúThey understood the purity of my vision.‚Äù Of course they got it. These kids saw the magic of clothes to take them up out of their neighborhood and into a more spectacular life, just as Lauren did as a young man. Today, Lo Life‚Äôs embrace of Lauren‚Äôs vision is fueling an active vintage market in those pieces as well as in limited reissue product drops by Ralph Lauren from the Polo archives. ‚ÄúRalph is the holy grail: Whether he‚Äôs selling a suit, a paint color, or a hamburger, he is always designing a dream.‚Äù‚ÄîAlexander Wang A successful brand speaks to people wherever they are, not just to a targeted demographic. My 78-year-old father wears a Polo shirt at the country club in Palm Beach because it means one thing in his world, and my 17-year-old son wears ‚Äô90s Polo at the skate park on the Lower East Side because it signifies something else. On the day I visit, Lauren shares with me images of the upcoming women‚Äôs runway collection, his 88th show, for his 50th-anniversary extravaganza. He shows no signs of slowing down or losing interest; in fact, he is particularly excited by the way this show reinterprets and juxtaposes many of his beloved standards. As with nearly every fashion brand, Ralph Lauren the company has had its share of struggles in the past few years. Lauren and his current CEO have a set of ‚Äústrategic priorities‚Äù that includes digital growth, the reinvigoration of its core business, and targeted expansion. What will be achieved and who will succeed Lauren are unknown. What is known is that the ineffable magic that Ralph Lauren has created, and its presence in our collective consciousness, make his successes over the past five decades the ultimate achievement of American brand-making for, like, well, ever.

 Who needs a fashion show when you have Kim's social media following? Kim Kardashian isn't just in Tokyo to enjoy a sister trip with Kourtney and Khlo√©, she's also flaunting her husband Kanye West's newest Yeezy collection. The reality star has been in the Japanese capital for a few days now, but unbeknownst to us, she was sporting Yeezy Season 7 all along. Kim made the official reveal on Twitter this afternoon. "I‚Äôm gonna post some Tokyo fashion real quick since it‚Äôs 5am and I can‚Äôt sleep," she tweeted. "All Yeezy Season 7," she added. The first look was her airport outfit, which consisted of an oversized neutral shearling jacket, a cropped cream quarter zip, grey sweat pants, and snakeskin boots. The second was an all-metallic getup featuring a mini puffer jacket, biker shorts, chunky socks, dad sneakers, and a pink flip phone (yes, really).  so cool A post shared by  Kim Kardashian Snapchat üçë (@kimkardashiansnap) on Feb 26, 2018 at 5:14am PST And the third look was a blue body-hugging dress, fanny pack, oversized gray zip-up hoodie, and clunky footwear once again. The shoot was cleverly staged at a souvenir shop called Chicago, just like her newborn. This isn‚Äôt Kanye‚Äôs first time debuting new designs on his wife, paparazzi-style. They pulled off the same move in December when Kim wore Yeezy Season 6 looks (styled by BAZAAR‚Äôs Global Fashion Director, Carine Roitfeld) around Los Angeles. West then used the ‚Äúcandid‚Äù photos for the ad campaign, which released last month on social media, starring other celebs and influencers, from Paris Hilton to Kylie Jenner‚Äôs best friend Jordyn Woods, and more. After being slammed by the fashion world for hosting unorganized presentations during NYFW, it‚Äôs a smart move for West to ditch the runways and instead debut his collections to Kim Kardashian‚Äôs massive social media following (she has 58.9 million followers on Twitter and 108 million on Instagram).

 You can't carry anything in it, but you can look like a luxury slice of Swiss cheese.  It's no secret that It bags have been getting weirder and weirder for several seasons now. From Jacquemus' teeny tiny bags that only hold a single AirPod to handbags worn as necklaces and bracelets, designers have been pushing the limits on just how quirky they can go. The latest comes from Off-White's Virgil Abloh, who sent a leather bag filled with giant holes down his Spring 2020 runway.  The perplexing accessory, dubbed the "Meteor" bag, is punctured with three giant holes, including one in the bottom corner. According to the brand, the bag, which can't actually carry any of your belongings, is intentionally "unfunctional." Despite that, it still retails for $1,665.    For its runway debut at Paris Fashion Week, models put their arms through the holes of the bag, as one does. The collection was inspired by a meteor shower, hence the dramatic holes and name of the It bag. If you know anything about science, you know this is exactly the kind of effect a cosmic event has on one's accessories.      Fans of Off-White will notice that the new Meteor bag is simply a holy-er version of the brand's Jitney bag. Earlier this year, the Jitney bag raised eyebrows with its "Cash Inside" instructions, an invitation for people to rob it.  It's clear the trend of Instagram-baiting bags isn't dying down any time soon. Perhaps designers are trying symbolize our need to carry less baggage. But perhaps it's just one big competition to see who can get consumers to spend the most money on a bag that doesn't actually serve a purpose. 
 It's the supermodel's fourth partnership with the designer. It was a family affair at Tommy Hilfiger‚Äôs Spring 2018 racing-themed fashion show in Milan on Sunday night, with model siblings Gigi, Bella and Anwar Hadid all walking in the runway event. In an interview before the buzzy show, Hadid described feeling emotional about her fourth and final partnership with the designer. "I walked into Tommy's dressing room this morning, and we both had to kind of not talk about it, because you'd start tearing up," she said, adding that it's the collection she‚Äôs most proud of. Titled ‚ÄúDrive,‚Äù the show paid tribute to Hilfiger‚Äôs love for racing and his partnership with Formula One team Mercedes-AMG Petronas Motorsport. Guests 'grammed race cars, simulators and pit crews complete with power tools before the event got underway with Hadid wearing a THxGH-branded crop top and color-block leather moto pants.  The collection, which the model described as ‚Äúbold, effortless, and fast,‚Äù was a cool mash-up that adhered to the racing theme and incorporated '90s references. Other standouts included a black-and-white checkerboard-print bike short (very Saved By the Bell‚Äîin a good way), a logo-patterned windbreaker and a mesh crop top. In addition to the Hadids, Hailey Baldwin, Lucky Blue Smith and Winnie Harlow modeled pieces for an audience that included Ruby Rose and Olivia Palermo, among other boldface names.  Reflecting on the past four seasons, Hilfiger described Hadid as ‚Äúan amazing talent. She works hard, is humble, relentless, and has a great sense of style."  Items from the show are available now as part of the designer's "see-now, buy now" model. Shop a couple pieces below!

 The ultimate #TBT. In the early 2000s, you probably collected Victoria's Secret's PINK sweats in various colors and wore them around proudly, with the logo on your behind and the gartered hems either rolled up to your calves or tucked into your UGGs. (We've all been there.) Though versions of the pant have been around for years, the original design hasn't been available since it launched in 2002‚Äîbut that changes now.  Victoria's Secret is re-releasing its famous PINK sweatpants, and they're only available for today (Thursday, September 21). The collegiate-inspired pieces are currently selling for $40 at select stores across the U.S. Locations If you can't make it today, you'll have a chance to shop an exclusive blinged-out version (pictured above) online at victoriassecret.com/pink on Sunday, September 24 from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. shop  To add to the nostalgia, VS also dug into its archives and shared some throwback campaign photos of Miranda Kerr, Elsa Hosk, Behati Prinsloo, and Candice Swanepoel models modeling the loungewear. Best. #TBT. Ever.
 The 2017 U.S. Open champion returns to Arthur Ashe Stadium for a high-fashion match‚Äîagainst herself. (Before getting real about the art of an epic comeback, of course.) What's going on with Sloane Stephens? That's the question on the mind of anyone keeping up with tennis at the moment.  "My drive comes from my team," the 24-year-old U.S. Open champion, who surprised fans by losing her first match at last week's Australian Open, reveals to  BAZAAR.com. "I have great people around me, always supporting me. I always remember‚Äîeventually I‚Äôm going to win a match." But for those not familiar with her story, let's quickly rewind: By 2016, the rising tennis star had beaten Venus Williams, challenged Serena, and risen to the ranking of 25 in the world before she was forced to withdraw from that year's U.S. Open due to a foot injury. Stephens was out of commission for 11 months before finally making her return at Wimbeldon in July, 2017‚Äîranked 957. Nine hundred and fifty seven. She lost in straight sets the first round. Then, at the 2017 U.S. Open, with Serena Williams sitting out for maternity leave, all eyes were on the sport's young talents, new names and past champions‚Äîand Sloane Stephens did the impossible.  After making it through each round and playing part in a historic all-American women's semi-final, Stephens met her friend, Madison Keys, in the finals. Keys was ranked 15 at the time. Sloane won the championship title in under an hour, and then abandoned her post while the United States Tennis Association (USTA) set up the championship ceremony, in order to comfort Keys as she wept in disappointment. Since then, Sloane has not won a single match. Not one. But she's not fazed by this. "I like to take it practice by practice, match by match, tournament by tournament," she explains. "It‚Äôs important to stay focused on the present and not get too caught up on the 'what could be' and the noise around you." In the vein of staying positive, we took Stephens back to the site of her last victory, Arthur Ashe Stadium in the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, to serve her best shots‚Äîalong with Spring 2018's boldest looks. Stephens described the visit as surreal: "I‚Äôve only ever seen Arthur Ashe filled with fans. It reminded me that I did actually win the U.S. Open."

 Former fashion editor Lauren Chan noticed something missing in the industry, so she created it herself. It all began when former fashion editor Lauren Chan couldn't find anything to wear to work. "While my colleagues were often in designer clothes, I mostly wore fast-fashion because that‚Äôs all that fit me," she says." I didn‚Äôt look as put-together and as capable as those colleagues, and I grew sick of the disadvantage I faced because of my size." Chan decided it was time to start her own brand, focusing on luxury, tailored workwear for plus-size women. At a private presentation at Showfields during New York Fashion Week, she debuted Henning, a line of power suits, well-constructed trousers, and button-down shirts that didn't pop open at the buttons. "Henning‚Äôs message is to tell women like me that they deserve to be on the same level as everyone else," Chan explains.   @henning launched yesterday! The site is alive (henningnyc.com)! The @instagram @shop is open! More photos to come, but for now this @maceyhall shot is all I can muster. üñ§ A post shared by  LAUREN CHAN (@lcchan) on Sep 4, 2019 at 6:48am PDT  The debut collection for Henning delivers a level of detailing and luxury that plus-size customers aren't typically offered. There are double-breasted suits and trench jackets that provide the backbone of the classic work wardrobe, but there's also a blue satin suit and dress that adds some playfulness and a splash of color to the mix.   Most importantly, Chan included additional design elements that are often overlooked in the plus-size market. The inner thigh of the trousers is reinforced with a gel tape to help prevent ripping along the seam from thigh chafing. The pants also feature a hidden elastic waist that provides more room without looking cheap. And as women with full chests know, finding a button-down that doesn't gape at the buttons is nearly impossible, so Chan added hidden buttons to make sure the shirt doesn't pull open at the bust.   The collection is currently available in sizes 12-24, but Chan is aiming to make it more personal in the future. "I hope to explore custom sizing as soon as possible. I want Henning to help eliminate clothes that don‚Äôt fit‚Äîand the feeling that comes with clothes that do. Women above size 12 deserve to focus on kicking ass in whatever they do, not in too-tight pants."  As Henning's Instagram points out, 68 percent of American women wear a size 14 or above, but plus-size clothing makes up only 2.3 percent of the selection at major retailers. When you look at the runways of New York Fashion Week, that percentage gets even smaller. For Henning, the stats are a chance to school other brands in what they should be doing. Chan is just getting started.
 You can shop an early release of the collection this Saturday!  This year's H&M designer collaboration is sure to bring the tulle. The fast-fashion retailer is teaming up with couturier Giambattista Valli for its annual high-low offering, which means we can expect a lot of dreamy, frothy, princess-worthy pieces from this capsule. Unlike H&M's previous designer collabs that were released in the fall, the Valli capsule will have an early "pre-drop" on May 25 with nine looks in select stores and online. The entire range will launch on November 7.  If this collection is anything like its predecessors, it's sure to sell out instantly.    Creative, cool and couture-like. Welcome to the exciting world of the Paris-based master of beauty and sophistication. @giambattistavalliparis is this year‚Äôs designer collaboration! @hm #Projectüñ§ On 25 May, we will release a pre-drop from @giambattistavalliparis x @hm with a limited edition of nine looks, as well as a few accessories, in selected stores and online. The main collection will launch on 7 November 2019. #giambattistavalli A post shared by  H&M (@hm) on May 23, 2019 at 10:16am PDT Kendall Jenner already wore a gown from the collection at the amfAR gala in Cannes today. She even posed with the designer as she made her entrance in a hot pink layered frock.  Other stars also attended the f√™te in various Giambattista Valli x H&M ensembles, including H.E.R., Chiara Ferragni, Bianca Brandolini, Chris Lee, and Ross Lynch. They were all wearing limited-edition looks from the upcoming pre-drop release.  Valli was born in Rome but his eponymous brand, which he launched in 2005, is based in Paris. He moved to the French capital "because I was dreaming of building up a proper haute couture maison," he says in a video promoting the H&M collaboration.  "Couture is the art of making beautiful fabrics and experimenting," he adds. "It's the freedom of bringing like, a dream into a reality. I'm totally excited to see what's going to happen with this collaboration and all the love stories that are going to start around the world."  His imprint may best be known by decadent layers of tulle (often pink), an extravagant romantic flair, and big, billowy silhouettes.   H&M is "thrilled" to collaborate with the designer, the company's creative advisor, Ann-Sofie Johansson, said in a press release. "He is the undisputed master of haute couture with a knack for the memorable silhouette. To be able to bring his signature styles to our customers is a dream come true." Valli is the latest major designer to team up with the retailer, following brands Moschino, Erdem, Kenzo, Balmain, and Alexander Wang.    We've seen a number of stellar Giambattista numbers on the red carpet in recent years, including this month's camp-themed Met Gala. Emma Roberts, Lily Collins, and Lana Condor all wore lavish gowns by the designer.   Rihanna has also proven to be a fan of the brand, famously wearing some of its pink designs to the 2015 Grammy Awards and during her 2017 Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets film press tour.    In recent months, other standout Valli moments include Jennifer Lopez at the Second Act premiere, Kacey Musgraves at the 2019 Oscars, and Deepika Padukone at Cannes Film Festival.  We can't wait to get our hands on these fluffy, fanciful pieces. While you wait for the H&M drop, here are some Giambattista Valli pieces you can shop in the meantime.  

 Under the Eiffel Tower, no less.  To close out Day 2 of Paris Fashion Week, Saint Laurent echoed last season by holding its runway show underneath a sparkling Eiffel Tower. But this time, the fashion house one-upped itself by having its lineup of models walk on water‚Äîliterally.  Saint Laurent's Spring 2019 show took place after sunset, with the water-filled runway brightened by white electric palm trees. Although the star-studded front row‚Äîfilled with everyone from Kate Moss and Cindy Crawford to Salma Hayek and a surprise appearance by Lindsay Lohan‚Äîit was the picturesque runway that really stole the show.  Stiletto heels and all, models glided across the water-submerged runway in the brand's Spring/Summer 2019 collection, which included a whopping 95 looks. Literally walking on water at Saint Laurent pic.twitter.com/qnT6NfyqPi Designers ruining a lot of perfectly good shoes with these water effects this season! @YSL #pfw pic.twitter.com/pBPUXg52l0 It's unclear whether any Saint Laurent shoes were actually ruined for this photo op, but between the whole walking-on-water thing and the Eiffel Tower backdrop, the scene couldn't have been more breathtaking.  If you've seen Crazy Rich Asians, however, this runway setup may look a bit familiar to you. The film's incredibly over-the-top wedding scene similarly featured the bride walking down an aisle flowing with water.  Perhaps one of 2018's hottest film inspired Saint Laurent designer Anthony Vaccarello while prepping for the presentation? While no extravagant wedding gowns appeared in the show's lineup, there were plenty of glitzy mini dresses and sheer looks for the Saint Laurent party girl to choose. 
 The throwback looks that still work today.  We all know that when it comes to fashion and trends, what goes around comes around. The good news is that if you're in need of summer style inspo and your Instagram feed simply isn't cutting it, you can look back to the ladies who wore your favorite summer looks first. From the '20s to the early aughts, get inspired by these throwback looks and trends that still work for summer 2019. When in doubt, high-waisted shorts and a tank top or one-piece are always an effortless go-to for summer, as perfected in the summers of the '20s.  Wear them as a swimsuit cover-up or with a bodysuit on your summer¬†weekends.¬†¬† The duster jacket may be a street-style favorite, but take note from the ladies of the '20s and try it as a swimsuit cover-up too.  Wear it in the summer¬†with your favorite swimsuit and then again in the fall layered over a T-shirt and jeans.¬† The women of the '30s counted on floral and bold print dresses to stand out during a time of fashion cutbacks due to the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl. The same remains true today: If you're sticking to a budget this season, go for an item that stands out in color and pattern.  The perfect printed midi dress to wear from work to the weekend.¬† From day to night to the beach, a pair of wide-leg pants is the perfect base for any summer look.  Available in chambray or khaki, these high-waisted, wide-leg pants are flattering with a blazer and tank for the office, or a bodysuit on the weekend.¬† The high-waisted bikini reigns as one of summer 2019's hottest swim trends. Take note from Betty Grable's beach style and opt for a bright color.   A bright shade of orange goes perfectly with a sun-kissed glow. Shop the matching bikini top here.¬† Channel the early '40s by tying the ends of your button-down into a knot and pairing with a fun pair of printed shorts.  Roll up the sleeves and wear this as a top or a swimsuit cover-up.¬† Dior's 1947 New Look complete with a full skirt lent for a perfect summer silhouette that still feels glamorous to this day.  A full maxi skirt that'll look best with a white crop top, bikini top, or bodysuit.¬† The '50s-favored sweetheart neckline looks best with a fit-and-flair dress that cinches your waist √† la Sophia Loren.  Get the '50s look with one of Reformation's printed sweetheart-neckline dresses.¬† Cat-eye sunglasses + a scarf tied as a headband = the perfect accessory equation for a beach moment on level with Grace Kelly in To Catch a Thief. Try the look in summer's animal-print trend. Wear it as a headband, bandana, or neck scarf all season long.¬†¬† Take the full circle skirt out of the 1950s housewife's kitchen and onto the beach by pairing it with a strapless bikini top and flat sandals. Pair it with a bikini top and you've got an instant beach LEWK.¬† Opt for a crochet minidress that looks ready for any summer occasion and hope to look half as cool as Twiggy.  A vacation-ready crochet midi dress for all your warm-weather getaways.¬† Work a pop of color into your look in the form of a miniskirt that still packs as much punch as it did in the '60s.  Heron Preston's colorful denim skirt is a way to modernize the look for 2019.¬† Channel your inner Brigitte Bardot by the beach or the pool in a wide-brimmed hat, triangle bikini, and classic sarong.  Create your own shade with Cuyana's chic wide-brim hat. Who needs the naked dress when you can have the naked bathing suit? Bo Derek's Bond girl beach moment is timeless for summer; get your nude one-piece ready.  Candice Swanepoel's swimwear line offers a minimal (and sustainable) one-piece in several different shades to get the look.¬† Off-the-shoulder dresses still remain a summertime wardrobe staple. If you want to go full-on '70s, pair the look with a pair of platform sandals.  An eco-conscious piece that brings a little texture and pattern to your summer wardrobe.¬†
 After her divorce, it took on another meaning. Princess Diana's style remains inimitable to this day, and that's why so many designers wanted to dress her throughout her life.  But according to a new report, following her divorce from Prince Charles, Princess Diana no longer wanted to wear items featuring the Chanel logo for a heartbreaking, but totally understandable, reason. In a new interview with Harper's BAZAAR Australia, the Australian designer Jayson Brundson discusses working with Diana in 1996, during her final visit to Australia for a charity event. Brundson told the publication: But when it came to accessorizing Diana's outfit, Brundson recalls her decision not to wear Chanel shoes: Princess Diana's divorce from Prince Charles was finalized in August 1996. But throughout their marriage, Camilla Parker Bowles was always present. In fact, before Princess Diana's separation from Prince Charles was announced, tapes of romantic phone calls between Camilla and Charles were leaked, leading to rumors of infidelity.  In a TV interview in 1994, Prince Charles admitted that he'd committed adultery while still married, but he claimed it happened only after "it became clear that the marriage had irretrievably broken down."
 And she says it will channel the '80s. In 1981, Princess Diana married Prince Charles in a very epic, very '80s dress.  The iconic gown was designed by Elizabeth Emanuel and her then-husband David Emanuel. Now, Elizabeth Emanuel is gearing up to launch a new fashion label called Emanuel Mayfair, according to People.  The designer says the new line will be inspired by the energy of the '80s.  "It will have the spirit of Emanuel from the days when we made dresses some of the most of the most iconic women of the time like Elizabeth Taylor, Carolina Herrera and Joan Collins, but is taking it into the present," she told People. "That whole period of time was wonderful but this will capture that but will also look contemporary and edgy. I‚Äôm bringing back the spirit in a new form after all these years. We will concentrate on bridal wear and evening wear‚Äîthings to get dressed up in, pieces that are handcrafted and made to order." The first collection from Emanuel Mayfair is expected to debut in July or September. 
 The actress helped 11 Honor√© make a memorable New York Fashion Week debut.  It's time for another season of New York Fashion Week and to start things off on a high note, Laverne Cox delivered one of the most extra and epic runway walks of all time. The actress served as the grand finale to 11 Honor√©'s runway show debut last night and grand it was.    Cox gave us twirls, sashays, hair flips, and dramatic poses up and down the entire length of the runway. The instantly iconic walk was then followed by a storm of silver confetti falling from the ceiling.   Now this is how you close a fashion show! @11honore set the bar high for the kickoff of #NYFW. @lavernecox in @zacposen A post shared by  Harper's BAZAAR (@harpersbazaarus) on Feb 6, 2019 at 3:59pm PST SHOP 11 HONOR√â NOW   WOW! Bravo to @11honore for a fabulous show featuring a parade of body positivity, diversity & fabulous fashion including @lavernecox in the finale. A post shared by  Mickey Boardman (@askmrmickey) on Feb 6, 2019 at 4:32pm PST  It was the cherry on top of an already stunning show that celebrated size inclusivity and diversity. And it was the first for 11 Honor√©, a luxury e-commerce site that offers designer fashion to women sizes 10 and up. At a time when many high fashion brands only offer up to a size 10 or 12, 11 Honor√© is looking to disrupt the market by better serving an entire market of women.   The site tapped celebrity stylist Elizabeth Stewart to style the show, which featured designs from brands like Zac Posen and Prabal Gurung. Along with Laverne Cox, a lineup of diverse models including Candice Huffine and Precious Lee walked the runway.  Huffine, who has been working with 11 Honor√© since its start, had the honors of opening the show in all white. "A show like this is a game changer and a hope creator and I think the energy it will bring to this week will change the landscape of fashion forever," she told BAZAAR.com.   I‚ÄôM EMOTIONAL. @11honore at #nyfw. Feels so good to see all these gorgeous humans sharing a runway. Omg. I was not expecting to tear up at this ‚Äî fashion still has a LONG way to go, but I feel so hopeful and so excited to see these changes and to be part of this conversation.

 "Don't ask if your dreams are crazy. Ask if they're crazy enough." Nike has unveiled a new video starring Colin Kaepernick for its "Just Do It" ad campaign honoring its 30th anniversary‚Äîand it'll reportedly play at the NFL season opener tomorrow. The two-minute video features the former NFL quarterback highlighting inspiring athletes, including superstars like LeBron James and Serena Williams and players who've overcome great adversity, like Alphonso Davies, a 17-year-old former refugee-turned-soccer star, and Shaquem Griffin, a one-handed linebacker who was just drafted to the Seattle Seahawks.  ‚ÄúIf people say your dreams are crazy, if they laugh at what you think you can do, good. Stay that way. Because what nonbelievers fail to understand is that calling a dream crazy is not an insult; it‚Äôs a compliment," Kaepernick who has had a Nike deal since 2011, narrates over the montage.  "So don't ask if your dreams are crazy," he says at the end of the commercial. "Ask if they're crazy enough." The video arrives two days after Nike debuted a photo advertisement starring Kaepernick with the words: "Believe in something, even if it means sacrificing everything," alluding to his peaceful protests against police brutality and racial injustice where he knelt during the national anthem at his games.   Believe in something, even if it means sacrificing everything. #JustDoIt A post shared by  colin kaepernick (@kaepernick7) on Sep 3, 2018 at 12:20pm PDT The black-and-white imagery garnered divided responses on social media. While many praised the campaign, some conservatives responded by destroying their Nike gear or calling for a boycott on the brand. Despite the backlash, Nike shares are still "up a bit" as of Wednesday, after falling 3 percent the day before, Bloomberg reports. The sportswear giant is still up about 28 percent this year. Kaepernick has not played for an NFL team since 2016, but you might still see him on TV during the upcoming season opener. ESPN reports that Nike's new ad will air when the Atlanta Falcons play the Philadelphia Eagles on Thursday night.   Nike is the official supplier of NFL uniforms until 2018, Washington Post reports.
 This will mark her third time gracing the VS runway. As models started revealing that they were cast in this year's Victoria's Secret Fashion Show, Gigi Hadid kept quiet, leaving some fans wondering whether the It girl would appear on the VS catwalk at all. But it seems the 22-year-old wasn't rejected from the lineup; she was just keeping her casting a secret. The model was seen entering Victoria's Secret's NYC offices on Monday for her fitting. (VS models have been going in for fittings since the weekend, and will continue to until Wednesday week.) Not long after the paparazzi pictures surfaced and fans started congratulating her on social media, Hadid confirmed the rumors herself on Instagram. She broke the news with a cute boomerang of her trying on her strappy black look from last year's fitting.  Forever and ever and ever a dream come true to be asked back to the VS Show !!! üôåüèº Thank you my friends @ed_razek @10magazine @johndavidpfeiffer @monica.mitro for another unforgettable opportunity; every aspect makes me feel like a dreaming kid again üïäüïäüñ§ (as shown here at last year's fitting, by @jeromeduran)! ‚òÅÔ∏è @victoriassecret #VSFS2017 A post shared by  Gigi Hadid (@gigihadid) on Aug 28, 2017 at 12:05pm PDT She wrote in her caption: Gigi's announcement comes just two days after her sister Bella also confirmed she'll be returning for this year's VS fashion show as well.  @victoriassecret I am so excited!..!!!!Thank you @monica.mitro @10magazine @johndavidpfeiffer and of course the wonderful, incredible @ed_razek + everyone on the team for making this dream come true again..

 Don‚Äôt let outfit planning kill your holiday high. Your packing list, right this way.  You've chosen a locale and booked your ticket, but between now and paradise is the packing process. Dressing for fun in the sun? That's easy enough. But when you factor in outfits for an al fresco dinner, a stroll through the city center, and a drink (or two) at the local bar, things become a little more overwhelming. Your options: Sit there indecisively overlooking a mound of clothes, or follow this vacation style guide (packed with on-trend pieces curated by Macy's The Edit) and thrive at the beach, pool, or wherever else you end up. Plus, you'll have plenty of quality Instagram vacation content.  What to Wear: To the Beach While a bathing suit is typically an essential part of any beach ensemble, you can leave the bikini at home if you're not planning to lay out or swim. Instead, let your accessories steal the spotlight. A lightweight hat adds instant impact to any look, while protecting you from UV rays. Pair the oversize brim with a body-hugging crop top and a high-waisted midi-skirt for a look that'll make you stand out in sea of swimsuit sameness.   INC skirt, $80 Shop Now Nine West hat, $36  SHOP NOW California Waves top, $20 Shop Now What to Wear: For a Pool Party Cover-ups are child‚Äôs play. To make a real splash, pair a printed one-piece with high-waisted trousers that crop just at the ankle. You won‚Äôt be swimming in sweat so long as you keep it airy with lightweight white pants (these come with a Hamptons-friendly feel). Just don‚Äôt forget a structured wicker bag, the unofficial token of a fashion-forward vacay.

A sleeved maxi dress is as utilitarian as they come. That said, it‚Äôs not your style to blend in too much. Opt for a tie-dye iteration in a vibrant hue for an eye-catching ensemble. Pair it with leather strapped sandals, and let yourself wander from your travel companions. Don't worry; they‚Äôll find you.   INC dress, $100 Shop Now Donald Pliner sandals, $135 Shop Now What to Wear: To Get Cocktails The nighttime look can get quite complicated, but you‚Äôre on vacation‚Äîleave any wardrobe worries at home and keep it simple with a silky wrap dress. It‚Äôs equal parts sexy and sophisticated, and most importantly, it‚Äôs easy and barely takes up any luggage space. Dress it down with comfortable sneakers or up with dainty jewelry and wrap-around sandals.

Sure, a new experience and fresh surroundings may call for a digital detox, but first, a really great outfit must be shared.  Boost likes with a sophisticated, floral-print set. A sliver of exposed skin between a bustier-style crop top and its matching high-waisted body-con skirt provides a subtle allure, especially when worn in front of the prerequisite white wall or infinity pool. Angular sunglasses and an oversize hat complete the picture.

The color exudes a carefree, fresh feel that complements just about any scenic locale, whether it be a Mediterranean backdrop, the deck of a yacht, or a candlelit dinner.  The trick to bringing this very simple piece to life lives in textures: Fringe trim, knit patterns, sheer layers, or, ideally, some sort of combo elevate the look without losing its effortless vibe. Wear it with color-blocked sandals‚Äîand a sun-kissed glow‚Äîfor a minimalist but powerful effect.  INC dress, $120 Shop Now INC earrings, $12 Shop Now Nine West heels, $70 Shop Now
 The 60-year-old actress and founder of clean fragrance line Henry Rose exudes effortless cool.  My personal style is old hippie meets classic design. The designers I wear most combine the two in varying degrees. I adore a woman in a great suit. In my closet, I have suits from Saint Laurent and Alexander McQueen, and a new white Armani that I love! I have quite a selection of Birkenstocks. I also wear boots all summer long, like Stevie Nicks. My favorite accessory is hoop earrings. I‚Äôve worn them since I was 12 years old. The biggest splurge in my wardrobe is a Brunello Cucinelli coat. It‚Äôs very extravagant but so timeless, and I‚Äôll wear it forever. I founded Henry Rose because I wanted to create a line of fine fragrances that didn‚Äôt compromise quality for safety. My interest in ‚Äúclean beauty‚Äù started when I became a new mother. Prior to that I always assumed that if a product was on our shelves it must be regulated. It seems common sense, that ingredients should be proven safe before they go onto our skin. Eventually I found the [nonprofit] Environmental Working Group‚Äôs cosmetic database, Skin Deep, which grades beauty products based on transparency, manufacturing practices, and quality of ingredients. (I‚Äôm now an EWG board member.) As I researched items, the ingredient ‚Äúfragrance‚Äù would pop up over and over again, and the EWG would always give it a negative score. I started looking for fragrance free products and actually stopped wearing perfume for 10 years because of it. My collection is both EWG Verified and Cradle to Cradle Certified, so it‚Äôs fully vetted‚ÄîI wanted to raise the bar.  As we were formulating the perfumes, the smells kept bringing me back to my childhood memories involving scent. Without realizing it at the time, I was trying to capture my father‚Äôs cologne in the first fragrance, Torn. It‚Äôs also the one that‚Äôs geared toward my taste. Another beauty essential is my Beautycounter concealer pen. I always have one on me.  I just started Michelle Obama‚Äôs book. I‚Äôm also reading 21 Lessons for the 21st Century, by Yuval Noah Harari. My bucket list includes a visit to the Blue Zones. I‚Äôd like to take a one-month break from all electronics.

 Lauren became the first American fashion designer to receive the prestigious honor.  Making history, Ralph Lauren became the first American designer to receive an Honorary Knighthood of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (KBE) for his services to fashion today. The designer was presented the honor by Prince Charles in a private ceremony at Buckingham Palace.  Mr. Lauren joins the ranks of other notable Americans, including former Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower, Ronald Reagan, and George H.W. Bush, Angelina Jolie, Steven Spielberg, Bill and Melinda Gates, in receiving the prestigious KBE. Just last month, BAZAAR's editor-in-chief Glenda Bailey was also presented with the accolade.  The news of Lauren's knighthood first broke in November 2018, following a milestone year for the designer who celebrated the 50th anniversary of his eponymous fashion brand with a star-studded runway show and bash.  
 Along with his five-decade career in fashion (in which he has dressed royals including Princess Diana, Kate Middleton, and Meghan Markle), Lauren has also made strides with his philanthropic work both in the U.S. and the U.K.  For years, the Ralph Lauren Corporation has worked towards helping cancer patients and funding cancer research by establishing the NinaHyde Center for Breast Cancer Research at Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center and the Ralph Lauren Center for Cancer Care in Harlem, New York. In London, the fashion brand helped fund The Ralph Lauren Centre for Breast Cancer Research, which opened at The Royal Marsden in 2016.  This is just the latest in the designer's long list of accolades. Previously, he's won CFDA Awards for Womenswear and Menswear Designer of the Year, Retailer of the Year, the prestigious Lifetime Achievement Award, and the CFDA‚Äôs first-ever American Fashion Legend Award. Across the pond, he's been recognized for his Outstanding Achievement by the British Fashion Council at the British Fashion Awards.
 Proceeds from the sexy workout-infused calendar go to a good cause.  Helping us all stick to our inevitable New Years Resolution of working out more, CR Fashion Book is debuting its first ever calendar of all your favorite models hitting the gym for 2018.  The ultra-sexy fitness-infused calendar, dubbed "CR GIRLS 2018," features Gigi Hadid, Joan Smalls, Grace Elizabeth, Hailey Clauson, Paris Jackson, Hoyeon Jung, Binx Walton, Eniko Mihalik, Hannah Ferguson, Joelle Lombardi, Danielle Herrington, Halima Aden and Candice Swanepoel working out at Technogym. Photographed by Steven Klein, each month's photo celebrates strong and sexy women hitting the gym in lingerie and high fashion, as one does.  "Throughout my career, I have championed diversity of both race and body type. This casting includes both iconic supermodels and fresh faces in a modern representation of beauty and body. It's about the multiplicity of woman in the year 2018," Carine Roitfeld said on directing CR Fashion Book's first calendar.  Models showcasing their strengths seems to be an ongoing theme for the end of year, as Love Magazine's current advent calendar video series also features models completing various workouts. Standing out from the pack, however, the CR Girls 2018 calendar has a charitable component to it and will be donating all proceeds from sales to the Special Olympics.  The idea for teaming up with the non-profit organization came from Roitfeld herself, who was inspired by her visually impaired personal trainer. "I am in awe of any person who devotes their mind and body to athletics, but especially those with disabilities. This is the definition of courage. I am pleased the proceeds of this calendar support the Special Olympics‚Äîan organization I greatly respect‚Äîand to promote the visibility of its efforts,‚Äù Roitfeld said in a statement. A sexy calendar for a good cause? Count us in. Take a sneak peek at some of the images below.

 The street style star teamed up with Westward Leaning for a line of sunglasses that gives back. Ultra tiny, '90s-inspired frames have been the It sunglasses of choice for quite some time now. But good news for those ready to move on from The Matrix remake: oversized (or actually, just normal-sized) sunglasses are climbing their way back to the top. And just in time, Olivia Palermo has a new collection of the perfect-sized frames you'll want to turn to next.  The street style star, who's always mastered the art of a good pair of sunnies, teamed up with Westward Leaning to design a collection of her own. Marking her third collaboration with the brand, Palermo's latest design project features 13 pairs of sunglasses that range from classic all-black styles to bold color palettes.  While attending New York and Paris Fashion Weeks, Palermo debuted some of the new frames with her street style looks. Amongst the collection, a pair of bold navy blue and white glasses, which she matched to a patchwork suede jacket, stood out from the pack. All of the styles range from $235-$285.  Much like all of Westward Leaning's design collaborations, the Olivia Palermo collection will donate a portion of proceeds to a charity cause. Palermo selected Dress for Success, a non-profit organization that provides professional attire and resources to low-income women around the world. Ten percent of profits from the Olivia Palermo x Westward Leaning collection will be donated to the cause.

 The move is sure to polarize fans of the fashion house.  Earlier this year it was announced that Hedi Slimane would be succeeding Phoebe Philo as the creative director of C√©line, and it's clear that some major changes are afoot at the fashion house. Following in the footsteps of celebrities like Taylor Swift and Blake Lively, C√©line deleted its entire Instagram account this weekend to reveal its new logo. Now that Slimane has taken over as the brand's artistic, creative, and image director, C√©line is heading in a new direction, and its starting with that inimitable name. Most notably, the new C√©line under Slimane comes with one key difference‚Äîthe accent on the √© has been erased, making the brand simply Celine.    In many ways, the loss of C√©line's accent is akin to the rebrand that Slimane instigated at Yves Saint Laurent, changing the fashion house's name to simply Saint Laurent. It appears as though Slimane is keen to create a cleaner and simpler aesthetic with his rebranded Celine, which is likely to polarize fans.  As Celine's Instagram account announces (translated from the French), "The accent on the 'e' has been removed to enable a simplified and more balanced proportion, evoking the Celine collections of the 1960s where the accent wasn't used often." Lady Gaga has already endorsed the brand's redesign, by carrying Hedi Slimane's first Celine bag in Paris, and posting about it all over Instagram. Personalized with her initials, it's thought that the design will hit the runway at Paris Fashion Week later this month, when Slimane debuts his inaugural collection for the brand.   As for what Celine's first three Instagram posts, which all feature gold, glittering fabric, mean for the brand, that remains to be seen:  
 The plot may be problematic but the fashion was fire... Pretty Woman hit theaters in 1990, so although it's cast as a seminal '90s film, its fashion is still decidedly late '80s. From brown polka dots at a polo match to a short sleeved bold shouldered white dress for a day of shopping (or not shopping as the case may be, haters gonna hate), it's almost shocking how stylistically relevant a nearly 30-year old film can feel. The plot of Pretty Woman might be problematic‚Äîis it really uplifting to watch a movie about a West Hollywood sex worker finding love with the dapper businessman who hired her off a street corner?‚Äîbut the fashion was fire.    And Vivian's looks are enjoying repeat performances for the summer of 2018‚Äîfrom white dots on a brown maillot to those statement button dresses. But the most famous dress, a red gown in the spirit of Valentino, designed by film costumer Marilyn Vance, can now too can be yours‚Äîfor under $400, thanks to Reformation's wedding collection. A sculptural column dress with a plunging sweetheart neckline and off-the-shoulder detail, it was an instant hit then and still packs a stylish punch now. That diamond necklace isn't included, but if we recall correctly it was borrowed from a jewelry store‚Äîway to cheap out, Edward.  In 2018, Viv would buy her own diamonds anyway, and her own dress from an eco-friendly brand like Reformation and most likely volunteer at an organization dedicated to ending human trafficking. But she'd still have a saucy best friend, because everyone needs a saucy best friend, but no one needs to be Cinder-f*cking-rella in the #MeToo era.

 All of the chicest looks on the European streets, shot by Tyler Joe.  See the best-dressed take on the summer streets during Copenhagen's Spring 2018 Fashion Week. 
 The show marked Herrera's last bow before stepping down as creative director.  Last week, Carolina Herrera announced she would be stepping down as creative director of her eponymous fashion house after 37 years. Before passing the reins over to her successor, Wes Gordon, the designer took her final bow at New York Fashion Week last night. For her last collection, Herrera ended her four-decade design career with a colorful rendition of her signature look. Every model walking in the finale wore a crisp white button-down shirt with a taffeta skirt and contrasting wide belt. From vibrant yellow to royal blue and emerald green, the designer's swan song of colors was a bright, breathtaking ode to the trademark look she defined over the years.   The timeless elegance of @HouseofHerrera üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªBrava üß°üíô‚ù§Ô∏èüíö pic.twitter.com/CAm5EdBOYY  The most gorgeous tribute to Carolina Herrera tonight on her last bow at @carolinaherrera. Congratulations, epic lady. A post shared by  Laura Brown (@laurabrown99) on Feb 12, 2018 at 5:55pm PST  Much like the finale, the Fall 2018 collection was filled with rich colors and vibrant patterns in the form of elegant dresses, skirts, blouses and outerwear. From a bright yellow coat with a white and black leopard fur collar to jaguar-printed dresses, the lineup was filled with statement-making looks for the modern-day woman. At the end of the show, Herrera opted to take her final bow on the runway alongside the men and women who work in her atelier. Shortly after, she was presented with a bouquet of red roses from her successor.   Moving forward, Herrera will transition her role with her brand to global ambassador‚Äîattending events, store openings and more across the world‚Äîas Gordon takes over as creative director. Much like her entire career, Herrera's final New York Fashion Week bow was full of elegance and grace‚Äîas if we'd expected anything less.
 Cara Delevingne shows us another side of Kendall Jenner, the world‚Äôs most in-demand supermodel.  CARA DELEVINGNE: Happy belated birthday! You recently turned the ripe old age of 22. How old do you really feel? KENDALL JENNER: It fluctuates. Sometimes I feel like a complete kid when I‚Äôm running around with my friends being stupid for a week, and then sometimes I just want to sit in my house and sip tea and watch old movies like I‚Äôm 60. CD: Sounds about right. Every time we‚Äôre together we‚Äôre either rolling around making bird noises or sitting on the porch in rocking chairs talking about the young people these days. Do you feel like an accomplished 22-year-old? KJ: I feel like the life I live is extraordinary in a lot of ways but that it also comes with a lot of responsibilities. I‚Äôve had to grow up pretty fast and deal with situations most 22-year-olds aren‚Äôt really put into. There are days and weeks and months when you just don‚Äôt stop.   CD: The pressure can be crushing sometimes. KJ: It can! And you know me and how OCD I can get over the littlest things. If something isn‚Äôt going the way I planned, I freak out. Some days I just want to go live on a farm and not talk to anyone and just exist in the middle of nowhere. CD: What sorts of animals would you have? KJ: On my farm? I would literally have tons. I‚Äôd have seven horses because I feel like that‚Äôs a reasonable amount of horses to love and take care of, and sheep and goats and chickens and dogs‚Äîlike, 10 dogs. But no cats because I‚Äôm not a cat person, unless they‚Äôre Savannah cats, which are like little cheetahs. CD: I want one so bad. KJ: They‚Äôre so good. Sorry, I got really excited about that question. CD: You‚Äôve really thought this farm thing through! You grew up in the public eye. Is there anything you feel you missed out on? KJ: The obvious answer is college, I guess, but I don‚Äôt even know if I regret that. I had a pretty normal childhood, with a twist, and went to school until the 10th grade. For 11th and 12th, I did homeschool, but I still saw a lot of my old friends. I didn‚Äôt go to prom, though, which was kind of annoying. I can‚Äôt really complain except for now, maybe, I would like to go to Disneyland or a public beach. To go to a beach in peace would be lovely. To be able to hang out and meet new people and not be bothered would be awesome. CD: When you have children‚Äîbecause I know you‚Äôre going to have loads‚Äîhow will you feel if one of them wants to go into fashion and become famous like their mom? Will you let them have access to social media? KJ: I think I‚Äôll definitely put an age limit on it and try to keep them away from it as much as possible. I always loved being able to play in my yard with my animals, and my dog, and my friends. It‚Äôs going to be interesting to see what the world is like when I do have kids. But I definitely don‚Äôt plan on having them anytime soon. CD: Bringing kids into the world is a scary thought right now, isn‚Äôt it? KJ: It‚Äôs super scary. CD: We have to make sure we have ours at the same time so they can look after each other. What in particular keeps you up at night? ‚ÄúI'm not afraid to try something even if I know no one will like it.‚Äù KJ: It‚Äôs funny you ask that because I have such debilitating anxiety because of everything going on that I literally wake up in the middle of the night with full-on panic attacks. Where do I even start? Everything is so horrible, it‚Äôs hard to name one thing. I just think that the world needs so much love. I wish I had the power to send Cupid around the planet, as cheesy as that sounds. You go online and you see everyone saying the worst things to each other, and it‚Äôs hard to stay positive. It‚Äôs hard not to get eaten alive by all the negativity.  CD: What does it mean to be a supermodel today versus 20 years ago? KJ: I‚Äôve actually talked about it with a couple of women, like Cindy Crawford, who have been doing this for a long time. I feel like social media obviously has a lot to do with how it‚Äôs different. A lot of people are like, ‚ÄúOh, it‚Äôs so much easier now because you have Instagram. You don‚Äôt even need an agency anymore.‚Äù But that‚Äôs just not true. I still had to go to all the castings, I still had to go meet all the photographers, I still had to do all of that to get to where I am now. There wasn‚Äôt a step taken out just because I had social media. I still have 12-hour days, I still have even 24-hour days sometimes; I still have to do all those things. We don‚Äôt work any less hard than the ‚Äô90s models did when they were young. CD: Social media is an interesting beast. When you have more than 85 million Instagram followers, you get a lot of attention you might not want. How do you keep from becoming jaded? KJ: Lately I‚Äôve just tried to stay off it, and I definitely don‚Äôt look at comments. I think Instagram is still a fun place for the most part. I like going on and seeing what people are up to, but I mostly follow stupid accounts with pictures of puppies and little baby animals and people saving animals. Forget about Twitter, which is so not fun these days. It just makes me sad. CD: It‚Äôs true. Even if you go on for, like, a minute, you know you‚Äôre going to read something horrible, either about yourself or about the world. KJ: I‚Äôm not even worried about myself anymore at this point. [Laughs] CD: From what I‚Äôve seen of your friends, you hang out with an incredibly creative, crazy group of people who are doing their own thing and don‚Äôt seem to care what other people think about them. Has that rubbed off on you a bit? You seem to be taking more fashion risks. KJ: It has. I think, for sure, being in the fashion industry and having so many friends who are into fashion‚Äîyoung people who would die for it‚Äîinspires me to try and push the boundaries. I‚Äôm not afraid to try something even if I know no one will like it. CD: Who‚Äôs a friend who inspires you? KJ: Tyler [the Creator] really inspires me. He‚Äôs so determined to do anything he thinks is amazing. He just opened a new store on Fairfax in L.A., and he put out an incredible album last summer, and now he‚Äôs on tour. Whatever he wants to do, he just does it, and in the coolest, best way. I like people who push the limits of what‚Äôs expected. Even you, bro! You‚Äôre fucking inspiring. ‚ÄúI like people who push the limits of what's expected.‚Äù CD: Ha! KJ: No, for real! You‚Äôre out here killing it, doing movies because you feel like it. I want to be like you, I want to be like Tyler, I want to be like all my friends. CD: Would you ever consider designing your own line? KJ: Kylie and I have our little brand that we do together, and actually have a fun time doing it, but I would love to branch off and do something a little more serious and really sit down and test my brain and play with it a little bit. CD: Every time I come to your house, you always have a new artwork hanging. Is that something you‚Äôre exploring?   KJ: Most people don‚Äôt know this about me, but I have a real love for interior design. I‚Äôve been working with a designer named Martyn Bullard who‚Äôs really awesome and who kind of made me fall in love with art. Kanye has also been a huge influence. He‚Äôs really, really into art and has the sickest pieces in his house. CD: What do you hope to be doing 22 years from now? KJ: I hope to have a family, and I hope to be in love. I just want light and happiness and love. And you! I want you in my life! CD: Hopefully some of that love will reach the people who are feeling so much hate in the world right now. KJ: I hope so. I‚Äôll keep sending out vibes.  This article originally appears in the February issue of Harper's Bazaar, available on newsstands January 23.

 "The world is pretty divisive right now," the fashion mogul tells BAZAAR.com.  Tory Burch may be one of the most recognized names in fashion, but when she started her company 14 years ago, investors "repeatedly" told her she'd fail. That negativity, she tells BAZAAR.com, only fueled her entrepreneurial spirit and determination to succeed. Today, she's the CEO of her multibillion dollar fashion empire and the genius behind the Tory Burch Foundation, an organization providing resources to empower female entrepreneurs.  Burch's unrelenting ambition and drive were the core themes of  Embrace Ambition Summit on April 24, which was hosted by her foundation. For the event, she gathered an impressive number of like-minded models, activists, politicians, and celebrities at Lincoln Center in New York City to celebrate similar initiative and to confront stereotypes in the workplace.  Featured attendees included journalist Katie Couric, Joe Kennedy III, Congressman (D-MA), #1000BlackGirlBooks founder Marley Dias, actress Yara Shahidi, writer Margaret Atwood, and Olympic medalists Ibtihaj Muhammad and Lindsey Vonn. "We wanted to make sure it was authentic," Burch says after the successful event. "It was a bit of a risk, taking on such big subjects like ambition, and the world is pretty divisive right now, so we wanted to handle everything in a direct and honest way, but also carefully." For men, ambition is perceived a positive quality. The same can't always be said for women. Here, Burch opens up about confronting that stereotype when she started her own career, fashion's responsibility in the #MeToo era, and the success of her inaugural Summit.  It was our first summit and to [talk] about ambition, stereotype, and bias is quite big. So it became how do we tackle those issues in a way that is accessible to women and men and isn't political, but more about humanity. We really challenged ourselves to have things that were actionable and to take away from the summit to create change.  It was inspiring on so many levels, [especially] because of the people that spoke like Yara Shahidi and Margaret Atwood. I think the fact that we had Joe Kennedy and Kevin McCarthy was important. Obviously, with everything happening in the world today, to have two incredible representatives on the same stage was an important message of what we need to do to start bringing this country together.   An incredible day at the #EmbraceAmbition Summit with leaders who are confronting stereotypes and empowering women‚Ä¶ Thank you to everyone who joined us in NYC or tuned into the livestream! @toryburchfoundation A post shared by  Tory Burch (@toryburch) on Apr 24, 2018 at 7:58pm PDT I grew up with three brothers and my parents raised me to think I could do anything equally with them, as long as I put my mind to it and worked incredibly hard. I didn‚Äôt realize there would be a difference from a gender standpoint, in the workforce and in what people could achieve. Fast forward, I worked at many different places‚Äîincluding Harper‚Äôs Bazaar‚Äîand there was some wonderful experiences, but when I started my own company 14 years ago, there were many people with different points of views.  There were naysayers who said I wouldn‚Äôt be able to [build a successful company]. I had people asking why would you start an e-commerce site when no one will buy stuff online? Or, why would you start with a retail concept? It won't work. That went went on and on. My parents told me to think of the negativity as noise.  I remember my first meeting with potential investors, I walked them through the whole business plan and at the heart of the business plan was a plan to build a global lifestyle brand so that I could start a foundation for women. Certainly, there was a ton of pushback from the men in the room saying that business and social responsibility should not go hand in hand. That just made me more determined.  I love a suit... wearing our SS18 Anna ruffle top and moleskin suit, coming this fall A post shared by  Tory Burch (@toryburch) on Apr 19, 2018 at 4:38am PDT It‚Äôs incredible to me that 55 years after the Equal Pay Act, women still don‚Äôt have parity with men and the gap is obviously wider with women of color, so I think... equal pay should not be a favor, it should be a given, and countless studies also prove that equal pay for women would add billions of dollars to the economy, so it‚Äôs a win for everyone. Studies have also shown that companies with women in leadership positions [offer] a different and important perspective. To not have women on boards and involved in leadership teams is a miss from a business standpoint. They‚Äôre more collaborative and, this is obviously a big sweeping generalization, but in general they are patient.   It's hard to say all women, but you know I [can speak for myself as a leader], I‚Äôm a good listener and I think that I try to balance conversations. I want to create an environment that‚Äôs really focused on culture. I think men are great at that too, depending on the company, but it‚Äôs very important to have a woman‚Äôs perspective.   With my mother, Reva, during a summer camp visit #ToMomwithLove A post shared by  Tory Burch (@toryburch) on Apr 28, 2018 at 7:35am PDT Every leader and business has a role to ensure that bad behavior is stopped. It‚Äôs a new day and it‚Äôs an important one. Everyone has to play their part in ensuring that people have a safe place, a safe environment to work, and certainly their career path has nothing to do with anything but their talent.
 You'll want to book a trip after you see this capsule collection.  If there's one thing Colombian designer Silvia Tcherassi thinks people need to know about her home country, it's that the people highly value happiness and the simple things in life. In honor of the popular South American destination, luxury e-retailer  Net-a-Porter has launched the Colombian Collective, highlighting the best designers and inspired designs by the latin country. Alongside Barranquilla-born Tcherassi, who opened the door for a new wave of Colombian designers, Johanna Ortiz, Esteban Cortazar and Mercedes Salazar also joined in to design exclusive items that you're going to want to take on your next sunny getaway.

"To dress a room is like dressing a body," Tcherassi told BAZAAR.

 From Bond girls to Blue Crush and non-cinematic moments in between, see which swimsuits were having a moment the year you were born.  The bathing suit is reflective of the era in more ways than style‚Äîwere women expected to be more covered up? Was the economy booming or busting? A simple one piece or flashy bikini can tell the tale. From Bond girls to Blue Crush and non-cinematic moments in between, see which swimsuits were having a moment the year you were born.  Jane Russell was one of America's first major sex symbols. The actress proved that a covered up one-piece could pack a curvy punch in the more Puritanical mid-50s. The bikini began to emerge in the late 50s, seen here in the South of France. It was originally invented by Louis R√©ard in 1946, but wasn't widely embraced until much later. Elizabeth Taylor stole the show in the film Suddenly, Last Summer with this somewhat baggy white maillot. The relaxed look was a step away from the perfectly coiffed '50s into the looser 1960s. This gorgeous Slim Aarons photo illustrates the low-slung bikini bottom style of the early 1960s, paired with a strapless top. Consider it a bikini with structure. A more tailored suit continued to reign as the 1960s went on. A smart woven hat made for the perfect accessory. Raquel Welch has one of the most famous figures ever in cinema. This halter style two-piece and Barbarella-esque hair showcases the over-the-top mood of the moment. Iconic actress Sophia Loren wore a super sexy lingerie bikini set in the Italian film  Marriage Italian Style.  Sally Field as Gidget was the ultimate surf girl. The sweet pink hue of her suit and pigtails in her hair illustrate the good girl vibe of the mid '60s. Bathing suits were merging with fashion in the late '60s, exemplified in this photo of model Pauline Stone wearing a petal-embroidered strapless bikini layered under a sheer wide-lapel tunic. Jane Birkin wore a barely there bikini with a delicate gold necklace, signifying the end of the big-haired '60s and a move into the more natural, bohemian 1970s. This little gingham two-piece doesn't have the structure of earlier bikinis. It's meant to move with the body and showcased an ease that women were beginning to have in the early '70s. The original Foxy Brown Pam Grier wore major sunnies and a crocheted bikini top. The look in swim mirrored the look in fashion, which was all about natural fabrics and a less-is-more approach. Jackie O was never one for anything too bohemian. This photo of her on a boat in a white headscarf and tied black bikini showcases a more streamlined mid-70s vibe. In one of the most famous bathing suit photos of all time, Farrah Fawcett set off a trend in plunging one-piece halters with little to no lining. Baja blankets were optional. Princess Caroline of Monaco is seen here in a white maillot with tie details on the sides. This peek-a-boo style set the tone for the time with its striking elegance and ease. Bo Derek made waves in the film 10 for her flesh-colored swimsuit that left little to the imagination. The late '70s were still about a naturalism in style‚Äîand a good tan. The early 1980s were not yet about over-the-top glamour. Margaux Hemingway wore a simple black one-piece here with slicked-back hair that is timeless. Phoebe Cates influenced a generation of young women in this standout red bikini. No one ever thought about exiting a pool the same way ever again. The teeny bikini look continued on into the 1980s, when simple designs were still in style. "The smaller the better" remained the edict of the time. In current vernacular, the look in swim in 1986 was "extra." Cut super high on the leg, with an open back and low top was the norm. You might throw on a headband to finish the idea.  Goldie Hawn in Overboard was the pivotal look in 1987‚Äîin other words look as rich and over-the-top as possible, especially in a swimsuit. Wall Street was on the rise and so was wearing as much gold at once as possible. Nicolette Sheridan proved that a dramatic high rise bottom continued as the '80s wore on. A floral print in primary hues was all the rage.  Helmut Lang was the of-the-moment designer in 1990s. This minimal suit on Helena Christensen with a boy short bottom and bandeau top from the runway signified a new era. The early '90s and Saved by the Bell were all about bold neons and graphic prints. California surf culture was all the rage.  With a continued trend towards Southern California cool, Baywatch-style set the tone in the mid-90s with its high-cut red one-pieces. Having curves and showing them off were in. Belly chains, studding, and barely-there bikinis signified a new look in 1994. While minimalism was embraced by some at this time, others were all about the glam factor. Grunge made its way to swim in muted tones and oversized bottoms. Bandeau tops were everywhere and so was Kate Moss naturalism. This Salma Hayek swim moment in From Dusk Til Dawn showed that padding was moving into bikini tops and high slung bottoms still had a place in swimwear. Subtlety wasn't for everyone in the '90s. A one-shouldered maillot with three colors was indicative of the swim look in the late 1990s. Cut-outs and a simple cool factor reigned. 1999 was all about Gisele, polka dots, belly rings and a golden tan. This ultra-low skirt was the ideal cover up at the time.
 Actor, model, and charity founder Mari Malek wants every child to have an education.  ‚ÄúMy heart and my soul‚Äôs mission is really to be a humanitarian,‚Äù says Mari Malek, the model, actor, DJ, and founder of the non-profit Stand 4 Education. Malek grew up in war-torn South Sudan and came to the United States as a refugee. Now, she uses her profile to raise money to build schools and advocate for girls in her native country, and around the world. Tall and lithe, with jutting cheekbones, luminous skin, and expressive features, Malek was scouted several times in her teens, but she waited until she was 22 before she started modeling in New York City. At first, she encountered racism. When rejecting her, some agencies said she didn‚Äôt have a ‚Äúsellable look,‚Äù or told her, ‚ÄúWe already have a black girl.‚Äù Before Malek hit it big and started shooting with photographers like Steven Meisel, she was sometimes turned away at castings with a cursory, ‚ÄúNo black girls.‚Äù ‚ÄúBeing the dark skin that I am, I went through so many uncomfortable moments,‚Äù says Malek, reclining on a couch at the Long Island City studio where she is working on this hot summer day. ‚ÄúI had to break a lot of doors open. Long story short, representation matters, and just because someone says that something doesn't sell, doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs the truth.‚Äù "We're facing the worst migrant and refugee crisis in the world right now." Growing up during the long Sudanese civil war, which eventually resulted in South Sudan gaining its independence in 2011, Malek never saw fashion magazines or luxury goods, but she recognized that modeling could be a path to self-sufficiency, and to a platform. ‚ÄúModeling was a blessing, a chance for me to put my country on the map, and to tell the stories of the women and children that need help,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúAnd the main thing that we need is education.‚Äù That conviction is what led Malek to found her charity. In the last year of the Obama administration, she was highlighted for her humanitarian work at the White House Correspondents‚Äô Dinner, and met the Obamas at a small party. ‚ÄúI got to speak with Michelle about girls‚Äô empowerment, because she has that initiative called Let Girls Learn,‚Äù Malek recalls, beaming. Malek was born into a family of around 20 children in present-day South Sudan. Her father was a politician, and her mother, one of four wives, was a nurse. As the fighting worsened, Malek‚Äôs mother opened their home to displaced people fleeing the violence and destruction. At one point, militants invaded the family home and abducted her father. When Malek was eight, her mother escaped to Egypt with her and her two younger sisters. There, they lived in a refugee camp while their asylum claims were processed. Finally, in 1997, Malek‚Äôs family was allowed to come to the United States. The family initially settled in Newark, New Jersey before moving to San Diego to be with relatives. There, Malek finished high school and went on to college. TUMI Phoebe Backpack SHOP Decades of civil war has left South Sudan with a population that is disproportionately young ‚Äî the country‚Äôs median age is just 17.3 ‚Äî and female. But, says Malek, women and girls aren‚Äôt accorded equal respect or opportunity.  "Girls are not prioritized for education, or for just growing and finding themselves." ‚ÄúThe minute a girl menstruates, she's defined as a woman, and gets married off,‚Äù she says. Marriage usually means the end of a girl‚Äôs education, one reason why South Sudan has an adult female literacy rate of just 16%. ‚ÄúThe greatest challenge we‚Äôre facing today in South Sudan is the dis-empowerment of women,‚Äù says Malek. It‚Äôs this inequality that she wants most to address through Stand 4 Education. In addition to building schools, the organization pursues a larger mission of peace-building, providing life skills programs and menstrual health care. Malek says she also values art education, partly because she‚Äôs seen its impact on her own life. ‚ÄúArt for me has been therapy, especially as someone who has faced trauma and war,‚Äù she explains. Modeling led Malek first to music ‚Äî she deejays under the name DJ Stiletto ‚Äî and then to acting, which she finds liberating. She earned rave reviews for her performance in the 2017 Swedish indie thriller The Nile Hilton Incident, which was awarded the Grand Jury Prize for a world cinema drama at Sundance. In the film, Malek plays Saleh, a Sudanese refugee living in Egypt who is working as a hotel maid when she witnesses a political assassination and gets sucked into a web of intrigue. Malek has several upcoming film projects that she‚Äôs not yet ready to talk about publicly. Ultimately, she sees acting as a way to fulfill what she feels is her responsibility to be a voice for the voiceless. ‚ÄúI wanna tell our stories,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúStorytelling is powerful.‚Äù TUMI Bonnie Shield Bag SHOP Styled by Marina Munoz, Hair by Nicolas Eldin, Makeup by Tracy
 Saks Fifth Avenue's Fashion Director Roopal Patel on the must-buy items of the season‚Äîplus three unique ways to style them. Thirty-one days, dozens of shows, and five‚Äîor more‚Äîflights make up fashion month, and Saks Fifth Avenue's Fashion Director, Roopal Patel, is there to see it all (and decide what goes into Saks Fifth Avenue stores around the country). From Instagram accounts to inspirational travel, Patel looks at multiple outlets to decide just what is worth investing in each season. ‚ÄúTravel, modern day culture, and art inspire me,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI look to the streets and everyday activity to see how fashion can translate into daily life. I was recently in Cartagena and was so inspired by the architecture, color, sounds, and flavor of the city. All of these elements help shape some of the direction and translation of trends at Saks.‚Äù But how to wear them? For Spring 2018, Patel selected three pieces that are truly √† la mode, and styled them for three different occasions.  ‚ÄúTrench coats are no longer just for rainy days! This season we saw a focus on the waist and trench dressing. It really is a great go-to piece during these transitional months, and it's an iconic fashion piece. Khaite's trench coat is a chic take on the classic silhouette, and the brand has become a must for everyday, luxe essentials." Khaite trench, $1,690 SHOP ‚ÄúThe spring season is all about about getting dressed up. For evening, the trench coat becomes a chic layering piece  over a cocktail dress and sparkly accessories. Rosie Assoulin's dress is dreamy in shimmered tulle: just the right amount of sparkle  and sheer. I always like adding a bit of novelty with a bejeweled handbag and shoe." Rosie Assoulin dress, $2,595, saks.com; Alexander Wang bag, $695, saks.com ‚ÄúWe saw so many novelty versions of the trench on the Spring runways: classic, colored, checked, and fringe.

It's a basic that can be paired back with everything! It looks playful and easy with the sequined skirt here. The play of leathers and sequins is a bit unexpected. I like the edge of the leather jacket mixed with this feminine sequin skirt. Its tough-girl chic. These days, we are all on the go and need a little versatility for day to evening. We saw luxe activewear on the runways this season, and a chic white parka is a versatile investment piece. It tones down the sequin skirt‚Äîespecially if you pair it with white sneakers."

 Winter outfit inspiration from the best model street style.  Beyond Instagram and other forms of social media, the city streets are some of our favorite places to score outfit inspiration, especially when it comes from the best dressed off-duty models. From inspiring new ways to style your favorite chunky turtlenecks to unthought-of details and classic leather trouser pairings, these are the model street style looks we plan to copy this fall and winter.  Gigi and Bella Hadid are always at the forefront of every trend, runway show, and model off-duty shot we want to copy. A chunky turtleneck and cropped red puffer coat are winter essentials, and the Hadid's prove the staples look best when paired with uniquely detailed pants and boots. You can't go wrong with a chunky turtleneck, especially one that comes in this buttery off-white hue.¬† Breathe some new life into your winter wardrobe with this weather-resistant puffer, crafted in a fire engine red.¬† On and off the runway, Kendall Jenner serves looks. The best part? A lot of them can be recreated, like this sleek denim on denim ensemble she wore for the Milan Versace show.

These jeans are no exception.

This works for either a casual office ensemble or an off-duty weekend look.  Zadig & Voltaire make an animal print¬†iteration of the classic blazer that offers instant outfit enhancements with its bright hue and pattern. This easy, effortless black hoodie doubles as both a pre-workout cover up and an off-duty essential.¬† If there's one person we look to for cozy winter outfit inspiration, it's Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. With a penchant for oversized, loose and neutral separates, Rosie makes off-duty dressing easy.  We're obsessed with this Rag & Bone floppy wool fedora; perfect for cold-weather weekend styling, cabin getaways and brisk breezes.¬† Upcoming it-girl brand SheVoke crafts expertly made trendy and classic¬†sunglasses that can be worn all year round.¬†  Left church feeling these things...When God gives you a vision, run towards that vision. You may not know how it‚Äôs going to happen...but believe it will happen. You may feel lonely, but this is how you know you‚Äôre doing what you are called to do. Everyone partying with you is not celebrating you. And finally, a big one. God speaks to YOU. The individual. About YOUR LIFE. Listen and dreams unfold. üïä The best is yet to come ‚õ™Ô∏è A post shared by  TyLynn Nguyen ü¶¢ (@tylynnnguyen) on Sep 15, 2019 at 8:31pm PDT TyLynn's instagram is one of the most inspiring ones we've seen, ever. Her style is composed of off-duty separates, minimalist must-haves, and enviable accessories.  In this look, everything is pared-back but still makes a massive statement.  This cropped jacket speaks for itself. The balloon sleeves, Swedish-inspired construction, and relaxed shape make this a piece that'll elevate any skirt or denim pairings.¬† The 'ugly' shoe trend is still kicking, and there's nothing we love more than these camp-esque fisherman flats.¬† Supermodel and street style favorite Karlie Kloss never takes a flight without looking her best, all without sacrificing comfort. Her airport terminal look of an all-black ensemble, topped off with a neutral wool coat is an effortlessly chic formula to wear all winter long. A wardrobe classic with a twist;¬†Tot√™me's Pisa coat will survive season after season, and trend after trend.¬† Dress it up or dress is down, either way a black turtleneck will carry you through the coldest months.¬† For days off, look to easy separates that provide comfort and movement. Pair your favorite oversized longline coat with loose-fitting jeans and white sneakers √† la Gisele. Style this pretty power blue coat with anything from leather joggers to loose-fitting laid-back denim.¬† A staple closet essential; whether for office Fridays or weekends at the farmers market.¬† We can't discuss off-duty styling without mentioning Cindy Crawford. Known for her iconic work both on and off the runway, this supermodel (and now supermom) makes a leather jacket and vintage jeans look elevated and unfussy.   If it's chic enough for Cindy, it's chic enough for us. Wear your leather jacket with off-duty bottoms like vintage-inspired denim or cozy joggers.¬† The true blue options from Re/Done have a raw-hem and high-rise for a figure-flattering, vintage-inspired feel.¬†
 Hint: She loves Brazilian food and hates avoiding sweets. There are Victoria‚Äôs Secret models, and then there‚Äôs Adriana Lima. The leggy 36-year-old Brazilian is the lingerie giant‚Äôs longest-running spokeswoman and has held the coveted title of Angel for nearly two decades. More impressive are her stats: the top model made her runway debut at just 18, she‚Äôs worn a total of three Fantasy Bras worth $9 million combined, and she was named the most valuable face in the brand's history earlier this year. Even more awe-inspiring is the fact she opened her fifth VS show in 2012 less than two months after giving birth to her second daughter. Given all of that, it‚Äôs fair to say that Lima knows more than the average person about keeping her body in the best possible shape. Ahead of her travels to Shanghai later this month for the 2017 edition of the annual scantily-clad event, CR caught up with the OG-Angel for all her pearls of health and wellness wisdom. Can you remember how you felt before you walked your first Victoria‚Äôs Secret show in 1999? I was in total shock and completely scared, but everyone was so amazing. I remember looking around and seeing all of the Angels of that time like Heidi [Klum] and Tyra [Banks]. I must have really loved it, because here I am still! How do you feel about the event in Shanghai this year? I am always nervous before walking in any show. People are surprised to hear that, but I‚Äôm human, too. How far in advance did you start preparing for it? As a model I need to be ready all year long so I train consistently. For about two months leading up to VS every year, I train even harder and eat a little bit leaner. I also try not to eat too many sweets, but it‚Äôs really hard because they are my favorite thing.   Ohhh shit! GOOD MORNING WORLD! Time to kick ass mf üí™üèºüëäüèºüî•üí•#teamlima #verizon üî• A post shared by  Adriana Lima (@adrianalima) on Apr 1, 2017 at 4:33am PDT  What does your workout routine look like at the moment?  I‚Äôve been switching things up a little bit. I love boxing, but more recently I‚Äôve been doing a lot of circuit training and running. I've found that keeping fit on the road is really challenging. I always want to try new types of food that may not be all that healthy. The key to balancing this is keeping my body active. If I have a gym at my hotel, I'll wake up and do a quick workout, or I'll run outside as a way to see the place that I‚Äôm visiting. Another good trick of mine is packing a jumprope and doing ten minutes in my room first thing in the morning to get my heart rate up. What‚Äôs your in-flight routine? Depending on how long the flight is, I'll sleep, watch movies, snack on fruit and‚Äîmost importantly‚Äîdrink lots of water. To cure jet lag I try and get my body to adjust to the schedule of wherever I am in the world as soon as possible. What do you eat everyday to stay healthy? I love smoothies, fresh fruit, and veggies. I also take a daily vitamin and drink lots of different herbal teas to help purify my body. It doesn't bounce back the way it used after having kids, so I have to workout really hard to be in good shape in addition to being a tired mother. What advice would you give to other new moms trying to get in shape? Don‚Äôt be too hard on yourself and listen to your body‚Äîit will tell you when it‚Äôs ready to workout again. Work hard, but make sure not to deprive your body of necessary nutrients, because it‚Äôs really important to keep your energy up to hit the gym.  ITS SHOW TIME! ü¶Ñü¶Ñü¶Ñü¶Ñü¶Ñ A post shared by  Adriana Lima (@adrianalima) on Nov 30, 2016 at 7:46am PST What‚Äôs your greatest indulgence? I make a really good Brazilian dish called feijoada. I could eat Brazilian food forever, of course. Also, I love chocolate molten cake. I can‚Äôt get enough of it! Do you have any pre-show rituals? Not really. I just say a little prayer and hit the runway. After the show, I‚Äôll celebrate with lots of food and dancing with all of my other Angels.

 "Please know that things would have been different if my control of the situation was different." Gigi Hadid recently became the center of backlash after her new Vogue Italia cover appeared to show her with darkened skin. After the image‚Äîphotographed by Steven Klein‚Äîwas unveiled on social media yesterday, commenters pointed out that the 22-year-old model didn't look like herself, and some even accused the publication of blackface.   This afternoon, Hadid responded to the backlash with a message on social media. In a lengthy message, she pointed out the lack of creative control she had over the cover, apologized to those she offended, and urged the fashion industry to push for more diversity moving forward.  pic.twitter.com/MAYix18Wrk Read Gigi's message below in full:  Hadid shared her note with a paparazzi photo of herself from the day of the shoot, showing how bronzed she was when her photos were taken. She's covered up in a hoodie and hiding her face with her hand and a pair of sunglasses, but it's evident that her face looked bronzer than usual.

 The historically stylized place is now accepting reservations. Serial killer Andrew Cunanan murdered Gianni Versace on the front steps of the fashion designer's Miami Beach mansion in 1997, and now those stone steps provide the backdrop for dozens of tourist photos on a daily basis.  But not only can tourists (and fans of FX's upcoming American Crime Story miniseries, which focuses on the murder) photograph the house, they can stay there overnight. Scroll down for a look inside the boutique luxury hotel known as the Villa Casa Casuarina. In 1992, Versace purchased the original house for $2.95 million and the Revere Hotel next door for $3.7 million. He spent an astonishing $32 million on renovations that included demolishing the Revere to make way for a pool, garden, and new south wing of the home. The designer built an additional two suites in the south wing. Above, the Venus Suite, was where his sister Donatella Versace stayed. Rates for one-bedroom suites today start at $1,199 per night. In addition to the guestrooms, it operates the restaurant Gianni's, which "offers a delicious blend of Italian and Mediterranean food and wine selections." Decadent dishes include gnocchi di granchio, with New Orleans blue crab, vermouth wine, shallots, parmigiano-reggiano, truffles, and filetto di manzo rossini, with eight-ounce Wagyu filet mignon, pomme confit, grilled asparagus, pan-seared foie gras, and Bordelaise jus. Producer Ryan Murphy told the New York Post he couldn‚Äôt believe that he received permission to shoot the series there. "I don‚Äôt think I could have made the show if I couldn‚Äôt have gotten that house,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere was no way you could build [a set] of it. Two of the rooms were made out of seashells. [Gianni Versace‚Äôs sister] Donatella [Versace] took all the furniture and the art when she sold the house, but through pictures we were able to recreate them." "We actually have preserved what Versace created here and just augmented it with some modern touches for the convenience of our hotel guests and restaurant patrons," Chauncey Copeland, the hotel‚Äôs general manager, told the Associated Press.

 The dresses drop on the e-retailer's site today. For the first time ever, Diane von Furstenberg will be offering plus-sized clothing exclusively through online luxury retailer, 11 Honor√©. The partnership has produced DVF's most iconic and universally flattering style, the wrap dress, selling at $568 in three different prints pulled straight from the DVF archive. Feel flirty in bold hot pink floral, or amp your confidence for that Monday morning meeting in a retro-inspired black and white houndstooth pattern. And, if all else fails, you can always fall back on that trusted leopard print, which will surely get you kicking for some weekend drinks with your girlfriends. The dresses will come in sizes 14-24. It's an epoch-making moment for both the acclaimed Belgian fashion designer and the rapidly growing commerce site. Since its 2017 founding, 11 Honor√© has stamped a place for itself amongst luxury vendors and fashion houses, bringing size-inclusivity into the sartorial limelight. DVF, which was the most highly requested brand by 11 Honor√© buyers according to a spokesperson, is just the latest to join the inclusivity conversation. "For me, my number one objective and priority on a daily basis is just to provide the same options that straight size women have," said 11 Honor√© co-founder Patrick Herning while speaking to Forbes this past January. "And that‚Äôs really why I get out of bed everyday - pushing brands to go up in their sizing, bringing brands onto this platform, and evangelizing that this customer does exist. We have proven it." Other notable designers featured on 11 Honor√©'s site include Brandon Maxwell, Derek Lam, Marc Jacobs, Zac Posen, and Veronica Beard. After the Diane von Furstenberg launch, luxury pieces from Carolina Herrera, and GANNI are also expected to sell plus-sized pieces through the e-retailer. 
 Further proof that this supermodel is an absolute legend. Supermodel Naomi Campbell is a legend‚Äìplain and simple‚Äìbut the CFDA has decided to mark her iconic standing in fashion history. Today, the Council of Fashion Designers of America announced that Campbell will be the 2018 recipient of their Fashion Icon Award, The Cut reports. The honor will be awarded to Naomi on June 4th, at the CFDA Awards ceremony.  Campbell joins the ranks of her friends and famous faces that have received the same honor: Rihanna, Beyonc√©, David Bowie, Pharrell Williams and Kate Moss have all been declared CFDA "icons" in years past. And this year feels decidedly different for the council's annual award show, with streetwear designers nominated in both the menswear and womenswear categories. Virgil Abloh was nominated for both awards, and James Jebbia of Supreme was recognized alongside Abloh, Thom Browne, Tom Ford and Raf Simons for menswear. This year will feature the award show's first-ever female host, Issa Rae, and designers Diane Von Furstenberg, Narciso Rodriguez and Carolina Herrera will all receive nods for Positive Change, Lifetime Achievement and the Founder's Award respectively. In a year where she spent much time honoring the legacy of her brother, Gianni, Donatella Versace will receive the International Award. The ceremony will take place at the Brooklyn Museum this June, and will welcome the industry's top talent, CFDA board members and the celebrity guests of the nominees, all clad in their custom designs for the night. As for Naomi Campbell, we're hoping she shows up in an archive piece from Azzedine Ala√Øa, to honor the designer she considered a father figure, who passed away in late 2017. 
 The Comme Si founder talks building her accessory brand from scratch, and what she‚Äôs learned along the way.   In business as in fashion, attention to detail is what separates the good from the great‚Äîand if anyone understands the value of sweating the small stuff, it‚Äôs Jenni Lee. In March, the Brooklyn-based entrepreneur launched Comme Si, a line of Italian-made socks designed to feel as good as they look. ‚ÄúMy whole vision was that socks should be a functional luxury piece in your wardrobe. You should feel like you can wear them like an accessory,‚Äù she says. With semi-sheer crew-length pairs in ribbed silk and Egyptian cotton, her wares look equally at home peeking out from a sneaker as they do a leather loafer or even a pair of chunky slides. Lee is a longtime sock aficionado herself, accumulating high-quality pairs on summer trips to Korea because there was no reliable place at home to find more. ‚ÄúI had a few that were this beautiful pale pink, and super soft and super thin‚Ä¶ but I was like, ‚ÄòIf I lost these, theres no way I can find this exact shade of this exact material,‚Äù she says.   At the time, she was leading the marketing team at Harry‚Äôs, the direct-to-consumer shaving company, and watching the sock category become a hotspot for direct-to-consumer startups‚Äîmost of them geared toward male shoppers and athletic or novelty styles. She spotted a gap in the market for a more minimal, elevated line for women and set out to fill it.  ‚ÄúI had lots of conversations with the founders of Harry‚Äôs, who are my mentors, about my career goals and realized, ‚ÄòYou know what, my life dream is to be a CEO/founder. I want to launch and run my own business‚Äù she recalls. ‚ÄúThey were incredibly supportive about that decision.‚Äù The cultural moment also felt right to strike out on her own, with spaces like The Wing supporting female entrepreneurs and women like Emily Weiss of Glossier and Jen Rubio of Away (both of whom Lee had met through the startup world) achieving incredible success. ‚ÄúI thought, ‚ÄòYou know, maybe I could do this too.‚Äô‚Äù 
  Lee left Harry‚Äôs at the end of 2017 and took a few months to recalibrate‚Äîtime that, she says, gave her full appreciation for the creative process and for days when ‚Äúyou might not actually be producing something, but you‚Äôre definitely thinking and getting to that next stage.‚Äù First, she had to find manufacturing partners, so she tapped into her network to learn the ropes of supply-chain operations. She made a list of 127 potential factories (Lee is a big list person) and started cold-emailing and calling them one by one. Most she spoke with specifically produced athletic socks, and when she said she wanted semi-sheer, they directed her to hosiery factories. These didn‚Äôt fit the bill either, as they typically used nylon and polyurethane, synthetics she was hoping to avoid. By May, she was running out of options. She had a vacation to Italy planned with her husband, but none of the factories there had responded to her‚Äîwith the exception of one angry email saying her questions were too intrusive. ‚ÄúSo my husband says, ‚ÄòOK, well, why don‚Äôt we just go and basically knock down doors?‚Äô‚Äù   Game on: Lee and her husband mapped out factories across the northern region, which is known for textile manufacturing, and rented a car to drive to each of them. Finally, Lee‚Äôs luck kicked in. The first factory they stopped at was the perfect fit‚Äîan owner who cared about quality and, like her, wouldn‚Äôt compromise on ethics or materials. ‚ÄúWe had a conversation and I left thinking, ‚ÄòThis is our partner!‚Äô‚Äù With a manufacturer locked in, she was able to start building the rest of the brand. She made a list of potential brand names that met her specifications; she wanted a short phrase (‚ÄúI find phrases to just have more potential to be emotive‚Äù) that had not only some kind of meaning, but also an available URL and Instagram handle. Comme Si fit the bill, with its relation to the French phrase meaning ‚Äúas though,‚Äù  ‚Äúlike,‚Äù or ‚Äúas is.‚Äù ‚ÄúI liked this idea that it‚Äôs this filler phrase that kind of connects a sentence together but also is very casual,‚Äù she says, reasoning that with socks, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not the main focus in most people‚Äôs outfits, but they are something that makes a difference, and if you care about them, other people will notice.‚Äù Lee also sought out women and people of color for jobs like web design and engineering, because she wanted diversity to be part of the DNA of Comme Si from the beginning. And through a partnership with The Wing and Range Rover Evoque, Lee was linked up with Natalia Oberti Noguera, the founder and CEO of Pipeline Angels, ‚Äúa network of women and femme angel investors focused on funding women and femme entrepreneurs.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI founded this brand with very specific values in mind and that's something I intend to put first and foremost as I continue to grow my business.‚Äù  Oberti Noguera agreed that Lee‚Äôs focus on diversity was crucial to her brand. ‚ÄúIt was reassuring to leave the meetings with Natalia, confirming that, if there are values and certain things that are really important to me, I shouldn‚Äôt sacrifice them,‚Äù says Lee. ‚ÄúI founded this brand with very specific values in mind and that‚Äôs something I intend to put first and foremost as I continue to grow my business.‚Äù For her first collection, she drew upon the colors of her home state of Arizona for inspiration. ‚ÄúAs an adult, I‚Äôve had a newfound appreciation for growing up in the desert,‚Äù she says. When Lee was a kid, she saw the cacti in her front yard and longed for the Christmas trees of Home Alone. ‚ÄúNow, when I visit I‚Äôm like: ‚ÄòWow, this is so unique.‚Äô I don't know anywhere else in the world where you can actually see the land meet the sky for vast expanses, and the colors look like a watercolor painting.‚Äù She figured customers would probably gravitate toward the bold colors, like ‚Äúarancia,‚Äù a warm sunset-orange, and ‚Äúsaguaro,‚Äù an earthy cactus green. Instead, she‚Äôs found that there are two camps: those who love the attention-grabbing hues, and another that sticks to neutrals.   Mostly, she says, the Comme Si customer is ‚Äúa career-driven woman who‚Äôs really intentional about the brands that she buys. She‚Äôs probably graduated from buying fast-fashion and is buying a few investment pieces here and there.‚Äù She also likely invests in nice underwear and lingerie‚Äîitems that, like socks, are ‚Äúin the family of things that are really close to your body that you wear all day long, and that you should probably care about.‚Äù This fall will bring merino wool and 100% cashmere, the samples of which are so soft that she hasn‚Äôt wanted to take them off, even in 90-degree weather. She‚Äôs also planning to launch a line for men after fielding enough emails and DMs from guys wanting to know whether they can fit into the larger women‚Äôs size.  As for everything else, she‚Äôs taking it one (very well dressed) step at a time.

 The original "It" bag has a very glam past... This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. Fendi celebrated the relaunch of the Baguette with a party in a space dedicated to the It bag of the late '90s and early 2000s during New York Fashion Week. The Silvia Venturini Fendi-designed bag was first introduced in 1997 and became a fashion mainstay thanks in part to its special guest star status on Sex and the City.  Guests at NYFW party at the Madison Avenue flagship included Emma Roberts, Amanda Seyfried, Ebonee Davis, and Nina Agdal. Get the full history of this chic mini bag, which was designed with form rather than pure function in mind, and shop it below. 
 Maxine B√©dat of the New Standard Institute assesses the practices of 13 fashion brands that claim to be sustainable. What does it really mean for a fashion brand to be ‚Äúsustainable‚Äù? Some companies tout their use of recycled and reclaimed fibers, or their use of natural (non-petroleum based) raw materials, while others focus on timeless designs and artisanal labor, or their reduction of energy and water consumption. But these definitions lead down very different paths.  Recycled polyester (a.k.a. material made from recycled plastic), for example, has become synonymous with ‚Äúsustainability‚Äù despite available data suggesting that it may have a higher carbon footprint than natural fiber‚Äînot to mention the micro-plastic pollution it generates. Because there is no global fashion industry standard for sustainability, companies large and small continue to label their products ‚Äúsustainable,‚Äù when in fact, they still impact the environment on the following fronts: energy, water, chemical use, and impacts on forests and biodiversity. To steer the industry on a more sustainable course, New Standard Institute analyzed the brands best known for their low impact on the environment. How do they stack up? Use the key below to see how sustainable they really are: How they define sustainability: "We put sustainability at the center of everything we do. It is an evolving goal and definition, and we don‚Äôt have all the answers. But we want to focus on efforts that have the biggest impact. It influences four main areas: product, people, planet, progress." The brand has also been carbon-free since 2015 and offers a $100 credit to anyone who switches to wind energy.  How they define sustainability: ‚ÄúWe use responsibly sourced organic, recycled and regenerated materials whenever possible. We work to minimize the negative impacts associated with manufacturing and to ensure that all people involved are treated fairly and respectfully along the way.‚Äù How they define sustainability: ‚ÄúThere are 8 billion tons of plastic on the planet. And once it‚Äôs made‚Äîit never goes away. So, we‚Äôre making a commitment: No new plastic in our entire supply chain by 2021.‚Äù  How they define sustainability: "All Kowtow garments are certified by non-profit internationally recognized organizations. Independent audits and accreditation bodies ensure we remain true to our values. We support fair wages, no child labor, gender equality and grower community." How they define sustainability: "Leaving the world a better place than when we found it." How they define sustainability: Veja was founded as a social good company. They have direct relationships with the suppliers across their supply chain. How they define sustainability: ‚ÄúAll materials are sourced with an eye toward environmental good, whether organic and natural fabrics, reclaimed fibers that conserve material resources or trims made by artisan collectives in the developing world. While it‚Äôs an evolving process, one we‚Äôre continually striving to improve, each piece in the collection embodies a singular philosophy: that mindful living will always be in style.‚Äù How they define sustainability: "The collection is made from organic cotton and by using technologies such as Green Screen certified fabric softeners, ozone washes, laser finishing, e-flow washing, bio-based softeners and recipe combinations, we are able to reduce our water use by over 60 percent." How they define sustainability: The H&M Group releases a full, in-depth sustainability report each year. "Our sustainability vision is to use our size and scale for good, and with the help of technology and innovation, lead the change towards circular and renewable fashion while being a fair and equal company."  How they define sustainability: Leather used is animal byproduct; they have personal relationships with the farmers that supply their goods; they use vegetable dyes, recycled denim and used car tires; diversity in employees across globe; shoes are mostly made by hand as opposed to machine; efforts to reduce carbon footprint with shipping methods.  How they define their sustainability efforts: ‚ÄúFewer, better is the philosophy behind everything we do. We create timeless collections for the modern woman through carefully selected fabrics, precise silhouettes and attention to detail.‚Äù How they define sustainability: ‚ÄúWe are working towards a Global Environmental Policy to monitor, control and review environmental impacts and drive continuous improvements. We encourage our suppliers to be aware, concede to and implement their environmental responsibilities according to our Global Environmental Policy.‚Äù How they define sustainability: ‚ÄúHighest quality materials and ethically run factories.‚Äù
 üòçüòçüòç Cara Delevingne may be busy promoting her new book and starring in must-see movies, but the It Brit recently returned to her modeling roots for Jimmy Choo's latest campaign.  In a new editorial and short film, Delevingne sports what the brand touts as "unisex" flats and super-sparkly boots from its Cruise 2018 collection. The fur-lined, beaded and glitter-clad styles arrive just in time for the holidays. The flat, androgynous designs are from Jimmy Choo's "Borrowed from the Boys" collection, which offers a range of men's loafers in women's sizes. The iteration Delevingne wears in the new campaign is the Tedi, which is accented with rabbit fur. There's also the velvet-covered Marti and crystal-encrusted Marlo styles.  The model and actress, who has previously opened up about her fluid sexuality, elaborated on androgyny in fashion. "As I feel about life, being male or female is less 'opposite' now than it ever has been," she said in an interview for Jimmy Choo.  "I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessarily about picking something that a man would wear. I think it‚Äôs about feeling comfortable whether it is masculine or feminine."  That applies to more than just footwear. "If you decide to wear a suit I don‚Äôt think that necessarily has to be a masculine thing to wear," Delevingne added. "To master that look, it‚Äôs just about being comfortable with whatever you feel that day whether you decide to wear a ball gown or you decide to wear whatever you think a man would wear." The bulk of the new collection, however, focuses on glam, blinged-out heels, which Jimmy Choo is best known for.  Jimmy Choo Maine boots, $1,875, saksfifthavenue.com.

 In 6 months, SVNR hasn't even accumulated enough trash to fill a Ziploc bag. One of fashion‚Äôs most pressing topics of discussion in 2018 was how to cut back on the industry‚Äôs excessive waste while still creating new products. Everlane introduced a collection made entirely of recycled plastic bottles, brands like Burberry and H&M signed the New Plastics Economy Global Commitment to reduce plastic pollution, and now, an up-and-coming earring brand is looking to expand the eco-conscious mission to the jewelry industry.   Christina Tung didn't exactly mean to create her own sustainable jewelry brand. But while stuck inside on a rainy Memorial Day Weekend, the fashion publicist decided to play around and make a few pieces of jewelry for friends. After someone posted the earrings on Instagram, requests started flooding in from buyers and industry insiders and soon after, SVNR (pronounced souvenir) was born. Made entirely of repurposed beads, shells, and natural materials, the rising brand is bringing a new range of unique, handmade earrings to the jewelry scene‚Äîwithout placing a burden on the environment.  "I use exclusively natural materials and upcycled and repurposed beads, mostly from my mom, aunties, and friends who've been donating their collections of shells, beads, etc. If you know me, you know I hate waste, I think that everything can be re-purposed or re-used in some way.  Being zero waste right now is a very important part of my process," Tung told BAZAAR.com.  In fact, the designer's dedication to creatively up-cycle all of SVNR's earrings has generated virtually no pollution at all. "In the last 6 months, SVNR hasn't even accumulated enough trash to fill a Ziploc bag.   The world doesn't need more stuff, but we can make something cute from already existing stuff and hopefully ease the footprint on the environment," she revealed.   "The world doesn't need more stuff, but we can make something cute from already existing stuff and hopefully ease the footprint on the environment."   The earrings, which are sold individually or as pairs, range in price from $40 - $150. Along with the recycled component, SVNR's designs are also special in another way: they each pay nod to a mix of cultures across the globe. With styles named after destinations like Lagos, Nairobi, and Havana, each SVNR earring is inspired by a city around the world‚Äîfrom the designer's own personal travels to her bucket list getaways.  "I hope to really evoke a color palette, textures, and somehow capture the light because it  feels different in every city at a specific time of year.  I take a lot of photos when I travel, so I'll look at them and think about the colors and relationship to the textures and opacity to balance out the feeling of the photo and how I remember it," Tung explained. With its specially hand-made designs, the brand's range of pieces make for the perfect way to break anyone out of their earring comfort zone‚Äîwithout increasing your carbon footprint. 
 Nathan Jenden takes on the role, following Jonathan Saunder's resignation last month. Update, 1/4/18: Diane von Furstenberg has named Nathan Jenden its new chief design officer and VP, the company announced today. Jenden previously served as DVF‚Äôs creative director from 2001 to 2010, Business of Fashion reports. His return to the role comes about a month after Jonathan Saunders stepped down from the position in December 2017. ‚ÄúNathan is an extremely talented and technically skilful designer who also has a great gift at surrounding himself with young, emerging talent,‚Äù founder Diane von Furstenberg said in a statement. ‚ÄúIt is with joy and pride that I look forward to welcoming Nathan back at DVF.‚Äù ‚ÄúI want to make great clothes that resonate with women,‚Äù added Jenden. ‚ÄúI see DVF as being more relevant today than it ever was in its message of self-empowerment while being dynamic and modern. I want to give the DVF girl what she wants, when she wants it, and with the joie de vivre and sense of purpose that epitomizes Diane, DVF the brand and the spirit of women today.‚Äù Jenden‚Äôs first collection with DVF will be the Fall 2018 range, debuting in February. Original story, 12/15/17: Jonathan Saunders is stepping down from his role as chief creative officer at Diane von Furstenberg, effective immediately, according to Business of Fashion. The Scottish designer has served as the brand's chief creative officer for just 18 months.  "I am grateful for Diane's support and for the opportunity of guiding this iconic brand. I am so proud of everything we have accomplished in the past 18 months. I thank the incredible team for their dedication and support, and will continue to be a friend and admirer of the brand," Saunders said in a statement.  After putting his own namesake label on hold, Saunders joined the fashion house in May 2016 and has since made a series of changes throughout the brand. Along with revamping the DVF logo, the chief creative officer also moved from traditional runway shows to more low-key presentations during New York Fashion Week.  As for his designs, Saunders's collections for the brand were received well by critics‚Äîushering in a new era of DVF filled with whimsical prints, bold colors, and fresh updates on some of the designer's signature pieces.

He will leave an important and lasting heritage to the brand,‚Äù Diane von Furstenberg said in a statement.  As BoF reports, there was allegedly "some degree of friction" between Saunders and von Furstenberg, due to the fact that the founder remained so involved and close to the brand following his appointment as chief creative officer.  The only question now is: who will take the reigns at DVF? Let the never-ending game of designer musical chairs continue...
 The model shows off her boxing skills.  Ringing in Day 4 of Love Magazine's 2017 advent calendar series is Kendall Jenner, who shows off her boxing skills in a Rocky-inspired video.  Following Ashley Graham's powerful running Day 2 video and Emily Ratajkowski rolling around in spaghetti for Day 3, Kendall steps into the boxing ring for the latest installment of the video series. After chugging a glass of raw eggs, the model breaks a sweat in a gray adidas outfit and sweatband while throwing punches, attempting one-armed push-ups, and jumping rope.  Taking "get you a girl who can do both," to the next level, the model stars as both Rocky Balboa and his girlfriend Adrian in the video. Cheering herself on from the sidelines, Jenner wears a chic black suit, white ruffled blouse and black beret.    The video follows the "Stay Strong" theme of Love's 2017 calendar, which celebrates strong and powerful women. The Philip Poynter-directed series will be spotlighting models showing off their strength all month long in a variety of mini workout videos‚Äîtaking a departure from the ultra-sexy, lingerie clad videos of the past.  According to the description of Jenner's video, she boxes with her personal trainer Rob Piela (who owns New York's Gotham Gym). Oh, and yes, apparently she did really drink that glass of raw eggs. Impressive. 
 See if Italians really do it better... Milan is known for powerhouses like Gucci and Prada, mixed with some chic up-and-comers like Attico. See where the Italians land for Spring 2019, with only the best from each collection. In theme with their more recent catwalks, Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana tapped a legion of top models and famous faces to walk their Spring 2019 show for a collection that was inspired by DNA. While the designers projected their fingerprints on screens behind the runway, the collection seemed to call more to the brand's DNA than the diversity of their customer base. Bold prints abounded per usual, and last Spring's pea pods and cabbages were replaced with bouquets of blooms, hearts, and even chickens and roosters on full-skirted gowns. The brand's embroidered suiting took center stage this season, and seems a fitting replacement for their stunning gowns. Top Italian talent like Monica Bellucci and Isabella Rossellini joined Carla Bruni, Eva Herzigova, Helena Christensen and Lady Kitty Spencer on the runway, each donning a look that felt unique to what makes their style worthy of a cameo at Milan Fashion Week. ‚Äì Carrie Goldberg Emporio Armani's sporty sister label felt familiar‚Äìbut in all the right ways. Fresh, modern takes on brand staples felt inspired by marine life. An opalescent rainbow fish came to mind as models wafted down the runway in scale-like embroidery shimmering on almost-liquid silks. The head-to-toe palette, which mixed ocean grays and blues with bold fuchsia and pearlescent hues, included some killer shoes. A standout was a glittering pointed-toe sheer bootie that made for a fluid pairing with like-textured palazzo pants and midi skirts. PVC accessories and fishnet-esque handbags capped off the aquatic feel, and made us want to head to the beach.  ‚Äì Carrie Goldberg This is a show that always seems dedicated, first and foremost, to brand loyalists‚Äìwomen that live for a voluminous, asymmetrically-draped blouse or a balloon pant in a bold, statement print. These styling gurus rule the streets of Milan, Florence, Tokyo and downtown NYC, and they'll find tons to lust over in Marni's Spring 2019 offering from newly appointed creative director Francesco Risso. With that in mind, those who aren't accustomed to filling their wardrobes with all things Marni shouldn't shy away from the season's chic, draped dresses, bold and bright statement coats, sleek leather goods, and the brand's signature attention-grabbing jewelry. This is the kind of brand were treasures lurk around every corner‚Äìdon't be afraid to splurge. ‚Äì Carrie Goldberg The 65th anniversary of the Missoni brand was high time to showcase what this label does best‚Äìknitwear. This season, the brand's fine loom-work was displayed in a palette that was entirely ethereal‚Äìfrom shades of gray and beige to soft whites, jade, and soft indigo, with elements of shimmering sparkle scattered in between. The collection also featured warm weather cloaks, floor-dusters we didn't know we wanted until they were paired with everything from gowns to separates and showcased with and without sleeves, and with shawls for added texture. We'll take one of each, please. ‚Äì Carrie Goldberg Stella Tennant opened the Ferragamo show in a leather apron hem skirt worn with a simple khaki tee and show-stopping boots. It's hardly Milanese-lady, but doubtlessly made with grown women in mind. There are anoraks and leather shirt dresses, a killer leather jumpsuit. It's all belted and luxe, but sporty and slightly militaristic‚Äîwomen the world over may be in battle mode, and now they have the chic uniform to match. -Kerry Pieri Nearly 4 years into his tenure, Lorenzo Serafini is putting out looks that are nothing short of exactly what all the cool young chicks want to be wearing. All the mainstays are just a little extra special‚ÄîBella's black romper plays with volume in all of the right ways, that white lace dress has slits up to there while still maintaining wearability, short shorts get the boheme treatment and that swimsuit meets track jacket is sexy-sporty executed perfectly. Consider it your summer wardrobe, sorted. -Kerry Pieri
 And it's just as empowering as you'd expect.   Serving as stylist and wardrobe advisor to Michelle Obama, it was Meredith Koop who helped define the First Lady‚Äôs modern, inclusive, and often groundbreaking style during her time in the White House. Now, Koop is bringing her talents to a project tailor-made for all working women.  For her first-ever partnership with a fashion brand, Koop collaborated with Cuyana on its New Office Collection, a range of pieces that merge the contemporary woman's working wardrobe with her everyday pieces. The brand, known for its "fewer, better things" tagline, wanted to create a streamlined range of essentials that women could wear no matter where they work‚Äîfrom the corporate office to a shared workspace or home office‚Äîand transition into their downtime. When it came to conceptualizing and styling the collection, Koop was the perfect choice. "We absolutely admired the way she worked with First Lady Michelle Obama‚Äîit was a completely modern approach that married style with substance, which really resonated with us‚Äîbut Meredith is an expert at styling all kinds of women," Shilpa Shah, co-founder of Cuyana, told BAZAAR.com. "She has a very innate understanding of the modern woman and her need for a versatile wardrobe that can adapt to any situation while helping her remain stylish and most importantly, give her the confidence she needs to succeed." For Koop, the partnership made just as much sense. "I want to work with companies that are like-minded in their view towards not only the environment, but how clothes are made‚Äîparticularly because so many clothes and accessories are made by women," she told BAZAAR.com. "I think the duality in respecting women is not only in the women that you're selling to or how you represent women in your campaigns, but also how you consider the workforce of women behind the clothing industry." Koop called on four friends who work at The Wing D.C. to star in the Cuyana campaign. "It's cool that we partnered with The Wing because [it's] unique in its intention to bring women together in a professional and personal sense. Really that was chosen as a reflection...people go there and work, they socialize, they have meetings there, they hang out there all day, and take phone calls." Yene Damtew (a personal hairstylist and salon owner), Soumeya Benghanem (chief product officer and founder of Strategy & Action), Sarween Salih (owner of S3 Active), and Kristin Jones (co-founder and partner at Inside Projects) all model the New Office collection for the campaign. The looks include easy-to-wear knits, corporate-appropriate blouses, and a range of leather bags ideal for every woman's wardrobe. ‚ÄúThese are women that I know. I chose them because of what they do more than how they look, even though I think they are all very beautiful," Koop explained. "But I think what they do and the way that they are in the world is really the cake and then the way that they look and what they're wearing is the icing on the cake." So, did working with Michelle Obama change Koop's perception of fashion and how she styles women? "Yes, for sure," Koop said, taking a moment to pause before continuing, "My perception of fashion and styling is changing every day. I think that should be true for everyone, because our culture is changing every day. Fashion should reflect that. It shouldn't be a stagnant proposition." 

 She stunned in all white at the designer's first menswear show in Paris.  For his first show as the artistic director of Louis Vuitton Menswear, Virgil Abloh churned out a star-studded front row today in Paris. Amongst the A-listers in attendance (from Kanye West and Kim Kardashian to Bella Hadid and A$AP Rocky), was none other than Rihanna, who was the first to step out in the designer's new pieces for the fashion house.  Arriving at the Grand Palais, Bad Gal Riri stunned in an Abloh-designed white monochromatic look featuring a utility-inspired wide-leg jumpsuit, pointy toe pumps, and angular sunglasses. Accessory-wise, Riri carried Vuitton's newly-launched see-through Keepall duffle bag along with white monogrammed Vuitton bags including the Danube worn as a belt bag and the Petite Boite Chapeau.    On Instagram, she shared a closer look at her all-white ensemble and new LV bags. In her transparent Vuitton duffel bag was an invitation to the Men's Spring 2019 show along with a neon graphic t-shirt that was handed out to guests as the show.   Gusband & wife at the @louisvuitton cookout ‚úäüèø A post shared by  badgalriri (@badgalriri) on Jun 21, 2018 at 7:47am PDT Abloh shared a photo of the Vuitton merch being given out at the show on Instagram, along with the sweet backstory behind it. "Like some kids today i started the surreal mission without ‚Äúfashion school‚Äù but a blank t-shirt, a screen printed idea for it and a dream. as a nod to that on every seat is a graphic t-shirt I made the early days @louisvuitton once i learned how to use the photocopier in the office," he wrote.   like some kids today i started the surreal mission without ‚Äúfashion school‚Äù but a blank t-shirt, a screen printed idea for it and a dream. as a nod to that on every seat is a graphic t-shirt I made the early days @louisvuitton once i learned how to use the photocopier in the office. A post shared by @ virgilabloh on Jun 21, 2018 at 2:24am PDT Abloh's debut collection for Louis Vuitton Men's is a significant one as it marks the first time an African-American designer has taken the reins at the French fashion house. To celebrate that moment, Kanye West was also in attendance at the show‚Äîwhich resulted in another powerful and emotional moment: From Rihanna to Kanye and Bella, Virgil already unsurprisingly seems to have an A-list support system in his new role at Louis Vuitton. 
 Because "circus chic" is now a thing.  If 2019 is the year that you're planning your wedding, but you still haven't discovered your perfect wedding gown just yet, then look no further. Thanks to some major inspiration from Celia Kritharioti's Spring Summer 2019 show at Paris Fashion Week, we now know that it's possible to rock helium balloons on your wedding day. Taking to the runway in a sumptuous and strapless pink and white gown, the model's sparkly veil was elevated in the air thanks to a plethora of transparent balloons filled with what looked like pink polka dot confetti. The iconic moment that was everyone's new favorite wedding look took the runway and was shared on Twitter by Ms. Laurent. And, for added effect, the model's walk was accompanied by circus music, because if you can't be a little extra on your wedding day, when can you be? 
  The show-stopping look saw the stunning veil lifted, via helium, into the air, smoothly moving as the model walked her dramatic, candy-colored dress down the runway:   Basically, if you were all out of ideas for making an unexpectedly dramatic entrance at your nuptials, then this is definitely an option. Plus if "circus chic" is one of your passions, then this Haute Couture moment makes a serious case for walking down the aisle to an unforgettable and surprising piece of music: This isn't the first Haute Couture bridal look to grace Paris Fashion Week. Chanel's take on the beach wedding included an intricately bejeweled one-piece swimsuit, with a matching swimcap, which closed out their Paris show this week: SUBSCRIBE
 The teenager talks about the importance of normalizing Photoshop-free bodies and more. Earlier this year, Aerie expanded its #AerieReal Role Model program with an empowering campaign starring Yara Shahidi, Aly Raisman and Iskra Lawrence. Now, the brand ambassadors are back with another set of inspiring ads‚Äîthis time starring alongside their own role models: their mothers. The timely pre-Mother's Day campaign was particularly special to Yara Shahidi, who starred alongside her mom Keri. Despite being just 18 years old, the actress has already built her career on inspiring and empowering young women‚Äîwhich fits perfectly into both elements of this project: Aerie's brand ethos and working with her mother.  "Shooting the campaign with my mom was so much fun," Shahidi told BAZAAR.com, "I mean, we started in this life together so I feel like it‚Äôs just second nature [to work with her]. I think it‚Äôs really powerful that Aerie is celebrating our bodies as they are. To be in anything with my mama is a great opportunity."  Keri wears Aerie distressed sweater; Yara wears an Aerie one-piece swimsuit and denim shorts. "My mother was my role model of success and helped me believe that all of my dreams are possible," the teenager said. When asked what the most important thing her mom taught her, Shahidi didn't even have to think twice before answering, "how to maneuver in spaces and realizing that I‚Äôm worthy of being in the space that I‚Äôm in."  Not only was starring in Aerie's Role Model campaign alongside her mom important, but being part of the brand's ongoing mission to celebrate all bodies is also key to the Grown-ish star. Aerie famously went Photoshop-free in all its campaigns, ads and images back in 2014‚Äîa pledge it has stuck to and embraced ever since.  When asked her thoughts on the growing number of women (celebrities included) who feel the need to Photoshop or Facetune their own photos on social media, Yara reminded us all why campaigns like this are so crucial:  "Without criticizing anything that anyone else is doing, I have to say speaking from the positive, it‚Äôs important that we have platforms which are saying more than 'your own body is okay' and don‚Äôt Photoshop it, but that your own body is absolute perfection just as it is. Because the need to tweak photos doesn‚Äôt just stem from one day waking up with that whimsical idea, but the fact that we‚Äôre overly critical of ourselves and other people are overly critical of each other so there is that impending pressure [to Photoshop]. So to have a major brand say that we‚Äôre going to normalize our bodies is important.‚Äù Aerie jumpsuit, $37, SHOP For the 18-year-old, her ongoing work as an Aerie Role Model means more than just another campaign, "I know the feeling I had when I saw my friend Salem [Mitchell], who was in one of Aerie's campaigns, on a large billboard‚Äîjust that feeling of joy.  I hope that Aerie, as it grows as a brand with this campaign and with being more cognizant of the importance of inclusion in all areas, will have an impact on people like myself who are seeing these billboards and ads and seeing that our bodies are being normalized." She continued, "To be able to be in collaboration with brands that I truly stand behind is important because I feel like it speaks to the idea that fashion is inherently political and so is beauty. So to be able to do the best work that I possibly can in these areas to be a benefit to the world at large, in terms of expanding certain narratives, is important."

 The 16-year-old hit her first catwalk on Day 1 of New York Fashion Week. Just days after turning 16, Kaia Gerber officially made her big runway debut tonight during New York Fashion Week. For her first show, the teenage daughter of Cindy Crawford walked Calvin Klein Spring 2018.  In her first runway appearance, Kaia wore a black and white silk blouse and bright yellow pants.

 "Got my wings!"  Ashley Graham has already proved herself worthy of any lingerie show after hitting the catwalk in Addition Elle underwear for New York Fashion Week in September. And now the 30-year-old model - who is an advocate for healthy body acceptance - appeared to be taking aim at luxury lingerie label Victoria's Secret, who has yet to introduce plus-size models in their annual fashion show.  So Graham turned herself into an honorary Angel by photoshopping a pair of extravagant white wings to an image of herself modelling underwear on the runway during NYFW.  Along with the picture, the curvaceous star added the caption: "Got my wings! my #AdditionElle wings!#thickthighssavelives" The catwalk queen has collaborated with Addition Elle on their underwear line since 2012, with the brand championing "fashion democracy" with their range of clothes and lingerie from size 12-26. Meanwhile, Graham has previously said she would love to take part in the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show - which takes place today in Shanghai - if the label were to feature size 12 and above models in their shows. "Oh yeah. I mean when Victoria's Secret calls me and asks me to be on their runway I am going to say yes," she told TMZ.  The models who are featuring in the show include Bella Hadid, Martha Hunt, Adriana Lima, Stella Maxwell, Elsa Hosk, Alessandra Ambrosio, Lily Aldridge, Lais Ribeiro, Sara Sampaio, Josephine Skriver, Romee Strijd, Candice Swanepoel, Jasmine Tookes, and Karlie Kloss.  There will be performances from Harry Styles, Miguel, Leslie Odom Jr. and Chinese pop sensation Jane Zhang.  Meanwhile, Chrissy Teigen was angling for an invite to star in the show, and recruited fans on social media to make it happen.  Here's to Chrissy and Ashley getting their well-deserved invite next year.

Can't stop won't stop get guapChillin' with Bazaar and you know we tip topSaks Fifth Avenue, shopping 'til I dropAll these shoes hella fly, girl, you know I'm 'bout to cop Hanging out with Bazaar Senior Fashion Editor Chrissy Rutherford, Saweetie is on the hunt for the perfect pair of fly, bougie, classy shoes to rock at an upcoming event in celebration of High Maintenance. Making their way around Saks Fifth Avenue's decked-out designer shoe showroom, the infamous ICY GRL admits that she's fairly new to the high-fashion shoe game, recalling that her first pair of high heels were "probably just some cheap bulky platform shoes." Despite her new-girl status, Saweetie proves 100 percent in her element surrounded by all things fancy. The artist even eyes an especially extra pair of $990 Miu Miu cheetah fur-lined slides adorned with white pearls, which she admiringly dubs "fly bear mama" kicks‚Äîobviously, ICY GRL-approved. To narrow down her contenders, Saweetie sits down to try on some fresh designer kicks, looking for the pair that'll be the perfect match with her bossy silver-studded black Moschino suit.

At the end of the heel hunt, it's a hot pair of bright pink crystalized Balenciaga stilettos that fit the bill for the songstress, looking extra fly in her full event ensemble.

 The actress follows in Gigi Hadid's footsteps at the brand.  Nearly one year after his design partnership with Gigi Hadid ended, Tommy Hilfiger has tapped Zendaya as his new women's ambassador and co-designer.  Along with starring in the brand's Spring 2019 global campaign, Zendaya is also slated to design a collaborative collection with Hilfiger. The capsule collection, dubbed Tommy x Zendaya, will be released for the Spring 2019 season.   ‚ÄúI love to collaborate with people who are passionate about making their dreams a reality and who inspire the next generation to do the same," Tommy Hilfiger said in a statement from the brand. ‚ÄúZendaya has become a global icon, using fashion to make bold statements while always staying true to herself. Our capsule collection will fuse her eclectic style with the Americana spirit of our brand.‚Äù Previously, Tommy Hilfiger collaborated with Gigi Hadid on a two-year design partnership that debuted over a series of extravagant runway events in New York, Los Angeles, London, and Milan. Most recently, the brand tapped Lewis Hamilton as it's men's ambassador and executed a similar runway event in Shanghai for Fall 2018.  It's unclear whether the Tommy x Zendaya collaboration will include a runway show and if so, whether Zendaya herself would make her catwalk debut.  "Fashion is more than just wearing cool clothes. It‚Äôs a way to celebrate self-expression and individuality, which is extremely empowering. This is why I am proud to partner with Tommy Hilfiger," Zendaya said in a statement from the brand.  Given her risk-taking sense of style, we're already exicted to see what the Zendaya x Tommy collection has in store. 
 Loewe sent a new sneaker down its Spring 2018 runways... As Loewe's Spring 2018 collection hit the runway during Paris Fashion Week today, there was one standout accessory that was impossible to overlook: ultra pointy-toe sneakers.Taking the luxury sneaker to new heights (literally), the curved upward shoes posed sneakerheads' favorite question, "what are THOSE?"  Inspired by the traveling woman, the Jonathan Anderson-designed footwear seemingly reference Mexican pointy boots, which are extremely curved upwards boots worn by men in North-Central Mexico. Loewe's rendition of the pointed shoes included luxe reptile-embossed sneakers, suede, and several bold colorways.  Of course, people on Twitter couldn't help but notice the references to both elves and Aladdin...   While fashion's sneaker obsession likely isn't going anywhere anytime soon, will these pointy renditions become the next street style must-haves?
 Gowns, pasties, and oversized sombreros. From Lady Gaga to Miley Cyrus, these celebrities have made some questionable choices when it comes to airport dressing. Click through to see some of the wildest travel looks over the years.  Brigitte Bardot, 1965: Arriving at Paris' Orly airport after a trip to Mexico, Bardot's all smiles. But something tells us her seat mates were less than thrilled about her choice of hat? Lady Gaga, 2015: Didn't even make it to curbside check in before tripping in these shoes.  Phyllis Diller, 1968: When this photo was taken, American comedian Phyllis Diller had just arrived at London's Heathrow airport with THIRTY-FIVE suitcases. Which is perhaps why she's wearing an absurd amount of fabric around her neck...so she doesn't have to check a 36th bag?  Lady Gaga, 2011: At Tokyo's Narita airport in a monochrome look with maniacally high stilettos. Lady Gaga, 2012: At Tokyo's Narita airport  in 2012. Never not wearing ridiculous airport shoes.  Lady Gaga 2014: Two years later and again at Tokyo's Narita airport, still wearing ankle-breaking airport shoes.  Lady Gaga, 2014: At South Korea's Gimpo Airport, this time, wearing cheeks appliques that makes her look like a Pok√©mon character.  Bella Thorne, 2018: At Los Angeles International Airport. Is this the biggest hood on a jacket....ever? Ariana Grande, 2015: She's also wearing The Practical-Until-You-Have-to-Pee Jumpsuit, but it's her footwear that kills us.  Bai Ling, 2016: I don't want even to see the person in the seat next to me wearing open-toed shoes or too sheer leggings, but underboob?! That's a whole other level. Miley Cyrus,  2015: Sunflower-shaped pasties. Do we even need to say more.  Lady Gaga, 2014: Butt. Kim Kardashian, 2012: Having to carry your skirt as you walk is glamorous when you're strolling a red carpet. When you're hustling through the airport, it's just dumb. Ashley Greene, 2012: Dragging hems are not your friend when you're going somewhere with people movers, escalators, and a generally gross floors everywhere. Nicole Scherzinger, 2012: How on earth is she not paranoid that she's stepping on the back of her dress the entire time? Candice Swanepoel, 2013: Candice appears to be stepping on the hem of her maxi skirt, but that doesn't stop her from powering through her airport walk like the supermodel that she is. Kesha, 2015: Honestly worried about her getting caught on that escalator. Turn around and look where you're going, Kesha!  Paris Hilton, 2016: Needs to take her sunglasses off and watch where she's stepping in this gown and heels situation. Paris Hilton, 2016: This time, Paris chose a maxi dress with a slit in the front to give her legs some additional walking room. Kesha, 2016: Though Kesha loves her airport maxi dresses, she tightly clutches on to this one just in case she takes a tumble. Lady Gaga, 2011:  She really is a master at somehow overcomplicating the airport outfit, even when she's wearing something "normal" for her.  Lady Gaga, 2014: Arriving in Istanbul in...this...in 2014. She's in a league all her own.  Taylor Swift, 2014: On the flip side of the Too-Long Hem, you also don't want to wear teeny tiny shorts, because A) You've got SO MUCH of your bare skin exposed to the gross airplane seat and B) HOW are you not cold?  Kate Hudson, 2015: Like,  that scarf isn't going to keep you warm on the over air conditioned plane when you're wearing hot pants. Candice Swanepoel, 2012: Shearling and short shorts. If she's trying to confuse us about where she's heading, it's working.  Miley Cyrus, 2010: Long sweater, teeeeeeny shorts. Jessica Simpson, 2014: Also, absurd shoes. Halsey, 2018: Teeny shorts and an even teenier crop top to go with it. Paris Hilton, 2015: Really? Lady Gaga, 2015: Impractical train + crotch-baring slit. Double whammy.

 Leg slits and latex ruled. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. After stepping out in an affordable pistachio green dress in Florence, Irina Shayk did what she does best‚Äîshe hit the runway. As part of this year's Pitti Immagine Uomo, at which Clare Waight Keller's standalone Givenchy men's show debuted, Shayk took part in the CR Runway x LUISAVIAROMA 90th Anniversary Show, alongside a slew of supermodels including Bella Hadid and Joan Smalls. In fact, the trio made quite an impact when they took to the runway in unison, wearing some seriously revealing, all-black looks. While Shayk and Smalls wore matching Mugler looks consisting of stockings and skirts with leg slits, Hadid also rocked a look from the brand, including a pair of super tight latex boots.  Basically, the epic trio totally slayed, which is to be expected: Shayk's second look was even better than the first, as the model donned a strapless leather dress with matching gloves: Gigi Hadid also walked the runway, wearing a black bondage dress by Versace with an extremely high leg slit and a revealing torso panel that's available to shop now. She hit the runway alongside fellow models Vittoria Ceretti and Anok Yai:
 "It's a way of showing the power of a woman." Last month during London Fashion Week, model Valeria Garcia turned heads when she walked down the runway with a wearable breast pump under her outfit. She stepped onto the runway at Marta Jakubowksi‚Äôs Spring 2019 show in what looked like a regular suit, but when she returned to the catwalk for the finale, she opened her jacket to reveal a bra and two pumps underneath.  Garcia recalls show-goers standing and applauding in their seats, but the reactions spread far beyond London. As the latest celebration of motherhood on the runway this year‚Äîfollowing two pregnant models at Rihanna‚Äôs Fenty x Savage show and a breastfeeding mom at the Sports Illustrated swimsuit show‚ÄîGarcia‚Äôs walk made headlines across the pond. ‚ÄúI felt confident and happy to do it. I was happy to see it was everywhere,‚Äù Garcia tells BAZAAR.com. ‚ÄúIt was kind of funny at the same time because I saw some reviews say like, ‚ÄòThe first woman to walk with a breast pump in history!‚Äô I didn't have that thought during the show, but it helps for us to be more confident and happy. I think breastfeeding is amazing. It's something great for all women to do.‚Äù The reaction from fellow mothers was swift. ‚ÄúAfter the show, I saw a lot of people contact me through Instagram, and they were saying, 'Oh, I'm so happy. It's great what you did, showing that it's something really natural,'" says the Argentinean-born, London-based model. Garcia, 35, is the mother of two boys‚ÄîSalvador, 5, and Ant√≥n, 1‚Äîwho were both present at the show and witnessed her viral walk in person. The Harper‚Äôs BAZAAR Argentina cover model has also modeled for magazines like Marie Claire Mexico, and brands from L‚ÄôOr√©al to Armani, but this marked her first time on a runway in nearly six years. She stopped walking in shows before having her first child.  As fashion week castings go, Garcia was asked last-minute to appear in Jakubowski‚Äôs lineup. Her agency told her the designer was looking for a real-life mom to model a practical, wearable breast pump that women's tech brand Elvie wanted to launch at the show. Garcia, who breastfed and pumped for both of her children, happily obliged. It was the only show she walked this fashion month. ‚ÄúI'm really pro-breastfeeding. I fed both of my boys. I never did formula or anything,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI was really amazed when I saw the product because it's really quiet and you can really do whatever you want to do while you're using it. I thought, ‚ÄòPeople will get the message. You can even do runway with the pump on.‚Äô‚Äù  The Elvie pump, which took three years to develop, was designed to be silent and non-constricting so that women could wear it under a nursing bra while doing everyday activities (including working and traveling‚Äîtwo historically difficult areas for women to find a place to pump).  Elvie pump, $249 single, $479 double, available January 19, elvie.com. Join Waitlist ‚ÄúOur products are all about how can women be the women they want to be and the mother they want to be,‚Äù Elvie CEO, Tania Boler, says. The brand often puts women's health issues through a lifestyle lens, adds Boler, who has a Ph.D in women's health. Debuting the pump at London Fashion Week aligned with that plan. The Elvie team and Marta Jakubowksi had wanted to work together on a statement about women's issues, "and then we met Valeria and the magic happened at that point, really," says Boler. Garcia wasn‚Äôt nervous to pull off the stunt. ‚ÄúI never thought of what would people think about it,‚Äù she recalls. ‚ÄúI thought, ‚ÄòOkay. It's very natural.'" In fact, Boler thought Garcia was a perfect model for Elvie's pump lunch. "She lived through these issues," the CEO says, citing the pressure on models to return to work quickly and get in shape after giving birth. "She's got a tiny little baby and is already back at work. She knows how difficult it can be and how pumping should be something that is empowering for women, and that gives women choice.‚Äù Valeria used a breast pump with both of her boys. When she returned to work after giving birth to her first child, her husband would sometimes bring their son to her to breastfeed during breaks, but on busier days, the pump came in handy. She used it less with her second child because she waited longer to return to work.  Nowadays, Garcia is a ‚Äúfull-time mom,‚Äù she says, which includes taking her son to school, playing with the kids, and cooking‚Äîbut she still models sometimes "if something comes up."  Garcia‚Äôs breast pump walk was timely, as it arrives during an ongoing conversation about women's right to breastfeed in public. On top of that, working mothers who pump in the office often face challenges, like lack of proper lactation facilities, insufficient break time, and humiliation in male-dominated environments. ‚ÄúWhen the baby's hungry and they're crying, what are you supposed to do? Go by yourself and cover completely in a cape or something?‚Äù Garcia quips. ‚ÄúIt's something natural and it's beautiful. For me, with both of [my sons], wherever I was, if I'm in the bus and he's hungry, I just [feed] him.‚Äù  Almost here! 2 Months Countdown!‚ù§ Thanks to my amazing husband and little boy for this beautiful photos! LoveU A post shared by  Valeria Garcia (@valeriagarciaofficial) on Apr 4, 2017 at 7:23am PDT Garcia, who‚Äôs been modeling for 15 years, says representation of motherhood was especially progressive this season. Slick Woods was one of two pregnant women to walk in Rihanna‚Äôs Fenty x Savage lingerie show. She even went into labor after exiting the runway. Earlier this summer, Mara Martin breastfed her five-month-old daughter while modeling a swimsuit on the catwalk. ‚ÄúI think this year, it's been more 'Mom,'‚Äù Garcia says. She's also noticed more body diversity, whether it's through models posing pregnant or new moms flaunting their real, imperfect bellies. "For me, it's the same with both of [my kids], my belly's not perfect and it's just the way it is, and I'm happy," adds Garcia. "It's something that I'm proud of, to be the mom. Of course your body's going to change." Garcia's walk also takes place as the runways continue to improve inclusivity in size, race, age, and sexuality. NYFW, for example, had its most diverse season yet. ‚ÄúI think it's great to show you don't need to be this way or that way. You can be whoever you are and be proud of what you are,‚Äù the model says. "I think it's a way of showing the power of a woman."
 The brand teams up with Exactitudes for a photo series. Celebrating its fashion legacy, Helmut Lang teamed up with Exactitudes for a photo project highlighting the brand's biggest collectors over the years.  The series of photos, shot by Exactitude founders Ari Versus and Ellie Uyttenbroek, stars 12 Helmut Lang fans, most notably including Kanye West and Solange Knowles. The multi-generational lineup of collectors wears their own personal archival pieces from the brand along with pieces from Helmut Lang Re-Edition, a newly-launched capsule collection featuring curated pieces from the brand archives.   The full lineup, from the top left row, includes Jimmy Grillo, Alison Marie Isbell, Yohana Lebasi, Grace Lee Gee, Kanye West, Dominik Halas, Solange Knowles, Eric Lawrence, Rhamier Auguste, Johnny Petrozzino, David Gagliardi, and Anna Santangelo.  Fans of Helmut Lang (Kanye and Solange included) are known to avidly collect timeless pieces from the brand's collections‚Äîmaking the photo project for a cool way to celebrate that unique component of the brand. West, for example, wears his own Helmut Lang archive jeans along with a new hooded parka and sweater from the Re-Edition Volume 1 collection.   Kanye West is a HELMUT LANG FAN seen by EXACTITUDES¬Æ Artist Kanye wears the Hooded Parka and Slashed Elbow sweater from Re-Edition Volume 1 and jeans from his own Helmut Lang archive.

 Jones will replace Kris Van Assche.  After 11 years at Dior Homme, Kris Van Assche is exiting his role as artistic director and will be succeeded by Kim Jones, effective immediately.  "I am leaving this beautiful house to pursue new challenges," Van Assche said in a statement from the brand. "I wish to thank Bernard Arnault for the trust he placed in me, Sidney Toledano and Serge Brunschwig for their warm welcome at Dior and their continuous support during all those years." Jones, who departed his role as artistic director of Louis Vuitton menswear two months ago, will present his first collection for Dior Homme in June at Paris Men's Fashion Week. "I am deeply honored to join the house of Dior, a symbol of the ultimate elegance. I would like to warmly thank Bernard Arnault and Pietro Beccari for their trust in giving me this incredible opportunity. I am committed to create a modern and innovative male silhouette built upon the unique legacy of the house," Jones said in a statement from the brand.  Though it has yet to be revealed what's next for Kris Van Assche, Jones's addition at Dior Homme will certainly be a shakeup for the French menswear brand. Known for his streetwear-inspired collections (which includes Louis Vuitton's recent collaboration with Supreme), Jones will likely usher in a new chapter of Dior Homme.   @iamnaomicampbell @katemossagency  last one I promise but I love you for this ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è A post shared by  mrkimjones (@mrkimjones) on Jan 18, 2018 at 11:35am PST Kim Jones takes his final bow at Louis Vuitton Men's alongside Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell. 
 And it's still available to shop in four different prints.  Every summer has its crop of It pieces that get chosen as the lucky ones by the fashion set. Last year, it was that Realisation Par silk leopard skirt and just about anything with a puff sleeve. This season, Reformation's 'Lacey' dress is proving to be a contender for the ultimate must-have of Summer 2019.  The versatile midi dress, which comes in four different prints, has already been spotted on Kaia Gerber, Busy Philipps, Lili Reinhart, Zoey Dutch and a long list of influencers on the 'gram. Featuring a sweetheart neckline, subtle puff sleeves, and a high slit, the $248 dress checks all the boxes of our favorite summer trends.   FYC. A post shared by  Busy Philipps (@busyphilipps) on Jun 11, 2019 at 8:23pm PDT It also makes for a more subdued version of this season's milkmaid dress trend. Brands like D√¥en and LoveShackFancy have been spearheading the square-neck, puff-sleeved, and ethereal dresses taking over Instagram. For those who don't want to embrace the full-on milkmaid look though, Reformation's Lacey dress makes for the perfect middle-ground.  Of course, this Reformation dress isn't the only one emerging as an It item this summer. The shirred green Faithfull the Brand dress Irina Shayk stepped out in last week has also been making the rounds of the fashion set. And buzzy accessories like Jacquemus' fringe beach bag and naked sandals have also been rapidly taking over. So which one will reign supreme for Summer '19? The season is (technically) just getting started so we'll have to wait to see...  
 Princess Charlene of Monaco and Princess Victoria of Sweden have also worn the wardrobe staple.  Since marrying Prince Harry in May, Meghan Markle has been busy crafting her own style as the Duchess of Sussex‚Äîbut that's not to say she's taking notes from other chic royals too.  While on the 16-day royal tour of Australia, Fiji, Tonga, and New Zealand with Prince Harry, the Duchess of Sussex has made a staggering number of outfit changes so far. But one of her most recent looks, a Fiji blue dress by Veronica Beard, offered up a welcomed splash of color and is a staple from many stylish royal's wardrobes.     The blue shirtdress, while not a groundbreaking revolutionary piece, has similarly been worn by both Princess Charlene of Monaco and Princess Victoria of Sweden in the past (though both opted for a light blue colors). Given its versatility and instantly put-together look, it's no surprise that the style has become a regular go-to for royal women.    Though not directly a royal herself, Kate Middleton's younger sister Pippa has also been spotted wearing a blue shirtdress on several occasions. Most recently, the younger Middleton wore a striped blue Polo Ralph Lauren shirtdress to Wimbledon while pregnant. She was also spotted riding a bike this summer in another blue shirtdress with a floral pattern.  Whether they're all taking notes from each other's style or not, Meghan, Charlene, Victoria, and Pippa are reminding us all that shirtdresses are the ultimate wardrobe classic‚Äîeven if you're not a royal. 
 It's time to put Miansai on your radar‚Äîand in your shopping cart.  Fashion's ongoing love of necklace layering shows no signs of slowing down. From mixing metals to personalized pendants, building just the right multi-necklace formula is an art form‚Äîand one that jewelry brand Miansai has been mastering for years.  The Miami-based brand, which designs both men and women's jewelry (most of which are interchangeably unisex), is known for its minimal, architectural-inspired pieces that offer quality without breaking the bank. So it's no surprise that it's become an under-the-radar favorite of celebrities and fashion insiders alike.   More is more with our newest pendants. Available for both men and women in silver and gold vermeil. #miansai #elevatedaesthetics A post shared by  Miansai (@miansai) on May 18, 2019 at 11:54am PDT Despite the fact that Miansai started as a men's jewelry brand, its pieces unsurprisingly caught the eye of many stylish women along the way‚Äîleading to the launch of its women's collection. Namely, the layering-friendly necklaces, which range from classic chains to personalized monogram pendants, saints, and layered charms, are what really won the fashion girls over. When worn together, it's nearly impossible for the varying pieces not to create the perfect necklace mix.  Of course, the brand is also known for its minimal cuff bracelets‚Äîfor both men and women‚Äîalong with a budding range of fashion pieces including hoop earrings and sunglass chains.  The secret sauce behind it all is the husband and wife duo who runs the show. Founder and creative director Michael Saiger launched Miansai out of his college dorm room back in 2008, due to the lack of men's jewelry choices out there. He wanted to create a brand that took the taboo away from men wearing jewelry. Years later, Saiger met his now-wife Rachael Russell Saiger, who he tapped as the brand's fashion director to oversee the expansion into women's and more fashion-driven pieces.  The couple created the ultimate home for Miansai's headquarters in the heart of Miami's Wynwood District. And what started as men's rope and anchor bracelets, has quickly blossomed into much more‚Äîincluding fine jewelry. Together, they've managed to grow a brand that appeals to both men and women‚Äîa tough niche to crack in the jewelry world.  
 The 'Mrs. Maisel' actress is the face of Frances Valentine, Spade's accessories line named after her daughter. The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel star Rachel Brosnahan, niece of the late Kate Spade, stars in a new campaign honoring the designer, who passed away last June. The campaign is for Frances Valentine, an accessories line launched by Spade and her husband Andy in 2016, which was named after their daughter.  Brosnahan announced the news on Today this morning, telling Hoda Kotb, "It‚Äôs really lovely to see those special pieces of our family reflected through this collection and the ones before.‚Äù  She also reflected about her aunt, adding, ‚ÄúWhen you lose someone you love very, very much, you spend a lot of time trying to think about how to keep their spirit alive‚Ä¶ There is so much of her left behind and this was an opportunity for us to celebrate her life and her legacy.‚Äù The campaign, shot by Cepis, shows Brosnahan in bold, playful, and colorful looks, emulating Spade's whimsical and chic personal style, while sporting bags, shoes, and jewelry from the Frances Valentine Spring 2019 collection. The actress even has her brunette hair styled in Spade's signature updo.   In one shot, she wears a yellow satchel called the Midge, named after her character in The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel. The design was released in 2017, WWD reports.  
  Brosnahan has paid tribute to her aunt Kate, whom she endearingly referred to as Katy, multiple times on Instagram since her passing. Days after her death, the actress recalled fond memories of Spade by posting a video of her dancing on Instagram.  "She had a light that words can‚Äôt capture but touched everyone she came into contact with," she captioned the post. "She was exceedingly kind, beautifully sensitive, insanely talented, funny as heck and one of the most generous people I have ever known. She was effervescent. Hug your loved ones extra tight today." Watch Brosnahan's campaign video for Frances Valentine below:

 Whether they're brand spanking new, expanding or collaborating, these were the freshest kids on the block for Fall 2018... From international sensations to artistic collaborations, these were the names to watch for Fall 2018... Founder Danita Short and Creative Director Christian Juul Nielsen are inspired by "Rock ‚Äòn‚Äô Roll, motorcycle culture and the raw energy of the 1970s." Nielsen hails from giant labels like Lacroix and Dior in both ready to wear and couture‚Äîbut the brand's collection is decidedly cool yet approachable. Think: wide whale corduroy suits in breezy '70s hues with exaggerated proportions. The LA based label already has celebs like Kate Bosworth on-board.  Not every newbie graduated from design school last semester. Sandra Sandor launched Budapest-based Nanushka in 2005. The sustainably-minded brand has recently become an It girl go-to and showed for the first time at NYFW for Fall 2018. The minimal meets pretty wares are just what closets everywhere have been needing. Rebecca de Ravenel caused a jewelry sensation with her playful, lightweight bonbons. Last season, the designer touched a toe in ready to wear with a collection of caftans‚Äîgoing full bore for Fall 2018 with '30s influenced, decidedly rich-looking, ultra-feminine printed dresses and separates. It's an aesthetic that feels right on time. BEVZA debuted last season with "realatics" making a political statement about war torn Ukraine, where the brand is based. This season the designer had furry ones in mind, showing coats that look like fur but are actually trompe l'oeil puffers‚Äînamed after some fictional fur lovers like Carrie Bradshaw and Margot Tennenbaum. Big brands embracing the underground designers reworking their wares is a trend we can get behind. Artistic young thing Dani√´lle Cathari has taken on adidas on her own accord, and now the brand has given her free reign with classic Originals icons, adicolor and adibreak. The results are cooler than cool tracksuits, turtlenecks, sweatshirts and more. Campaign face Kendall Jenner has already taken them to the streets. Though beloved in their native Denmark and often the answer to the question, "OMG what is that coat?" Saks Potts have, in fact, just showed for the first time in NYC. The candy-colored toppers, playful polka dots and dreamy trenches were instant hits on the street style set and have legs far beyond fashion week.

From '80s-inspired pieces to asymmetrical earrings, bold necklaces, and beyond, the Fall 2018 collections are letting the jewels do all the talking. From New York to London, Milan, and Paris, we're tracking all the best jewelry spotted on the runways.

Plus, rumors that Hailey Baldwin will make her debut at the show this season continue to circle.

 What to watch for at this season's shows.  As designers experiment with the traditional runway format, the landscape at New York Fashion Week continues to change drastically. From brands heading to Paris to those skipping runway shows altogether, changes are (still) coming to NYFW in full force. Ahead of the Fall 2018 collections, here's your guide for what to watch this New York Fashion Week.  While the fashion industry still has a long, long way to go, last September marked the most diverse runway season ever. After monitoring 94 shows in New York, The Fashion Spot found the Spring 2018 runways featured 36.9% women of color and for the first time ever, every single show cast at least two women of color. Body diversity, age diversity, and transgender representation also increased dramatically last season, marking a change for many major fashion houses. Hopefully, brands will continue to recognize the importance of diversity and representation on the runway and break last season's record...  Pictured: Tome Spring 2018 Kors‚Äô always-anticipated shows pays homage to the Big Apple. From the venue‚Äîthe Vivian Beaumont Theater at Lincoln Center‚Äîto the invitations and artwork, designed by legendary theater-poster artist James McMullan, the show is taking a bow to Kors adopted hometown. ‚ÄúI wanted the show to be a love letter to New York,‚Äù the designer explains. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm inspired by everything about the city‚Äîthe electricity, the speed, the diversity, the individuality, and of course the art and food and fashion. So much of New York is iconic, from the architecture to the theater to the faces, and anyone who‚Äôs ever been here has their own New York story. During a time when many designers are opting to leave New York, Bottega Veneta is instead bringing its Fall 2018 collection here to help celebrate the launch of its new flagship store. The Italian fashion house will skip its Milan show for a spot on the NYFW calendar this season, holding a special co-ed show on February 9‚Äîthe same day the largest Bottega Veneta store in the world opens on 64th street and Madison Avenue.  Shaking up the entire fashion calendar, Alexander Wang announced that this February would be his final time showing during the traditional New York Fashion Week shows. Moving forward, the designer will present two collections a year in June and December to better align with his production schedule. Wang, who typically hosts the biggest after-parties and #WangFest, will be hosting his final February show in Times Square.  As brands continue to experiment with runway shows vs. intimate presentations, many are taking a different route this season: mixing fine dining with fashion. Gabriela Hearst will present her Fall 2018 collection at Caf√© Altro Paradiso, while J.Mendel will show its collection at Ladur√©e in Soho. Similarly, Derek Lam is hosting intimate lunches at The Pool in lieu of a runway.  Following her debut at Calvin Klein's Spring 2018 show, Kaia Gerber went on to take over the runways in London, Milan, and Paris in her first ever runway season‚Äîmost recently hitting the Chanel Haute Couture catwalk. The 16-year-old is still the one to watch this February, cementing her status as the next big supermodel-in-the-making.

Helmed by Sandra Sandor, Nanushka will show its Fall 2018 collection with a presentation on February 11. Though it may be most-known for its It-girl-approved leather puffer jacket, this rising brand is certainly one to watch. As Eugenia Kim celebrates its 20th year anniversary, the accessories brand will mark the occasion with a special retrospective presentation and capsule collection. Featuring some of Kim's most iconic hats over the years, the capsule will bring back some of the brand's greatest archival pieces. Expect to see hats worn by pop royalty back in the early '00s as well as pieces featured in the movie Zoolander and worn today by the likes of Kate Middleton and Beyonc√©.   In honor of the highly-anticipated Black Panther movie, Marvel Studios tapped seven designers to create looks inspired by the film's fashion. CHROMAT, Cushnie et Ochs, Fear of God, Ikir√© Jones, Laquan Smith, Sophie Theallet, and Tome each designed one-of-a-kind pieces influenced by themes and characters of the movie. The looks will be unveiled at "Welcome to WAKANDA," an immersive event held on February 12 in the midst of New York Fashion Week. Each of the looks will be auctioned off via Charitybuzz.com to support Save the Children.

A post shared by  Lela Rose (@lelarose) on Feb 2, 2018 at 2:10pm PST In lieu of a traditional runway setting, Lela Rose is debuting her latest collection in the form of an Instagram show. The designer tapped 10 of her favorite influencers to style and  model looks from the Fall 2018 collection, which each will share to their own Instagram accounts on February 8.  After skipping last season, Narciso Rodriguez is returning to New York Fashion Week in time for its 20th year anniversary. The brand, which just debuted a special archival capsule collection for the occasion, will show on February 7.  Following past season CFDA initiatives for Planned Parenthood and the ACLU, an official cause for this season's shows has yet to be formally announced. On Saturday, however, designers banded together for a pre-NYFW party dubbed ‚ÄúTogether We Rise x NYFW.‚Äù Featuring speakers from the Women's March and Planned Parenthood, the event sought to create awareness about women in leadership as well as the upcoming midterm elections. Designers including Gabriela Hearst, Ulla Johnson, Brandon Maxwell, and more each created a special item to benefit Planned Parenthood & The Women‚Äôs March for the occasion‚Äîall available to shop here.  Between the ongoing political climate and the #TimesUp and #MeToo movements amongst women, it would be surprising for designers not to make some sort of statement with their shows this season.

 Welcome back, Queen.  Tonight marks an important night in fashion: not only is it the 2018 Met Gala, but Kate Moss is also back in New York for the first time in nearly a decade.  Marking her first Met Gala appearance since 2009 (when she co-hosted alongside Marc Jacobs and Justin Timberlake), the supermodel made a triumphant return to the event tonight in a feathered little black dress by Saint Laurent.  She was spotted leaving her hotel, giving us a sneak-peek at her look before she arrives on the red carpet.  The theme for this year's Met Gala, Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination, explores the intersection of fashion and Catholicism. While Kate's Anthony Vaccarello-designed dress didn't take the theme too literally, she certainly looks heavenly and that's all the religion I need.  Earlier today, the supermodel made the ultimate return to the states by posing in a 'Make America Kate Again' moto jacket by Alyson Eastman on Instagram.    #makeamericakateagain #katemoss Welcome back Kate!!! üñ§üñ§üñ§üñ§üñ§üñ§üñ§üñ§üñ§üñ§ A post shared by  Robert Rich (@rrichnyc) on May 7, 2018 at 5:27am PDT
 ‚ÄúSometimes I say I need Viagra for shoots. It‚Äôs harder to get it up.‚Äù This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. Iconic supermodel Cindy Crawford is helping us look forward to our fifties with her incredible attitude to aging.  Speaking at an event with WWD and Greg Renker, with whom she built the brand  Meaningful Beauty, Crawford discussed modeling in her fifties.  She revealed why, alongside her supermodel friend, Christy Turlington, she feels it‚Äôs important to still do photo shoots. She explained, ‚ÄúWe want to show women who are 53, and I think Christy just turned 50, that there‚Äôs still beauty in that.‚Äù And this includes taking ‚Äútasteful nudes,‚Äù which Crawford recently did for famed photographer Russell James‚Äôs book. A post shared by Cindy Crawford (@cindycrawford) on Feb 17, 2019 at 8:14am PST She explained, "I remember some snarky person on Instagram‚Äîthere seem to be a lot of those‚Äîposted something like, ‚ÄòAh, why are you still doing those at your age?‚Äô And I was like, is there an age where being nude isn‚Äôt beautiful? It‚Äôs just a different kind of beauty."  According to WWD, Crawford noted the importance of women treating themselves as kindly as they would their friends. ‚ÄúThat is part of the reason I still do shoots,‚Äù she added. The legendary supermodel does admit that it‚Äôs now ‚Äúa little harder" though, as she joked, ‚ÄúI hope this is politically correct, but sometimes I say I need Viagra for shoots. It‚Äôs harder to get it up.‚Äù A post shared by Cindy Crawford (@cindycrawford) on Apr 17, 2019 at 9:45am PDT On her own skincare secrets, Crawford said of Meaningful Beauty, "Using it daily, along with avoiding the sun, not smoking, drinking a lot of water, and getting enough sleep is key to looking and feeling good at any age." And clearly, confidence‚Äìas much as genetics‚Äìgoes a long way.

 "It's all diamonds‚Äîwhich is perfect for me." As if the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show wasn't tough competition as it is‚Äîeach year the girls compete for three coveted positions in the lingerie extravaganza: the show opener, the Swarosvki outfit and the Fantasy Bra.  In the last three years, Elsa Hosk has clearly become a favorite with all the right people at Victoria's Secret. The Swedish stunner who has been working with Victoria Secret since 2011, was named the lucky model to wear this year's fantasy bra. Ticking off another bucket list item.  Hosk first started off as a VS Pink ambassador, and in 2014 she was officially given her first set of wings and the title of Victoria Secret Angel. In 2016 she had the honor of opening the runway show in Paris. In 2017 for the Shanghai show, Hosk wore the Swarovski outfit (a one-of-a-kind crystal-embellished outfit designed for one Angel). This year the Dream Girls Fantasy Bra is all hers. "This is the fantasy bra! Holy sh‚Äît!" was Hosk's first reaction to seeing her custom bra. "It's one of the most beautiful fantasy bras I've ever seen in my career‚Äîand it fits my personal style so well. It's very understated, but glamorous, it has a real '90s throwback vibe to it. And it's all diamonds‚Äîwhich is perfect for me." This year's fantasy bra was designed by Swarovski and is comprised of 21,000 diamonds. It's valued at a cool $1 million dollars. It took 4 craftsman and 930 hours to create this piece of lingerie. Hosk will also wear a coordinating Swarovski by Christopher Kane crystal necklace and bangles to accent her look for the show on Thursday. For the first time, customers will be able to buy a similar, albeit much less expensive version of this fantasy bra for $250 on November 29th.  "Where am I going to go from here?" Hosk joked when asked what was left on her career to-do list? "I was just telling my agents in a meeting that there's still a lot of photographers I want to work with, and I think there's a new generation of photographers that are coming up, and their style is really cool and different. But I'm so thankful for each and every opportunity I've had." With just 3 days to go until the big show returns to its origins in New York City, the model said she's been switching things up in terms of her show prep. "Every year I like to try something new, so this year I've been working with Megan Roup. It's a dance-based workout, but you're not really learning a dance‚ÄîI'm terrible at choreography. Megan makes it really easy, and fun. As I get older, I want a workout that maximizes my time doing as little as possible, with maximum results. This does it for me." 
 Ever wonder how your favorite editors get dressed for work? These are the stories (and price tags) behind their impeccable outfits. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. In this week's episode of This Look is Money, we tracked down three fashion editors from two of your favorite online style destinations to reveal precisely how they put together their best outfits. Think covetable and eye-grabbing pieces‚Äîone editor even waited in line for two hours so she could score her dream handbag at a sample sale.  From looking "rich and spicy" in a cardigan that costs just as much as your half of the rent to sporting accessories from emerging talent from across the globe, these fashion tastemakers are the new go-to for your style inspiration. Who are you wearing? How much did it cost? What favors are you calling in? Think: something old, something new, something borrowed, and something bought resale.    First up is Nikki Ogunnaike, the style director of ELLE.com. She once finessed her love for J.Crew into a successful social media campaign that landed her a modeling spot in their holiday catalog. So you know you're in for some major style inspiration ahead.  Starting from her shoes up, Ogunnaike is sporting a pair of white leather Kenneth Cole boots ($150) that "have a nice, walkable heels I can get around town in them super easily, and I don't feel like I'm hobbling across the street," she says.  Ogunnaike's dark wash Rag & Bone jeans ($150) are "perfection" because her pair is stiff and she doesn't have to hem them. Plus, the unique cuff and logo down the sides of the jeans caught her attention. She admits that her black Balenciaga cardigan ($1,390) is a splurge, but "if you work hard, and you want to spend your money and treat yourself, [then] you should," Ogunnaike adds. She's been searching for her gold Celine by Phoebe Philo "O" initial necklace "for years," and when she saw it in Barney's she knew it was meant to be ($500). "Now that I'm in my mid-30s, I believe I'm a grown ass woman, and it's time to invest in some gold jewelry," she declares while pointing at her two rings from Mejuri ($250 total).   To look stylish and stay warm in the winter, Ogunnaike relies on her red puffer jacket by Canadian retailer Aritzia ($230), who also counts Duchess Meghan Markle as a fan.  Ogunnaike shares that she has nine ear piercings and believes it‚Äôs "a really great way to mix up your jewelry game, but not have to do a lot," she says of her pieces from direct-to-consumer brands The Last Line, Vrai & Oro, and SVNR. As for the cost of her investment earrings: "Yikes! [...] I spend a lot of money on clothes. What do you want me to do," she admits. Ogunnaike adds that her two small gold hoops with freshwater pearls from SVNR cost $250 a piece ($500 total). "I'm so happy to own them just because I'm supporting a female designer, and we gotta do that," she says. Outfit Total: $3,170   Lauren Alexis Fisher is the market editor of HarpersBAZAAR.com, which means she's an expert at spotting trends from both established and emerging brands. She recently launched "Fishing For Answers," her weekly life advice column that tackles readers' most pressing questions about fashion, career, relationships, and general advice. Here, Fisher makes her case for investing in chic outerwear and shoes to elevate your wardrobe to help you look like the most expensive version of yourself. Fisher's oversized camel Aritzia coat ($300) is a classic wardrobe staple that helps her embody cozy-girl chic in the winter. Her slouchy leather black kitten heel boots are from Neil J. Rodgers' eponymous line. "I love them because they're the perfect slouch. It's a small heel, so I can run around and wear them all day if I need to," she says of her functional $675 purchase. Her high-waisted black trousers from Lou & Grey ($60) are an affordable option for a classic, everyday style staple. "You can wear them with anything in your wardrobe, and they look instantly chic," Fisher says. She notes that she adores the printed turtleneck trend this season, and waited until she found an affordable-yet-stylish option. Her snakeskin-printed top is $18 from H&M. "I'm always looking for new bags and accessories designers, and I'm really excited I found this one," she says of her Alfeya Valrina purse.  "She makes these really great mini handbags that are fun little pops of color to add into your wardrobe."  Fisher's small hoop earrings are from Sarah Chloe ($196), and she appreciates that they are chic and multifunctional. "I love them because you can take the pearl on and off the hoops, so you can wear them two different ways. It's like two earrings in one," she says.   Finishing up her look is a pair of '90s-inspired sunglasses from Quay Australia that are "a mix of classic and trendy. These are a little bit '90s but they still feel classic enough to wear even when the '90s trend dies down. If it ever does," she adds.  Outfit Total: $1,544   ‚ÄúI really look for pieces I can wear multiple times, like really great sweaters,‚Äù says Tara Lamont-Djite, fashion director of HearstMade. Lamont-Djite embodies sophisticated, minimal-chic style, so it‚Äôs no wonder she knows how to mix and match pieces in her wardrobe to wear throughout the year including silk slip dresses. She sports a Kate Moss-inspired slip dress from one of her favorite labels, Organic by John Patrick ($250), that is "the perfect length to go with boots." To wear her dress as a skirt, she layered a black mock neck fine knit top from Aritzia ($120) over the dress. "I love to go there because sometimes you can find some really unexpected, super amazing things," Lamont-Djite says of the store. Her black kitten heel Stuart Weitzman booties ($90) are a vintage find from the '90s on eBay. The struggle was real when Lamont-Djite was searching for a full-length houndstooth coat. Thankfully, she found one from Suistudio ($500) that made her "really excited" about her investment purchase.  Lamont-Djite is carrying a textured leather handle bag from Mark Cross. While her particular handbag retails for $3,000, she patiently waited in line for two hours to score her bag at a sample sale for $600. To satisfy her appetite for freshwater pearl jewelry, Lamont-Djite wore a pair of gold-tone oblique earrings with baroque pearl accents from Alighieri, a line inspired by poet Dante Alighieri.

 This triple camera in the iPhone 11 Pro came to play. Tim Cook took the Steve Jobs stage in Cupertino, California on Tuesday morning to announce the Next Big Thing from Apple: a new iPhone model called the iPhone 11‚Äîwhich is not an extension of the two-year-running iPhone X series, but is a successor to the iPhone XR, with an upgraded dual camera. For those looking for a follow-up to the iPhone XR, the iPhone 11 looks like your winner‚Äîand it costs just $699. Apple also introduced the iPhone 11 Pro with a 5.8-inch OLED display and the iPhone 11 Pro Max with a 6.5-inch OLED display, both with a hefty triple camera that is certainly the most enticing selling point. That means the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max have a telephoto camera, an ultra-wide camera, and a wide camera on the back of the phone. They'll go for $999 and $1,099 respectively, and will launch with the iPhone 11 on September 20. Apple had a lot to live up to with this Keynote announcement. All of its recent phones are priced at or above $1,000 besides last year's iPhone XR, which came pretty damn near close with a starting price of $749. But despite the price tag, Apple has lagged behind some Android phones, especially in terms of camera capability. In 2016, Apple introduced Portrait Mode to the iPhone 7 Plus, but that was the last update to really make a buzz. Last year, Apple kicked up the camera capabilities in the iPhone Xs, Xs Max, and XR, but it still was outperformed by the Google Pixel 3 and the Samsung Galaxy S10+, for example. Apple no longer has a monopoly on really good smartphones, and even though the company is still pulling in major money, iPhone sales aren‚Äôt what they used to be, because most people can‚Äôt afford to or are uninterested in pouring big money into an upgrade every year or two. And even though the hype surrounding this Keynote (and, to be fair, every single Apple event) is considerable, the tech experts are already looking ahead to 2020, when Apple is expected to seriously revamp the iPhone's design, and upgrade it to work on the still-infant 5G network.   Should you want a phone upgrade, stay tuned for more information on the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro. Here's what we learned at the Keynote. The iPhone 11 is the cheapest phone Apple debuted at its Keynote‚Äîby a lot. It costs just $699 to start, and it comes with a 6.1-inch Retina display and new, fun colors: purple green, red, black, white, and yellow. Its dual camera has a few updates, like wide and ultra-wide cameras that you can switch between while taking a photo without sacrificing quality. The same goes for video mode, which supports 4K up to 60 fps.  Plus, Apple added Night Mode to improve low-light picture taking, which Apple has struggled with in the past. For selfie enthusiasts, the front camera now has slow-mo mode, too.  The iPhone 11 comes with Apple's new A13 Bionic chip to improve speed and performance; Apple says it's the fastest chip ever in a smartphone. The battery life lasts an hour longer than the iPhone XR. It will be available to purchase on September 20. The big news with the iPhone 11 Pro is its triple camera, the Pro Camera. This thing is big, taking up a good chunk of the back of the phone with a wide, ultra-wide, and telephoto camera. You can take photos with all three cameras from one vantage point. Additionally, the triple camera supports Night Mode and impressive video-taking features. The 5.8-inch iPhone 11 Pro will start at $999, and the 6.5-inch iPhone 11 Pro Max will start at $1,099‚Äîand the absence of a huge price jump is refreshing for Apple. The OLED screens have the highest pixel density on an iPhone yet, which Apple dubbed the Super Retina XDR display. The iPhone 11 Pro models have that same A13 Bionic chip for speed and efficiency, and battery life for both is longer than the iPhone Xs models. They come in space grey, silver, gold, and a very cool midnight green. It will be available to purchase on September 20. Of course, this wasn‚Äôt just an iPhone event. Apple announced the launch of Apple Arcade, its new subscription-based video game series that will have exclusive content from a variety of big-name and indie game developers. Apple Arcade will hit the App Store on September 19. Apple TV+, which has huge celebrity talent from the likes of Jason Momoa, Oprah, Jennifer Anniston, and Steve Carrell, will debut on November 1. Both cost just $4.99 per month. In terms of gear, Apple revealed a new seventh-generation iPad with a 10.2‚Äù Retina display and upgraded speed to compete directly with PC laptops. Plus, the enclosure is made with all recycled materials. It starts at $329. For the health trackers, Apple Watch Series 5 was debuted, with a display that never goes dark and improved features, starting at $399.

 Add this to your mood board ASAP.  For the latest installment of the #MyCalvins campaign, Calvin Klein tapped the entire A$AP Mob group as the newest faces of its denim and underwear lines. Starring A$AP Rocky, A$AP Ferg, A$AP Nast, A$AP Twelvyy, A$AP Ant, A$AP Lou and A$AP J. Scott, the hip-hop crew appears in the ultimate group shot photographed by Willy Vanderperre along with a behind-the-scenes video.  In the 30-second video, the rappers dance, goof off and talk style while wearing classic pieces from the Calvin Klein Denim and Calvin Klein Underwear lines. When the whole group tries to sync up to declare the brand's iconic tagline "My Calvins," A$AP Rocky accidentally drops the ball and says "Our Calvins" instead‚Äîmaking for the cutest moment of the video.  This, of course, is hardly the first time the stylish group of rappers has dipped their toes into the fashion world. The always well-dressed A$AP Rocky has several campaigns under his belt already for Dior Homme, DKNY and more. A$AP Ferg, meanwhile, actually studied fashion design in school and launched his own brand, Devoni Clothing, back in 2005.  The A$AP Mob ads are part of Calvin Klein's newly-launched #MyCalvins campaign for Spring 2018, which centers around the theme of family and unity. Solange kicked off the campaign series last month with her "musical family" including singers and songwriters Dev Hynes (better known as Blood Orange), Kelela, Caroline Polachek and Adam Bainbridge of Kindness. The brand will continue to roll out more of its "Our Family" ads throughout the Spring 2018 season. 
 Hello, 911? I'd like to report a slaying.  If you thought Bella Hadid's runway looks at the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show were sexy, please check the batteries on your Life Alert before scrolling. The model brought the heat up a few thousand notches with not one, but two naked dresses at the after party.  Trading in her wings from the lingerie-filled runway, Bella showed up to the VS after party in a plunging and sparkling silver gown. The ultra sexy, ultra see-through look featured a thigh-high slit and halter neckline. Underneath, she wore nothing but a black thong, as you do after walking the biggest lingerie show in the world. If you're having trouble lifting your jaw off the ground, I unfortunately don't have medical advice for you. But here's a photo of Bella looking completely flawless from another angle while you gather yourself: Just in case one super sexy naked gown wasn't enough, the model changed into another sheer look while leaving the party with her boyfriend, The Weeknd, Halsey, and a group of friends. For her final naked outfit of the night, she wore a nude August Getty Atelier sheer mini dress with a pair of high-top sneakers. She kept the same accessories for her outfit change: a stunning pair of emerald earrings and a sparkly silver clutch.    Earlier in the night, Bella walked the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show for the third year in a row. The model wore a total of two looks in the lineup, the first was a sporty black and white lingerie set topped off with a cropped bomber jacket and sock boots.  And the second featured icy blue angel wings, lingerie, and matching feathered heels.  So, in conclusion, the real takeaway here is that it doesn't matter if Bella is on the Victoria's Secret runway, red carpet, or walking down a New York street at 2 AM, she looks like complete FIRE no matter what. Thank you for coming to my TED Talk. 
 The model-actress is killing the daywear fashion scene... New mom, model, actress and, apparently, serious street style star Rosie Huntington Whiteley's recent looks, captured by paps on the streets of NYC and LA are what fashion mood boards are made of. Never over the top, with a mix of established designers and emerging names, Huntington-Whiteley is quite literally killing the style game. Get inspired and shop the standout pieces.                               It's clear the Brit loves a good plaid, but it's this structured black hat that's tipping the scales of this look from chic to very chic. A cool mix of textures and fabrics makes this hat more luxe than its counterparts. The balance of leather shorts and a flowing floral top illustrate how a little edge and a little romanticism come together perfectly.  Let this layering piece take the¬†place of a jacket this spring. A great jacket and leather leggings make for ideal transition wear‚Äîand a basic black turtleneck makes for a layering piece you'll want to wear over and over again. Consider it a collector's item. A bold blue jacket with wide shoulders makes a major entrance. Skinny black trousers and a chain bag complete the look.  Your boyfriend's jacket done better. Huntinton-Whiteley is clearly a fan of leopard. This cropped jacket, belted at the waist, is an example of the statement print worn at full impact.  Because it's always better in leopard. We love the tones at play here, from vibrant red leather pants to a brick hued jacket‚Äîgrounded by very cool white boots. Lighten up, literally. A blue and white polka dot top brings this mini skirt, blazer, cowboy boot look to life.  This top works with jeans for a casual moment¬†or a trouser for something more dressed up. Clearly a closet staple for the LA-based model, a great belt takes her style miles. Why not wear one over a printed jacket and patent pants? When in doubt, cinch it. We practically swoon for this gray double-breasted suit with wide leg trousers, but before we go any further we must acknowledge these major sunnies. The bigger and darker the better for this blonde.  These are some confident sunnies. A logo waist bag is one of the looks of the season. We love it used to pull this robe coat together.  For when you need your phone and a double latte.

 Your chic predictor for the year ahead... 2019 is coming in with a bang‚Äîwith the swearing in of a more diverse and female House of Representatives and Senate (and all their chic looks), and with changes in the fashion-scape. From the shuttering of magazines to more designer musical-chairs, there are new labels, and an even stronger emphasis on social media in how we consume. These changes also mean that how trends begin and spread is altering, and the route to how brands emerge is constantly developing. In light of all that, there are new trends to play with, embrace, skip, abhor, or keep an eye on until you're ready for them. From the biker short to the cowboy boot, feathers, and tie-dye...

 You're going to want to book a vacation ASAP after seeing these pics.  While the rest of us are still recovering from our Thanksgiving-induced food comas, Kendall Jenner, Bella Hadid, and Hailey Baldwin are busy showing off their bikini bodies on a Bahamas vacation.  The models gathered a group of their girlfriends, including Justine Skye and Camila Morrone, for a quick beach getaway to the Caribbean island. And what would an It-girl-filled vacation be without picture-perfect Instagrams to give us all a severe case of FOMO? Jenner shared a group photo of the girls aboard a small yacht in the ocean to kick off the festivities.  Bella Hadid and Hailey Baldwin, meanwhile, posted solo shots of themselves in bikinis: Which, same.  Hadid took a moment to casually lay across a giant log in the water‚Äîas one of course does whilst soaking up the sun on vacation.  She also shared a photo of Hailey and Kendall gazing longingly aboard a yacht: The vacation was reportedly a special trip to celebrate Baldwin's 21st birthday, and by the looks of it, it was a pretty ideal way to ring in 21. 
 Posh-approved sneakers coming soon.  Victoria Beckham, the brains behind one of our time's most philosophical quotes, "I can't concentrate in flats!" is launching her most surprising endeavor yet: a partnership with Reebok.  Following a year of several collaborations, including a capsule collection for Target and an ongoing beauty partnership with Est√©e Lauder, the designer is now joining forces with a major sports brand for another new collection, marking her first foray into athletic wear. Although additional details of the Reebok x Victoria Beckham collection have yet to be revealed, it's likely the long-term partnership will include both apparel and footwear. If you have any doubts about how a pair of Reebok sneakers could get the Posh seal of approval, Beckham shared a sneak-peek posing in the brand's Club C sneakers on Instagram.    "Having the opportunity to realize my aesthetic within a sportswear environment is something that I have long wanted to do, Beckham said in a statement from the brand."Partnering with Reebok will enable me to further promote my vision in a new category. It‚Äôs incredibly exciting to work with such an iconic brand that epitomizes my belief in encouraging women to be the best version of themselves." While the designer has already mastered chic suiting, polished outerwear, and sleek accessories within her own namesake brand, we could all use a little bit of her signature style to spice up our athleisure looks, too. (Sorry, did you think you could make it through this article without a Spice Girls reference?) Beckham joins Reebok's growing list of inspiring female partners including Ariana Grande, Gigi Hadid, Aly Raisman and Teyana Taylor, in the brand's ongoing mission to empower women.

 She becomes the latest ambassador for the French fashion house. Emma Stone has just landed a lucrative deal as the new face of Louis Vuitton.  The Oscar-winning actress has reportedly signed a two-year contract with the French fashion house, estimated to be worth somewhere between $6 and $10 million.  Vuitton creative director Nicolas Ghesqui√®re confirmed the appointment on Instagram today. It was then followed by an announcement on the official Louis Vuitton account. As a face of the brand, the 28-year-old actress will star in worldwide TV and print campaigns, as well as wear the brand's clothing on the red carpet.  And she's started already, having worn a Louis Vuitton jacket and shirt dress to the premiere of Battle of the Sexes in LA earlier this month. Followed by a an embellished, ruffle-sleeve gown at the London premiere of the film. According to Page Six, the LVMH-owned company had been pursuing the star for nearly a year. Rumor has it that the brand has also been chasing Stone's La La Land co-star, Ryan Gosling, for the past three years, but to no avail, as the actor reportedly doesn't do endorsement deals.  Stone joins a list of other A-list actresses to work with the house, including Michelle Williams, Sophie Turner and Alicia Vikander.

 Everyone else can go home now. We've finally figured it out‚Äîthe only thing fiercer than Teyana Taylor's body is her runway walk. The singer (who's perhaps best known for starring in Kanye West's "Fade" video) graced the catwalk today for streetwear brand GCDS's presentation during New York Fashion Week, and she closed the show with a strut like no other.  Watch and be amazed:  The 26-year-old modeled an all-white ensemble, with a matching crop top and logo briefs, which perfectly accented her fit figure. She was also decked out in gold jewelry with oversized hoop earrings, layered necklaces, and chains wrapped around her waist. There were oversized sunglasses in the mix too, but Taylor quickly whipped them off on the runway with the sassiest execution known to man. Miranda Priestly could never. This isn't exactly Taylor's NYFW debut; the star also hit the runway last September for Kanye West's Yeezy Season 4 show.  Before tearing up the catwalk this morning, Taylor stopped by other NYFW events including the Kith Sport fashion show and Pat McGrath Mothership Ball. She met Naomi Campbell at the latter, and we wouldn't be surprised if she took some strutting tips from the supermodel for today's show. 
 These shoes were ACTUALLY made for walking. The idea of easy-to-walk-in, "comfortable" sandals may trigger visuals of orthopedic shoes with an unsightly strap and an awkward heel height. But gone are the days of painful, sky-high heels equaling sophistication and now, comfortable shoes have become surprisingly chic thanks to the resurgence of flat footwear trends like dad sneakers and casual flip flops.  We're happily welcoming ease into the mix with these on-trend, but comfortable and walkable sandals. Shop the most comfortable sandals of the season below.  It's time to give the flip flops and thong sandals of yesteryear a second chance. This summer, both casual styles are reemerging in buttery leather, dauntless hues and modern textures. Classic, polished and just trendy enough, the Limone thong sandal adds a modernized spin with soft leather and knot detailing.¬† For a very 2019 twist on simple rubber flip flops, opt for this leopard print pair.¬† In the latest "ugly" fashion craze, a sandal no one with a sartorial mind would have accepted just a few months ago is cool again. The best part about this tourist evolution is the versatility in which these travel-inspired sandals are created.  Stuart Weitzman is known for making comfortable footwear of all kinds, but these take the cake. Update the Birkenstock of your college years with decorative buckles and ruched straps.¬† Beachy-ready and easy to walk miles in, these luxe sandals are the investment your shoe rack needs.¬† Toe-loop details scream hot '90s teen, and that's all we could wish for in this current throwback phase. Don't be alarmed if this walkable sandal trend makes you yearn for spaghetti straps and rent-free living.  The Emilie sandal, crafted by up and coming must-have¬†brand Yubi Official,¬†features a toe loop and two crossover straps, creating a seriously sleek everyday sandal that elongates the legs.¬† For a simple sandal with glittering details that packs a subtle punch, look to these easy breezy braided black sandals, handmade by artisans in Greece.¬† Enter: mid-height wedges. They're high enough to give some leg, but low enough to stroll in for hours without an ounce of pain. The look you may lack in your favorite kitten heel can be found in one of these supportive and versatile sandals.  PVC has finally made its way into footwear; and we're absolutely here for it. Although these are slip on, you'll find the angle makes it¬†easy to keep your foot in place.¬† Both parts minimalistic and eye-catching, these easy white wedges will match everything in your wardrobe; from oversized pleated summer dresses to worn-in Levi's.¬†¬† Take your wardrobe to new heights this season with the coveted mule sandal. The fashion favorite mule has been reinvented time and time again, coming back each time in both luxurious options and affordable staples.  Crafted in Italy,¬†the Isa sandal are perfect for keeping up with the trends but unique enough to add some differentiation into the mix.¬† Because this mule has two straps and a block heel, they're beyond easy to walk in. And they're¬†made from '90s-inspired denim, they can be worn with virtually anything.¬†

 The model beautifully responds to bikini body scrutiny‚Äî12 days after giving birth. Supermodel Candice Swanepoel only gave birth to her second child a mere three weeks ago, but her postnatal ‚Äòbikini body‚Äô has already been at the receiving end of public scrutiny. In response to online criticism of her image on the beach, the Victoria‚Äôs Secret Angel took to Instagram Stories and shut down shamers with an empowering message.    Over paparazzi pictures of herself wearing a bikini, she wrote:    "This is me 12 days after having my son. If you have something bad to say about it‚Ä¶ check yourself. Society can be so cruel to one another. Beauty standards are sometimes impossible for women these days.‚Äù     #New Candice Swanepoel in your IG Stories üí• #candiceswanepoel. @angelcandices A post shared by  Candice Swanepoel Fanpage (@candiceswanarmy) on Jul 11, 2018 at 5:57am PDT She continued with a positive note: ‚ÄúI'm not ashamed to show my post-partum tummy. I am proud actually‚Ä¶ I carried my son for 9 months in there. I think I've earned the right to have a little tummy. Is it because I'm a model? Well we are normal people too, so let me enjoy the beach in peace please." Sharing another picture of herself while still pregnant with her second son, Swanepoel added: "I don't have to hide my stomach just because people have unrealistic standards of women. We create life‚Ä¶ what can you do? Ladies are all in this together. Be kind to each other." While Swanepoel's body is nobody else's business, she should be applauded for using this opportunity to share an important reality check which goes out to way more than her 12 million-plus followers.  Anyone: including women‚Äîprenatal, postnatal, or not‚Äîcan all learn from her self-acceptance and celebration.   Thank you so much for all the well wishes... Our little man was born this morning at home and he couldn‚Äôt be more perfect. üíï A post shared by  Candice Swanepoel (@angelcandices) on Jun 19, 2018 at 2:41pm PDT

 The brand's Cruise 2020 show marked its first collection without Karl Lagerfeld.  Virginie Viard worked alongside Karl Lagerfeld at Chanel for over 30 years, but today marked her first solo collection for the house since Lagerfeld's passing in February. Presenting the brand's Cruise 2020 show in Paris, Viard ushered in the next era of Chanel while staying true to Karl's vision.  Throughout his tenure at Chanel, Lagerfeld became known for his over-the-top runway sets and themes‚Äîfrom airports to supermarkets and beaches. For Cruise 2020, the fashion house staged its runway in a Beaux-Arts style train station‚Äîwith models walking on the train platform alongside the tracks. The show was held in Chanel's go-to Paris venue, the Grand Palais. And according to the brand, its train station set symbolized "the promise of an adventure."  Destination CHANEL ‚Äî the House chose to reveal its #CHANELCruise collection in a Beaux-Arts style train station. Like the promise of an adventure, the Grand Palais is transformed with railroad tracks over which one can picture trains setting off for sunny destinations. pic.twitter.com/TPUWH74S8F  With a total of 79 runway looks, Viard's first solo collection included fresh takes on Chanel signatures like tweed and suiting‚Äîstaying true to both Gabrielle "Coco" Chanel and Karl Lagerfeld's aesthetics. But in this new era of Chanel, femininity appears more prominent and was played up with a series of bows adorning blouses, belts, and dresses.  Several looks paid nod to the '80s‚Äîfrom bright colored jackets to Chanel logo pants and boxy tweed blazers.  For the woman heading to the French Riviera, a series of white pants, colorful striped sweaters, and a Jackie O-inspired bandana made appearances.  Pastels and poplins ruled another group of looks on the runway‚Äîranging from feminine suiting to ethereal print dresses.  Viard concluded with a series of looks done in the fashion house's classic white and black color palette. A range of 3-D floral applique dresses closed the show‚Äîacting as the real standouts of the collection.     And as always, it was all eyes on the new range of Chanel bags to debut. Viard introduced new elements to classic bags‚Äîlike a mini hoop handle done on the classic quilt bag.  Belt bags remained a staple this season‚Äîwith new tiny iterations and the introduction of a sportier double harness bag.  A tweed Chanel backpack featuring three leather pouches down the front also stood out from the pack.  And of course, there were plenty of new bright and colorful takes on the house's signature styles.  Many of Chanel's signature crowd attended the show‚Äîincluding Keira Knightley (who revealed her pregnancy), Lily Rose Depp, Vanessa Paradis, Caroline de Maigret, and Claudia Schiffer. Ali MacGraw, who stars in Chanel's latest watch campaign at 80 years old, was also notably in attendance.  
 The power of influencers. Logo It bags ruled the early 2000s as the ultimate must-have accessory.  And now, one of the decade‚Äôs most coveted, the Dior saddle bag, is officially making a comeback. Carried by everyone from Paris Hilton to Carrie Bradshaw and beyond, Dior's ubiquitous saddle bag ruled the early aughts‚Äîcementing its status as one of the key looks of the era. Though most often done in Dior's signature logo print, the It bag was offered in a wide array of styles, patterns and colors in its prime.  Carrie Bradshaw carrying a Dior saddle bag on Sex and the City, early 2000s: Now, thanks to the power of influencers and A-listers who've been sporting vintage styles of the bag on Instagram, the fashion house brought the iconic accessory back to the runway for its Fall 2018 show yesterday.  Though the show was mostly marked by its statement-making 1968 protest theme, nestled in the '60s-inspired collection were a few new iterations of the brand's saddle bag. Offered in black leather, the classic Dior logo and a new beaded version, the early 2000s must-have got a fresh makeover for its 2018 comeback.  Vintage styles of the Dior saddle bag have been quickly selling out on luxury resale sites like Vestiaire Collective and The RealReal for the past few months. The bag has been spotted on models like Bella Hadid and Elsa Hosk, along with a rising number of fashion bloggers on Instagram.

 Jeremy Scott announced the news at Coachella. H&M has just secured its next designer collaborator. Announcing the news at Coachella, Jeremy Scott revealed that he'd be working with the high street brand on a new collection. Scott revealed the news at the Moschino party, by projecting a call from Gigi Hadid onto the big screens at the event. H&M quickly confirmed the news on Instagram, revealing that the collection will launch on November 8, 2018. The brand wrote, "We told you to stand by‚Äîand now we can finally tell you. We're collaborating with fashion's most fun and charismatic brand, @MOSCHINO." Put the date in your diary, right now.  We told you to stand by ‚Äî and now we can finally tell you. We're collaborating with fashion's most fun and charismatic brand, @MOSCHINO ‚ù§Ô∏èüì∫ To be released 8 Nov 2018. ‚Äî REACT NOW at #HMOSCHINO A post shared by  H&M (@hm) on Apr 15, 2018 at 1:51am PDT According to an official press release, "H&M‚Äôs next designer collaboration is with MOSCHINO‚Äîthe iconic Italian brand to which Jeremy Scott has injected a new pop energy since he became Creative Director in 2013. The collection, MOSCHINO [tv] H&M, will be available online and in select H&M stores worldwide." Apparently the new collection, MOSCHINO [tv] H&M, is filled with "vitality, playfulness and humor," and comprises a "full range of accessories and some extra surprises too." H&M has previously worked with designers including Balmain, Karl Lagerfeld, Stella McCartney, Alexander Wang, Versace, Erdem, and Marni, and their collaboration with Moschino is likely to sell out quickly. Of the partnership, Scott revealed in a press release, "I am so excited about MOSCHINO [tv] H&M. My life's work has been to connect with people through fashion, and with this collaboration I‚Äôll be able to reach more of my fans than I‚Äôve ever had the ability to do."
 "It's really important to take advantage of a time like this." 23-year-old model Theodora Quinlivan (who goes by Teddy) is a regular at fashion show catwalks. Discovered by Louis Vuitton creative director Nicolas Ghesqui√®re in 2015, she's walked in and worked for campaigns from many of fashion's biggest names. But it's only now that she's shared her trans identity with others, and in an interview with CNN, Quinlivan explained why it felt so important for her to come out as trans now: Part of the reason, Quinlivan also shared, that she came out is because of the reported increase in violence against LGBTQ people in recent years, particularly against trans women of color: Quinlivan, who transitioned when she was 16, did share some of her anxieties about revealing her trans identity. She ultimately determined that in a world still short on trans role models, it was important for her to contribute to a narrative of visibility, working toward larger acceptance: Read the whole interview here, and watch a short film about Quinlivan's story below: Follow Lilian on Twitter.

 Models, designers, celebrities, and more pay tribute to the fashion legend.   The fashion world lost one of its most prominent figures today with the passing of Karl Lagerfeld. The designer, who was 85 years old, led a prolific career in fashion, most notably in his work as creative director at Chanel, Fendi, and his own namesake brand. His death was confirmed this morning in a statement from the house of Chanel.  Over the course of six-decade career, Lagerfeld touched the lives of those both in and out of the fashion world. From models to muses, designers, and celebrities, Lagerfeld left a lasting impact on everyone he worked with. As we reflect on the designer's incredible legacy, we're looking to all those paying tribute to him today.  From fellow designers like Donatella Versace and Virgil Abloh to legendary supermodels like Iman and Naomi Campbell, this is how the fashion world is honoring and remembering Karl Lagerfeld. House of Chanel Fendi  Karl Lagerfeld, the brand Glenda Bailey, Editor-in-Chief of Harper's BAZAAR Carine Roitfeld   Iman Linda Evangelista Naomi Campbell Gisele B√ºndchen Cindy Crawford Rihanna   Bella Hadid Gigi Hadid Victoria Beckham David Beckham Donatella Versace Carla Bruni Alber Elbaz Gwyneth Paltrow Marion Cotillard Adut Akech Lily Rose Depp Kaia Gerber Marc Jacobs  Waking up to a world without Karl.

 It's called FASHION, look it up.  As the Fall 2018 collections make their debut at New York Fashion Week, there's sure to be plenty of statement-making accessories hitting the runways‚Äîfrom boots to "Pussy Power" bags and beyond.  But at Chromat's Fall 2018 show, the most unexpected accessory in perhaps all of NYFW history hit the runway: Flamin' Hot Cheetos. Yes, Flamin' Hot Cheetos, the signature snack of Britney Jean Spears.  Redefining the art of pockets, a model walking the show used the bungee cord detailing on a pair of pants to hold a bag of Cheetos as she walked‚Äîand snacked‚Äîdown the runway, as one of course does.    This, my friends, is FASHUN and I am fully here for it.  Another model who didn't have the luxury of bungee cord pockets simply made do and carried her bag of Cheetos like this season's hottest clutch.  Aside from the flamin' hot snacks, however, Chromat also made waves at NYFW with its truly diverse, body positive, and inclusive lineup of models. Along with featuring models of various races and ethnicities, Chromat designer Becca McCharen-Tran also had several plus-size models walk the show.  The message of body positivity and acceptance did not go unnoticed.  Also joining in as a model was Viktoria Modesta, an amputee singer-songwriter who wore a prosthetic leg to walk the show.  From the laid-back vibes of accessorizing with Cheetos and pool noodles to the inclusive casting, Chromat's Fall 2018 show was a much-needed breath of fresh air  and positivity at New York Fashion Week. Here's to more brands following suit.

 The 2017 Love advent calendar is finally here.  Every year, Love Magazine gifts us all the ultimate holiday present: its super sexy advent calendar. Always featuring a model and star-studded cast, the 25-day video series has spotlighted everyone from Kim Kardashian West to Pamela Anderson and Bella Hadid in the past. Today, the magazine kicked off its 2017 calendar with the most model-filled workout video of all time.  And when I say model-filled, I mean model-filled. The Day 1 compilation video stars everyone from Emily Ratajkowski and Ashley Graham to Gigi and Bella Hadid to some of your favorite Victoria's Secret Angels. Directed by Phil Poynter, the workout-themed video celebrates strong, sexy women and features background vocals with the mantra, "Women are the wave of the future, stronger than anything."

There are a variety of workouts spotlighted like tennis, push-ups, lifting weights and more.  Plus, Bella Hadid flipping a giant tire as the grand finale.  The most heroic and relatable, however, is Emily Ratajkowski who opts to eat spaghetti for her workout of choice. Same, girl.  Now we just have to standby and see how the next 24 days of videos could possibly top Day 1. 
 The legendary actress is the new face of Gucci's timepieces and jewelry. Before she became a Hollywood actress and muse to Alfred Hitchcock, Tippi Hedren was a successful fashion model throughout the 1950s. Now, over fifty years later, the legendary actress is returning to her modeling roots as the face of Gucci's latest campaign.  At 88 years old, Hedren, who's mother to Melanie Griffith and grandmother to Dakota Johnson, stuns in the new ads for Gucci jewelry and timepieces. The icon stars as a mysterious fortune teller reading the palms and crystal balls of young models in the new campaign.  While reading a gold crystal ball, Hedren wears several layered gold bangles and bracelets along with the brand's snake-inspired rings. She also wears an Alessandro Michele-designed Gucci print dress.  SHOP GUCCI JEWELRY Gucci's casting of Hedren follows the industry's ongoing shift to embrace more age diverse campaigns. Last year, Lauren Hutton starred in ads for Calvin Klein Underwear at 73 years old‚Äîdefying the idea that only 20-something women could model bras and underwear. Previously, Gucci has also cast 79-year-old actress Vanessa Redgrave in one if its cruise campaigns.  Hedren's new modeling gig for Gucci is also somewhat of a family affair. The actress' granddaughter, Dakota Johnson, has previously starred in a campaign for Gucci's Bloom fragrance and has sat front row at many of the brand's runway shows due to her friendship with creative director Alessandro Michele.  The screen siren is most known for her roles in films like The Birds and Marnie. Her acting career was cut short following her working relationship with Hollywood director Alfred Hitchcock, whom the actress accused of harassment. At the height of the #MeToo and Time's Up movements last fall, the actress spoke out about her own abusive experiences in the industry that led her to walk away from the limelight. pic.twitter.com/cgyYTZtpaN

 See the singer's best looks.  Rihanna is just as much a sartorial risk taker as she is a musical hit maker.

 The Fifth Element actress is captivating... Balmain is thinking outside of the standard fashion box to get the word out on its Fall collection, rolling out to retail now. Considered "Volume 1" of a fresh communications strategy, the brand released an artful video starring actress Milla Jovovich, a project under creative director Olivier Rousteing, with a video directed by Jake Nava and photographed by An Le. "I seriously doubt that there could be a better fit than Milla for this campaign. There are so many reasons why," Rousteing explains. "She‚Äôs talented: She‚Äôs been a hero of mine since I watched (and re-watched) all of her films while growing up. Beyond being a singularly talented actor, she‚Äôs the perfect representative of the strong, confident and talented Balmain woman of today." The list goes on. "She‚Äôs beautiful," the social media savvy designer explains, "Milla is the embodiment of the glamour of the ‚Äò90s and she has a unique and compelling beauty that that absolutely fascinates me. Like Balmain, she manages to be both timeless and modern. She‚Äôs uniquely qualified for this project: For this collection, we wanted a new strong, message that honed in on the essential‚Äîand Milla helped us with that. Her confidence and talent comes through in each shot and in every movement of her performance." The video is a sound and movement experiment with all eyes on Jovovich. "Above all, I wanted to present this collection in a new and unexpected manner. My team and I decided to show these designs in the exact opposite way that they first were presented, many months ago, on the runway‚Äîand, instead, concentrate on a more intimate and compelling presentation in a completely distinct environment." For the actual process, Jovovich approached the experience with an actor's sensibility. "There was a choreographer on set that showed me some things I could do potentially, tapping my feet for instance, clapping, scraping the chair across the floor and using it in interesting ways to move around, rather than just sitting in it," the supermodel told BAZAAR.com.  But of course, it's still about the fashion. "Then when I got into the clothes, I started to visualize different types of movements I could do that would look striking and strong on camera, but that would also create some cool sounds. Jake Nava, the director, was wonderful as well because we were able to work very closely while I was being filmed. He would talk to me while I was on camera and let me know to stop for a few moments and let the camera get closer or move away and catch a particular pose or moment that he liked. He would tell me to take on different characters, expressions, give a smile, laugh." The campaign ended up being very much about a collaboration between the actress and the brand, "This is much more about Milla doing what she does best: performing,"Rousteing says, "It shows the collection while making very clear the connection between those designs and the beauty, strength and glamour of one of my favorite actors. I see this short film as a fresh and new way to complement the campaign‚Äôs images, giving a bit of the story behind each shot."
 The model talks holiday plans, gift giving, and her new design project for FAO Schwarz.  Gigi Hadid is channeling her inner kid to get in the holiday spirit this year. The supermodel is no stranger to design collaborations, but her latest ventures off the runway and into the toy realm for the reopening of New York's iconic FAO Schwarz.   Making for an unexpected collaboration, the famed toy store tapped Hadid to design new uniforms for the toy soldiers at its soon-to-be-opened New York flagship. Last night, the model (dressed in an equally playful Moschino suit) unveiled her designs at a FAO Schwarz event and later on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon.  "They‚Äôve never had someone come in and design the toy soldier uniforms," Hadid gushed to BAZAAR.com ahead of the event, "So the soldiers who greet the kids at the door and are the heart and soul of FAO Schwarz will be wearing my designs. It‚Äôs really cool because I grew up loving FAO Schwarz."  "I had one of the giant plush giraffe toys in my room," she recalled excitedly, "I remember going to the store as a kid and just running around, touching everything, and taking it all in. I think it‚Äôs really important to have a place for kids to go experience the fun of toys and discovery."  Hadid's newly-designed uniforms feature red double-breasted jackets with gold epaulettes covering the shoulders and a tall hat with gold detailing‚Äîincluding some mini FAO building blocks. On Instagram, she shared a behind-the-scenes look at some of her sketches for the project.   My inner child has been bursting with excitement and pride to be part of an ICONIC revival in #NYC : #ReturnToWonder ‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è Tune in to @fallontonight Tuesday night 10/23 as my friend @jimmyfallon helps me reveal a surprise @FAOSchwarz and I have been dying to share ‚ù§Ô∏èüóΩüéäüéñüòÅ A post shared by  Gigi Hadid (@gigihadid) on Oct 20, 2018 at 5:14am PDT Proving she's still a kid at heart, Gigi later danced on a replica of FAO Schwarz's famous giant piano and hugged a giant stuffed animal giraffe, similar to the one she owned growing up. For the occasion, she even got an FAO-themed manicure that paid homage to the same giraffe.    With the holidays quickly approaching, she also reflected on some of the Hadid family's favorite Christmas traditions‚Äîmaking us all want to get in the spirit early this year. As usual, she's planning on spending the holidays at her family's farm house.  "Holidays are always just with the family. We love going to the farm and we do a lot of cooking, hanging out, fire pits, and movie nights‚Äîstuff like that. It‚Äôs just a very calm time to be together and do fun things," she revealed. "We all cook something different on Christmas. I'm usually on pie duty, so I make like five different kinds of pies, but I always like to do something fun and random. One year I made Santa‚Äôs Sleigh out of candy and cupcakes, I love creative projects like that."   As for gifts, she's not exactly sure what she's giving everyone this year, but for her, personal gifts are the most important. "I love writing notes for the holidays. I do it for my family and also for everyone that I work with, I always send notes," she explained.  In fact, all of the Hadids like to participate in writing thoughtful letters to each other on the holidays. "It‚Äôs so funny because Christmas morning is not cute for us because we‚Äôre crying over everyone's really long notes. We‚Äôre always like ‚ÄòI‚Äôll read them later!! Don‚Äôt show me your note!!!‚Äù because we‚Äôll all cry. It‚Äôs like 'let‚Äôs open presents first and then we‚Äôll read them alone in our rooms by ourselves,'" she laughed.   ‚ù§Ô∏èWe may not have it all together but together we have it all...... Merry Christmas from our family to yours, may your home be filled with love and light during this Holliday season #Christmas2017 #HomeSweetHome #FamilyTime A post shared by  YOLANDA (@yolanda.hadid) on Dec 25, 2017 at 3:02pm PST The new FAO Schwarz is set to open at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in NYC on November 16.
 Lil' Kim was a big influence. Kim Kardashian is known for reinventing herself, especially for magazine photoshoots, but her latest transformation is really something. In the forthcoming issue of CR Fashion Book, Kim trades in her distinctive style, for some '90s-inspired red carpet looks. CR enlisted photographer Petra Collins for the shoot, to capture the iconic Kardashian as she replicated some of the most famous fashion looks from the '90s. And the two most important style icons for the team: Lil' Kim's look from the 1999 MTV Video Music Awards, and Pamela Anderson's '90s red carpet style. Here's Kim channeling Pamela Anderson, wearing a long, platinum blonde wig: And here's her Lil' Kim inspired-look, which she pulls off with aplomb: Kim most definitely suits that pink hair. The 1999-themed, Issue 11 of CR Fashion Book hits newsstands on September 7.

 Day 11 is here‚Äîand it's freeform day!  Continuing the "stay strong" theme of this year's Love Advent calendar, Gigi Hadid sweats it out for Day 11 of the video series.  The model put her own spin on the calendar's workout theme by declaring it "freeform day" at the beginning of her video. Wearing a red Tommy Hilfiger x Gigi Hadid sports bra and leggings (emblazoned with her name, of course), she sports slick wet hair as she hits around a volleyball and practices some boxing moves.  Besides her impressive boxing and volleyball skills (she was actually a competitive volleyball player in high school), Hadid appears to be mostly un-retouched and is flaunting her underarm hair. Considering women's body hair is rarely embraced‚Äîlet alone heralded as sexy‚Äîit's a bold move for both Hadid and the Love Advent series. We're here for it.  "I love seeing everyone else's videos," Hadid says of her inclusion in this year's series. "It's celebratory of epic human beings and always pushes boundaries. The fashion circle is a family, so the Love Advent kind of feels like a Holiday Year Book in a way. Headmaster Grand style." The model joins this year's Love Advent lineup of models including Kendall Jenner, Sara Sampaio, Ashley Graham, Slick Woods, Emily Ratajkowski, Rita Ora, Doutzen Kroes, and more. Still set to appear in the 2017 workout-inspired calendar is Gigi's younger sister Bella. According to a teaser video, her workout of choice is flipping over a giant tire while wearing red lingerie‚Äîa move only slightly less relatable than Gigi's.   
 We break down three vintage street style looks. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. In the latest episode of  This Look is Money, we explore the best of vintage wear by talking to three of fashion‚Äôs latest influencers. Below, Ashley aka Best Dressed, Kelsey Simone, and Sai De Silva breakdown their outfits that you can shop right now.  Who are you wearing? How much did it cost? What favors are you calling in? Think: something old, something new, something borrowed, and something bought resale. Prepare yourself for some major fashion inspiration.   This recent UCLA film grad has a passion for vintage fashion. ‚ÄúSustainability is something that I‚Äôm really passionate about and that I‚Äôm trying to incorporate more into my wardrobe, but I also recognize that it‚Äôs such an elitist issue to ask somebody to pay $200 for a sustainably made Reformation dress,‚Äù Ashley said. ‚ÄúI know buying sustainable can be really expensive, so that is why I love thrift shopping.‚Äù The YouTuber donned a thrifted white slip dress featuring a fitted lace bodice. Over the slip, she also showed off another thrift store gem: a black denim jacket with embroidery on the back. ‚ÄúThe big things that I splurge on are basics and things that need structural integrity,‚Äù Ashley said. ‚ÄúSo, that would be shoes and jeans.‚Äù She stepped out in a pair of Reformation‚Äôs Becca Suede Ankle Boots (at $600, it‚Äôs the most expensive piece in Ashley‚Äôs fit). She finished the look off with layered necklaces by Vanessa Mooney and Melody Eshani and self-designed earrings. A black fanny pack by Brandon Blackwood also made the cut.   Fashion, beauty and lifestyle YouTuber Kelsey Simone has a sense of style that‚Äôs European-inspired and relies on vintage pieces to get the job done. ‚ÄúI probably wear more vintage pieces than I do anything else,‚Äù Simone said. Her vintage Chanel kitten heels would fit right in on the pavements of Paris. She paired the sophisticated shoes with a pair of Chlo√© slacks, featuring a horse decal on the side, which she purchased at a vintage store. For her top, Simone opted for a simple white sweater, which she says is a more relaxed piece compared to her bold pants.  To accessorize, she stacked gold rings from Argento Vivo and wore her trusty J‚ÄôADIOR studs. She also towed along a vintage black handbag.   Blogger Sai De Silva describes her style as a toss between ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù and ‚Äútomboy chic.‚Äù  In this episode, De Silva rocked a vintage white yoke skirt, which she purchased from the Brooklyn Flea Market. The skirt‚Äôs pockets and buttons make it a conveniently chic vintage piece that you can dress up or down. She also sported an old school Brooks Brothers men‚Äôs button down shirt, which was altered to have a frayed hem and a light tie-dye pattern. ‚ÄúYou know what? I thought I was gonna be the only one to like it,‚Äù De Silva said of her funky shirt. ‚ÄúBut, lo and behold, tie-dye is back, baby.‚Äù For shoes, De Silva opted for a clean pair of Supergas. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a mom on the go,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI care about what I look like. I always come back to Supergas because they‚Äôre comfortable and, I mean, they can really jazz up a look.‚Äù The YouTuber accessorized with a white, wallet on chain bag by YSL, chunky golden necklaces, a vintage Rolex watch, and black diamond rings. She also showed off a pair of black shades with gold rimming, which she also purchased secondhand. ‚ÄúGold frames go with everything,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAnd hello? You look chic while you‚Äôre in the sun.‚Äù Watch the rest of the video above to see all the pieces Ashley, Kelsey, and Sai are wearing and add them to your cart.

 The mother-daughter catwalk moment unfolded at Elie Tahari's 45th anniversary show.  Christie Brinkley and Sailor Brinkley Cook brought some mother-daughter modeling to Day 1 of New York Fashion Week.  The supermodel, who just turned 65 this week, returned to the catwalk to close out Elie Tahari's 45th anniversary show. Turning it into a mother-daughter affair, her 20-year-old daughter Sailor walked the same show, giving her mom a high five as the two passed each other on the runway.    For their runway looks, Christie donned an emerald velvet suit, while Sailor wore a navy velvet dress complete with sparkling sleeves and knee-high boots. After the show, the two posed backstage in their matching velvet outfits.     Sailor and me on the same runway ! We‚Äôre on a HIGH...Five‚úãüèºüñêüèºThank you @elietahari  for the honor of walking in your 45th anniversary show!

Thank you Eli for this #majorproudmommoment #major #moment #milestone #nyfw #fashionshow #models #elietahari #45 #elitahari45thanniversary #motherdaughter #runway A post shared by  Christie Brinkley (@christiebrinkley) on Feb 7, 2019 at 2:02pm PST  This marks the first time the mother-daughter duo has walked the runway together, though they have modeled together in the past. In 2017, the two posed alongside Brinkley's eldest daughter, Alexa Ray Joel, in the swimsuit issue of Sports Illustrated. For the shoot, the trio wore coordinating black bathing suits.   Yes!

Now all we need is Cindy Crawford and Kaia Gerber to walk down the runway together next.  
 The actress produced a new film and shot a project for J Brand in the name of ending human trafficking... Kate Bosworth is wearing many different hats‚Äîactress, of course, producer, photographer and activist, with her eyes set on ending human sex trafficking. Bosworth took on a producer role for the upcoming narrative feature film NONA, the tag line of which reads, "A girl from Honduras meets Hecho, who promises to get her safely to America to reunite with her mother. Instead, Nona faces a perilous journey when he doesn't deliver on that promise." Bosworth started down this path after a seemingly simple news story.  "Michael [Polish, Bosworth's husband] and I heard a story on the radio about a sex house busted near our own house. It said there were 44 known sex houses, which of course means there‚Äôs many more than that. We realized that we didn‚Äôt know enough about human and sex trafficking and so we started to do a little bit of research and quickly realized that it‚Äôs a global epidemic," she told BAZAAR.com. "People think it‚Äôs something that doesn‚Äôt affect the U.S., but it‚Äôs a tragic, homegrown problem."  Sex trafficking affects the most vulnerable populations‚Äîchildren fleeing poverty-stricken and dangerous countries, those in the foster care system, homeless youth‚Äî"they‚Äôre taken out of an already difficult situation," Bosworth explains, "and sold into slavery and sex trafficking. Then when they‚Äôre found by the authorities, they‚Äôre considered criminals because they‚Äôre 'prostitutes.' The traffickers are highly intelligent, it‚Äôs not something that couldn‚Äôt happen to you or your daughter or your friend." Nona, written, co-produced and directed by Bosworth's husband Michael Polish, focuses on the story of one young girl to give a face to human trafficking. "Nona is the purest production we‚Äôve put out, the greatest labor of love. We paid for it ourselves. We took an unknown actress from El Salvador, made it entirely in Spanish, in the face of potential violence. The danger that the group [of filmmakers] put themselves in was not going to be insured easily, so we said we just have to do this, we put all our chips in." That unknown actress is Sulem Calderon, who just won an award for her portrayal of Nona at the Richmond Film Festival. Bosworth recently shot Calderon in a series of images for J Brand, a project that came about after a serendipitous meeting. "I had lunch with Mary [Peffer, Senior Director of Brand Creative and Communications] and she was looking for more creative projects, so I asked her to consider me. She trusted my vision." "I suggested that we shoot Sulem. She has a beautiful, international face... she‚Äôs a gorgeous girl, as well as being talented and bright. I wanted a woman shooting a woman." For her first foray behind the lens professionally, Bosworth shot in her own home with her own manual Leica, a craft she has studied with her husband for the past six years. The images also resulted in a collaboration with the denim brand after a tee that Bosworth had her husband write "Love" on looked good enough to sell.  J Brand will be selling a limited run of its Caroline Long Sleeve Tee with custom LOVE stitching on jbrandjeans.com beginning May 2. One hundred percent of the proceeds will be donated to the anti-trafficking charity, CAST.

 I don‚Äôt know who needs to hear this but yes, you can wear white after Labor Day. Trends come and go. Style norms change decade after decade. But fashion's oldest (and most outdated) myth has managed to prevail through countless centuries and cultural shifts‚Äîstill remaining one of the most Googled style questions to this day. With white boots becoming a wardrobe staple and an overload of white winter coat options to choose from, why are we still asking if it's "okay to wear white after Labor Day?"   Though it's unclear who invented this "rule," it originated amongst the elite in 19th century America, explains Amanda Hallay, fashion historian behind The Ultimate Fashion History. "It was a snobbish way for the upper echelons to distinguish themselves from the burgeoning Nouveau Riche."  As most things, the fashion "don't" only continued to flourish into the 20th Century because of the wealthy. "The rule really has more to do with wearing white before Labor Day than not wearing it after," Hallay reveals. "By the end of the 19th Century, upper class Americans escaped the summer heat of the city by retreating to the countryside or seaside, where white clothing remained free of the inevitable grime of the increasingly industrialized urban centers. This was a sartorially social divide‚Äîonly those who could afford to wear white could wear white. Not only did the wealthy summer in the far cleaner countryside, but should their beautiful white dresses get dirty, they had servants to launder them."  The short answer? Absolutely not. In fact, winter white‚Äîfrom shoes to outerwear, knits, and even white pants‚Äìis chicer than ever.    
   At some point along the way, the fashion rule attempted to transition into "no white shoes after Labor Day." But the white boot trend, which has remained a force for several seasons, has since debunked that myth. From cowboy boots to croc-embossed knee high styles and two-toned black and white options, white boots are an unexpectedly fresh way to top off even the bulkiest of winter ensembles.     
 At a time when sneakers are worn with suits and streetwear is more coveted than classic designer items, why are so many people still clinging to such an outdated, strict fashion rule?  "It speaks in part to tradition and a sartorial marking of the seasons, but moreover, Americans are far more class conscious than we like to believe. We've been programmed to believe that white after Labor Day is tacky, and I think it will take a couple more decades for the 'rule' to completely disappear," Hallay says.   In the spirit of breaking fashion rules once and for all, add some white to your fall and winter wardrobe. Leave the rules of the elite in the past where they belong. 
 It's a New Yorker's Parisian dream. S√©zane, the Paris-based online retailer, has teamed up to launch their first ready-to-wear collaboration with NYC based brand Sea on September 5th. The 11-piece collection combines both brand's particular approach to feminine bohemia.  The line‚Äîcomprised of tops, pants dresses, sweatshirts and jumpsuits‚Äîis meant to "extend the summer season," which is exactly what we're all looking for as Instagram after Instagram heralds the demise of the season. S√©zane's founder Morgane Sezalory met with the New York-based design team behind Sea, Monica Paolini and Sean Monahan, in Paris and the rest, as they say, was history.  ‚ÄúI  fell  in  love  with  both  the  designers,  as  well  as  their  designs, from  the  start,  especially  their  use  of  English  embroideries,  beautiful  prints and  feminine  silhouettes.  We  are  all  so  excited  to  share  our  chic  capsule that  combines  the  quintessential  French  style  of  S√©zane  with  the  romantic, feminine  feeling  of  Sea‚Äù  said  S√©zalory, who founded S√©zane in 2013.  The easy, boho-inspired collection features styles each named after parts of New York City. There's a "Chelsea" dress, a "Nolita" jumpsuit, and a "Broadway" pant.  "S√©zane and Sea quickly realized they share a unique vision, both brands seek to offer collections that emphasize easy-to-wear polished pieces with a feminine touch," the brands said in a statement. The pieces keep in a warm family of hues ‚Äî terracotta, ecru and slate ‚Äîand leverage timeless floral prints so nothing feels too trend-driven. These are pieces meant to be collected.  The limited edition capsule is priced under $235, and  will be available online at S√©zane and S√©zane stores beginning September 5.

 The going out top ruled the early 2000s. What's next?  Aside from the days of Studio 54, one could argue that the era of "the going out top" was the Golden Age of nightlife fashion. From tube tops to low-rise jeans and Paris Hilton-inspired nightclub dresses, the late '90s and early 2000s were filled with fashion that made everyone want to go out, order some Cosmos, and flash your flip phone.  But in the age of Netflix binges and choosing to hang with your iPhone instead of actual human beings, what does one wear when they actually decide to "go out?" While we'll always have love for the OG going out top, these 2019 nighttime outfit ideas are inspiring us to choose hitting the bar or club with friends over another Netflix binge on the couch.  There's no better place for the animal print trend than a night out. Try the look in pant form styled with a black bodysuit and strappy sandals.  A straight leg pant with just the right amount of flare to wear from day to night.¬† You'll wear this one-shouldered bodysuit all summer long.¬† Take cue from Bad Gal Riri and go bold by matching a bright eyeshadow to your look. Amp up the matchy, matchy style by going for a shade of lime green.  A cropped sweater that'll give you the Rihanna-approved look when paired with denim cut-offs and a matching neon eyeshadow.¬† This¬†palette of neon eyeshadows will make a statement when paired with¬†your brightest looks.¬† Dress up an LBD or jeans and a tee with crystal rhinestone accessories that feel worthy of a night out‚Äîwhether in the form of a belt, earrings, or shoes.  The ultimate way to top off any night out outfit.¬† Aminda Muaddi's crystal embellished heels make for a night out shoe that's anything but boring.¬† Who cares if you're not going to a black tie gala, wear these anyway.¬† A red dress is an effortless night out look that never fails‚Äîplus it's perfect for those nights when you have "nothing to wear" and need something to throw on.  A long-sleeved little red dress that can be worn with sandals or white sneakers for an unexpected twist.¬† Wear this little Reformation dress from day to night. It'll look just as good with a denim jacket as it does on its own.¬† If you're still down to keep the going out top alive, take note from Bella Hadid and try the look in corset form with a pair of high-waisted trousers.  A corset-style top that looks instantly sexy without fracturing your rib cage.¬† Go bold in this ultra-sexy bodysuit you can still with high-waisted wide-leg pants or a pair of jeans.¬† If you really want to go for it, what better way than taking it back to the days of going out tops, Paris Hilton-inspired looks, and chainmail everything?  A look that feels worthy of Paris Hilton circa 2001.¬† Or try out the chainmail look in dress form with this mini slip style.¬† Really don't feel like going out? Rebel against it all by wearing your satin pajamas as a full-on LEWK.  Wear this glam feather-trimmed pajama set out to drinks, while plotting to overtake your second husband's estate, or to drink¬†wine by yourself at home. Either way, it's a LEWK.¬† But whether your friends are dragging you to a dive bar or you just really want to be comfortable, there are always those nights when you want to go for a super low-key, casual look.  As EmRata proves, a high-waisted pair of jeans and a white crop top are an easy (and effortless) way to look cool without trying.  A budget-friendly white tank for when you want to look like you're not trying too hard.¬† The perfect pair of high-rise mom jeans. Enough said.¬†

 Expect to see the duo's work on the runways of Paris Fashion Week. Balmain is often one step ahead of the rest of its luxury couture minded ilk. Now, the Parisian fashion house has announced how it intends to remain at the forefront of sartorial direction‚Äìand it involves aboveground diamonds. The brand has partnered with Diamond Foundry, the world's only certified carbon-neutral diamond producer. The fruits of this duo is the first Balmain x Diamond Foundry creation: diamond line drop earrings set against circular, silver outlines, and inset with a deep blue rim. These regal earrings will make their debut on the runways of Balmain's Paris Fashion Week Show, which will take place tomorrow at the Garnier Opera House. The collaboration comes at a poignant point in fashion, one in which "sustainability" and "carbon footprints" have bled into the mainstream vernacular of both designers and consumers. Diamonds, in particular, have an outsized environmental and social impact. Diamond mining has often led to exploitative labor practices, soil erosion, and deforestation.  No two Diamond Foundry created diamonds are alike. Each masterfully cut diamond is unique to its core and certified with an individual gemological ID. Learn more about our diamonds via our link in bio. #DiamondFoundry A post shared by  Diamond Foundry (@diamondfoundry) on Sep 21, 2019 at 10:35am PDT Diamond Foundry set out to forge a different path for the diamond industry, introducing a method that uses solar technology to recreate the way in which diamonds form in nature, significantly reducing the environmental hazards associated with traditional mining. ‚ÄúWe are also determined to seek out collaborators who share our core values," said Balmain CEO Massimo Piombini in a statement. "Knowing that Diamond Foundry can supply exceptional quality, while avoiding any negative environmental or social implications, made it very easy for us to make this decision.‚Äù Martin Roscheisen, the CEO of Diamond Foundry, said, ‚ÄúThis collaboration is the perfect marriage of two disruptive brands. It is a testament to the changing needs of the luxury consumers of today toward sustainable alternatives. With innovation at the core of Diamond Foundry, we are happy to witness designers gravitating toward our diamonds with impeccable origins.‚Äù
 Three BAZAAR editors on the pieces they're buying. A good accessory can completely change your look. Think: heels over sneakers, a clutch versus a tote bag. This season, accessories stormed the runways (and then the streets) in various shades of blue, and the color instantly became one of spring's biggest trends. Whether the exact hue is cerulean, royal navy, or something in-between, blue can be both a neutral and a major statement. Plus, it works with just about every other color out there. Here, three BAZAAR editors share their favorite of-the-moment blue accessories and the looks to pair them with. Kerry Pieri, Digital Fashion/Features Director Pieri is known for her polished yet edgy style (think denim with a sparkly diamonte belt), and isn't afraid to add a pop of color to an otherwise simple look. "I love dressing in neutrals, which makes adding a subtle hit of color like this blue bag feel impactful." Chrissy Rutherford, Senior Digital Fashion Editor As a BAZAAR editor and bonafide Instagram star, Rutherford knows what makes a gram-worthy look‚Äîand often dresses from the shoes up. "For spring, I like to swap my go-to black heels for vibrant blue for a fresh perspective. These slingbacks are perfect for the office with a day dress or on the weekends with jeans and easy blouse." Jenna Rosenstein, Senior Beauty Editor Rosenstein is never afraid to experiment, and that's especially true when it comes to hair accessories. "Headbands are having a moment, but don‚Äôt get fixated on the classic black velvet. A blue headband, done in velvet, silk, or even denim, will pop on all hair colors." 

 Meet SPRWMN founder Ambre Dahan, the Cali-French girl behind the brand... Picture the ideal blend of Parisian cool and Los Angeles boheme, and designer Ambre Dahan quickly comes into focus‚Äîwith her sun-streaked, seemingly-straight-from-the-beach hair and an undone approach to style. Dahan is an LA-local by way of France, and a mother of two with a background in denim design. She formerly headed up the team at Joe's Jeans with her ex-husband and current business partner, Joe Dahan. But her current focus is less denim, more leather.  Dahan launched SPRWMN this year with a focus on leather leggings, and it has grown quickly in a niche space. BAZAAR.com spoke with the multi-hyphenate about where fashion is now, Old C√©line, and being the boss.  Tell me about your background in fashion in five sentences or less. I developed my creative sense over the last 15 years through different avenues. I previously worked in denim for 10 years and currently have a fine jewelry brand called Ambre Victoria. I just love making things, there is never an end to creativity. Now I know what I like, and my taste is evolving continuously.  You‚Äôve been involved with other fashion brands in the past, what did you learn from that when it came to launching SPRWMN? With SPRWMN, impeccable product that speaks for itself was the focus. I wanted to create a piece that would be timeless, luxurious, and speak to everyone. You launched this with your ex husband, what is that like? My ex-husband actually came on board over a year after I started SPRWMN.  As the company was quickly growing I really needed a hand and his industry experience. We both have strong opinions, so there is a lot of back and forth between us. I‚Äôm sure it is always fun for everyone in the office to watch us bicker! In the end I usually win‚Äîhe always says that I am the boss! How would you describe the look of SPRWMN? SPRWMN is a leather collection with a casual and athletic feel. Our line is great for every day, and can be easily dressed up. SPRWMN products work flawlessly with my lifestyle in Los Angeles. You can pair our leather leggings with slides, sneakers, or boots. What void did you see in the market that made you want to launch the brand? I come from the denim industry, so I was looking for something that could be a comfortable and chic alternative to all of the jeans in my wardrobe. What do you consider the hero products. All of our leggings have an amazing elastic waistband that is both flattering and comfortable for the wearer. One of my personal favorite pieces is the Crop Flare Pants. They have a great little kick on the leg! How would you describe your style and how does the brand reflect that? I like wearing pieces that are unexpected; I like to take risks with my style. It‚Äôs fun to play around with proportion-mixing pieces that are tight or oversized together. I love anything with bold colors, and a little bit of bling. I don‚Äôt like boring. What are some of your personal favorite brands? Old C√©line, I am going to save a lot of money...Balenciaga, Chanel, and Hermes for bags. And Raquel Allegra. Who do you see wearing the brand (SPRWMN)?  It‚Äôs been really fun to watch SPRWMN grow and to see it on more and more women. The luxurious, high quality French leather is a perfect fit for everyone. Who would be your dream woman to see in SPRWMN? While on a trip to Tahiti, I was on a boat right next to professional surf boarder Bethany Hamilton. Her overall demeanor was so cool! I watched as she was effortlessly taking care of her young son,  a relaxed smile on her face. Bethany looked after her family with ease, all while getting ready to surf the craziest waves I‚Äôd ever seen. She definitely is a SPRWMN. All images by Marie Noorbergen.

 The sister brand will reportedly be called "White Label." Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez, the design duo behind Proenza Schouler, are launching a new line this fall.  According to WWD, the brand is called "White Label" and will offer more casual, accessible pieces like denim, t-shirts and basic essentials. White Label reportedly won't act as a diffusion line to Proenza but rather as a "sister collection." While the price point is still unclear, chances are the wardrobe essentials will be offered at a more affordable price, for those who can't afford Proenza Schouler pieces ranging in the thousands.  News of the secondary line comes as the brand celebrates its 15th anniversary this year. After moving their New York Fashion Week show to Paris to align with the Paris Couture Week schedule, the launch of "White Label" is just the latest in new ventures for the New York-based brand.

 The brand's Cruise 2019 show is coming to the U.S. As more and more brands depart from New York Fashion Week, Prada is instead bringing its next runway show to NYC.   According to WWD, the Italian fashion house will present its Cruise 2019 show in New York on May 4, 2018. The brand is reportedly keeping the exact location of the show under wraps, and has yet to publicly confirm the news.  When it comes to cruise collections, brands typically tap into the jet, set, go mentality and stage runway shows in special, on-location destinations. This May, Louis Vuitton is showing its Cruise 2019 show in the French Riviera while Gucci will present its collection in Arles, France. Chanel and Dior, who typically jet off to luxe, far-away locations, have yet to announce the locations of their Cruise 2019 shows.  Last season, Prada presented its first show during resort season at the Fondazione Prada Osservatorio in Milan, marking the first time the space hosted a runway show.  This year, it looks like the brand is getting in on the destination runway action by bringing its collection to New York. Now the big question is: where in the city will Prada stage its Cruise 2019 show?
 Take denim inspo from the women who wear them best.  When it comes to being comfortable, no jean has your back quite like the boyfriend jean. Loose, cuffed, and infused with the perfect touch of masculinity‚Äîthe look works whether you want to keep things ultra-laidback or all dressed up. Though it may appear effortless, the borrowed from the boys look can be challenging to style, so take note from the fashion set who does it best.  Rihanna puts a feminine twist on her baggy, oversized jeans with a ruffle-sleeved button-down and pointed pumps.  Add an unexpected touch of bohemian flair to ripped and cuffed boyfriend jeans with a printed, billowy crop top, as demonstrated by Hailey Baldwin. Elevate a pair of non-ripped boyfriend jeans for nighttime with a dressed-up blouse (like Zoe Kravitz's velvet v-neck) and classic black pumps.  Current/Elliott jeans, $225, net-a-porter.com.

 The pairs that make the cut, and the ladies who wear them well...  For many moons, the term "mom jeans" was met with side eye at best, and utter disdain at worst. Somewhere between Brooklyn girls rocking vintage Levi's, Re/Done reworking the classics, and other denim houses modernizing the silhouette, something great happened to low-stretch, high-waisted, slim leg denim. In honor of the mom jean rising like a phoenix from the ashes, let's see who wears it well and shop the look.  Debora Rosa proves that the greatest impact these jeans have lies in their inherent ease. Pair them with a button-down and you have that whole minimal blogger thing down. Pixie Market jeans, $85, SHOP NOW The ideal counterpart to your very best¬†mom jeans. Is there anything more apropos than an actual chic Mom rocking Mom jeans like a pro? The go-to hue for a solid mom jean is definitely a distressed light blue denim that call to mind Cindy Crawford in the '90s.¬† This blogger is proof that investing in the basics, well done, is the basis of a great wardrobe.  We love a faded black pair of mom jeans, pair with a white blouse or white tee and single sole pump for an elegant, laid-back look.¬† A white mom jean is the most modern iteration on this denim fit. We've all withstood the perils of too-tight white denim. This low-stretch, roomier approach is just what the perfect winter white look ordered.  We see you perfect white jeans, and we want to get to know you better‚Äîideally with a cream cable-knit sweater and tan suede cowboy boots. And in case you missed it, the moral of this story is that you'd be hard pressed to find jeans that make your butt look better than a good, old fashioned Mom jean. Levi's jeans, $98, shopbop.com.

 The model made several outfit changes during her third VS Fashion Show.   This year marks Bella Hadid's third time gracing the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show runway, and unsurprisingly, she once again killed it.  During tonight's taping of the lingerie extravaganza in New York, attendees shared a sneak-peek at the model's walk on Instagram and Twitter, revealing some of her looks in this year's show. In one of her outfits, Bella hits the catwalk in a sporty lingerie set complete with an ultra-cropped varsity jacket and sock booties. In the short clip, she can be seen showing off her walk and blowing a kiss at the end of the runway as Rita Ora sings "Let You Love Me."  In another video posted to Twitter, Bella struts in a second look, this time with a set of VS's signature wings. As she follows Devon Windsor down the runway, Hadid sports a seafoam green lingerie set topped off with matching feathered wings (coincidentally the same look I'm wearing tonight as well).  Devon Windsor & Bella Hadid on the runway! #VSFashionShow #vsfs18 pic.twitter.com/AKLXka6V6Y As of press time, these are the only two videos that have emerged of Bella on the Victoria's Secret runway tonight. It's possible, however, that the model donned additional looks throughout the evening. Although the show is taking place in New York tonight, it won't air on television until Sunday, December 2 on ABC at 10 p.m. EST. Until then, we'll be obsessively refreshing the brand's Instagram feed for more sneak peeks at all the models' looks this year.  Plus, you can peruse more backstage photos from the 2018 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show below.

 You'll see it on the runways at Milan Fashion Week. Gigi Hadid and Tommy Hilfiger's collaboration streak continues with a collection full of racing influences. The Spring 2018 range, their fourth one together, includes track-inspired designs, like the black and white check, color-blocked leather jackets, and, of course, fingerless driving gloves.  The model and designer aren't the first to be inspired by speed; other brands like Rihanna's Fenty x Puma, Dior, and Ralph Lauren incorporated similar athletic elements in their Spring 2018 collections, which hit the runway last fall. Hadid and Hilfiger's renditions, however, stay true to the brand's red, white, and blue color palette. It will also launch on February 25, the same day the clothes hit the runway at Milan Fashion Week.  Before dabbling in driver-friendly fashion, Tommy x Gigi's previously channeled nautical inspirations, western influences, and rock 'n' roll aesthetics in earlier collections. This will mark  Tommy x Gigi's first time showing in Italy, following previous presentations in New York, Los Angeles, and London. At this point, the star-studded runway shows have evolved into full-blown runway extravaganzas. Last season's "Rock Circus" was set in a stadium-like venue in London and featured aerial dancers and acrobats. The Chainsmokers also performed. "It‚Äôs about the fusion of fashion, entertainment and pop culture with experiences, performances and inspiring interactions that are designed around our consumers. As one of the fashion capitals of the world, Milan is the perfect place to celebrate our next TOMMYNOW show," Hilfiger said in a statement about his next venue. We're sure the upcoming presentation will be even more epic than the first three. The countdown to February 25 starts now. Flip through the lookbook, and shop through previous collections here.

 The supermodel just made an incredible return to New York.  Good morning, Happy Monday, and God Bless America because Kate Moss is finally back in the States.  For the first time in nine years (more on that later), the supermodel returned to New York wearing a 'Make America Kate Again' moto jacket, which is a political statement we can absolutely get behind.    The hand-painted leather jacket is by Alyson Eastman, a rising New York-based designer who just launched her brand in 2016. Making for the most iconic of returns, Kate the Great posed in the tongue-in-cheek design on Instagram to celebrate her comeback. Best of all, the jacket will soon be available to shop on alysoneastman.com.   But unlike her jacket, Kate's absence from the United States wasn't exactly due to throwing shade at Donald Trump. In fact, the British supermodel hasn't been in the United States for almost a decade. If you, like us, are wondering why we've been deprived of Moss's presence, it's reportedly due to the fact that she encountered some issues obtaining a U.S. visa.  Back in February, the Daily Mail spotted Kate leaving the US embassy in London with a passport and a stack of visa application forms‚Äîindicating her return has been in the works for a few months. The last time Moss was in New York was for the 2009 Met Gala, which she co-hosted alongside Marc Jacobs. The designer took to Instagram to announce that the supermodel would be attending tonight's Met Gala with him once again. "She‚Äôs back! In 2009 me, Kate @katemossagency, and Justin Timberlake cohosted the Met Ball. Looking forward to seeing Kate back in NYC tonite ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è" the designer wrote.  Just when we thought this year's Met Gala couldn't get anymore exciting...
 The brand has a first-hand experience with a mass shooting.  On February 14, a mass shooting left 17 dead at Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Since then, the school's teenage survivors have been tirelessly speaking out, organizing, and mobilizing for better gun control in America. As a result, March For Our Lives, a gun-control protest set to take place in Washington, D.C. on March 24, has been planned by a group of Parkland teenagers. Now, the movement is receiving support from an unexpected source: Gucci.  The Italian fashion brand announced it would be making a $500,000 donation to March For Our Lives and is also sending its own team to walk in the march.  Creative director Alessandro Michele also spoke out about the teenagers of Parkland, Florida, adding, "I am truly moved by the courage of these students. My love is with them and it will be next to them on March 24. I am standing with March for Our Lives and the strong young women and men across the United States who are fighting for their generation and those to come." According to BoF, Gucci has first-hand experience dealing with mass shootings in the U.S. In June 2016, a Gucci employee was amongst 49 victims killed in a shooting at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida. Another employee was injured in the same shooting.  The brand has previously made its own political statements, most recently in its Pre-Fall 2018 campaign that channeled the movement of student protests during the 1960s.    While many other companies have gotten involved in the fight for gun-control by cutting ties with the NRA, Gucci is the first fashion brand to publicly donate to the cause. 
 Up the ante on your fitness routine. While New Years resolutions are in full effect for the month of January, we could all use some new activewear, right? Enter, Adam Selman's new activewear line, known as Adam Selman Sport, that launched last week and it's as fun and sexy as you'd expect it to be.  It was just 2014 when Selman made his New York Fashion Week debut, and has since come to be known as the label for the coolest girls. Rihanna, Alexa Chung, Katy Perry and Gigi Hadid are all fans of his feminine and flirty designs. His sunglasses collaboration with Le Specs continues to go viral and sell out with every drop.  Selman spent much of his career dressing one of the biggest pop stars in the world, as Rihanna's costume designer Selman he helped define her as the bad gal we all know and love. Also, how could we forget that iconic Swarovski-embellished naked dress he created for Rihanna when she was being honored with the CFDA Style Icon Award.  Now, the designer is changing up the game, the workout game that is. His activewear blends fashion and performance, and follows his signature style: a little sparkle, a little neon, and a lot of animal prints. For those who love Selman for his bold ready-to-wear can also bring that look straight into the gym or their next pilates class. This week you can shop the collection on Net-a-Porter.com, as well as on the Carbon38.com, which is also offering extended sizing and unisex styles.

 "I get more nervous every season, not less nervous, because the brand keeps getting bigger." Victoria Beckham celebrated ten years of her label with her first show at London Fashion Week on Sunday.  Taking place in London's Mayfair at Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac, which is close to Victoria Beckham's flagship store, the intimate show was attended by all of Beckham's children‚ÄîBrooklyn, Romeo, Cruz, and Harper‚Äîas well as her husband, David Beckham.  The show took place in front of 250 guests, per The Guardian, who cited Beckham as revealing before the show, "I get more nervous every season, not less nervous, because the brand keeps getting bigger." The publication also said that the show "oozed confidence," making it a suitable celebration to mark ten years of the former singer's eponymous brand. Beckham arrived at the venue wearing one of the show's looks, including an oversized jacket and turquoise slitted pants:   Husband David arrived holding hands with daughter Harper, and the whole family celebrated the show on Instagram:   Amazing show mum love you so much @victoriabeckham ‚ù§Ô∏è A post shared by  ROMEO (@romeobeckham) on Sep 16, 2018 at 2:36am PDT  Just having lunch with family then excited to meet u all at my store at 3pm today!! X kisses x A post shared by  Victoria Beckham (@victoriabeckham) on Sep 16, 2018 at 5:41am PDT  The BBC described the dramatic show opening in which model Stella Maxwell descended a marble staircase in the venue, followed by the rest of Beckham's models: The collection itself featured oversized bags, loose-fitting jackets, and over-long pants. Most of the models wore matching metallic boots or flats, as they walked the gallery's unusual runway, which was round: An exception to the metallic footwear was featured in the form of a fabric mule, made to look like chainmail:  Nylon sports-inspired drawstring bags were shown alongside oversized leather satchels and clutches: And after the show, Beckham was understandably emotional to be marking such an important anniversary for her brand at London Fashion Week:  
 Our fashion director picks the key looks to know now. After a month of fashion shows from New York to Paris, we've seen a lot of fashion‚Äîand we mean a lot. Below, our fashion director breaks down the 12 looks that stood out from the rest.
 ‚ÄúWhat is time?‚Äù is officially the new ‚Äúwhat is camp?‚Äù This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. This year's camp-themed Met Gala delivered an endless stream of over-the-top red carpet moments (and several live outfit changes from Lady Gaga), but it's officially time to look ahead to the 2020 event. The Metropolitan Museum of Art announced the theme of next year's Costume Institute exhibit will be "About Time: Fashion and Duration.‚Äù  If you thought camp was confusing, you probably have some questions about what exactly a "time" theme means. Inspired by Virginia Woolf and 20th-century French philosopher Henri Bergson, the exhibit will look back at the timeline of women's fashion from the last 150 years (dating from 1870 to today) to coincide with the Met's 150th anniversary. Woolf will serve as the "ghost narrator" of the exhibit.  For a more specific image, Sally Porter's 1992 film Orlando, based on Virginia Woolf's time-traveling novel of the same name, served as the main inspiration for the 2020 theme. Starring Tilda Swinton, the movie's fashion spanned from 18th-century Marie Antoinette-inspired style to 19th century dressing. In other words, prepare to see some grandiose, "let them eat cake"-worthy looks on next year's Met Gala red carpet.  ‚ÄúFashion is indelibly connected to time, it not only reflects and represents the spirit of the times, but it also changes and develops with the times," Andrew Bolton, the curator of the Costume Institute, told the New York Times.  Given the range of a 150-year timeline of fashion, it may be one of the most abstract and eclectic Met Gala red carpets ever‚Äîwith celebrities being able to time-travel back through several centuries of fashion. Or, of course, they technically could opt for something that's "timeless." The co-chairs of the 2020 Met Gala are Meryl Streep, Emma Stone, Lin-Manuel Miranda, and Nicolas Ghesquiere of Louis Vuitton (the brand will serve as a sponsor for the event). Most excitingly, it will mark the first ever Met Gala attendance for Streep.  The 2020 Met Gala will be held on May 4 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the exhibition will open to the public on May 7, 2020. 
 The new creative director introduced a new look for the fashion house.   Making his first major move as creative director at Burberry, Riccardo Tisci has unveiled a new logo and monogram for the British heritage brand. The redesign comes ahead of Tisci's first runway show for Burberry this September during London Fashion Week.  The new logo features a sleek and streamlined bold sans-serif text in all caps. Its new monogram, however, is an an interlocking 'TB' pattern‚Äîafter the house's founder, Thomas Burberry‚Äîdone in a red, honey-beige, and white color scheme. Both were designed in collaboration with Peter Saville, the graphic designer who also redesigned  Calvin Klein's new logo under Raf Simons last year.    According to the brand's Instagram Stories, the new designs were inspired by a 1908 monogram for Thomas Burberry that Tisci discovered while on a visit to the Burberry archives. The brand also posted an email exchange between Tisci and Saville revealing that the entire design process took place in just four weeks. As the Business of Fashion reports, this marks the first new logo design for Burberry in nearly two decades. The last logo revamp took place in 1999 when the brand dropped the ‚Äú‚Äôs‚Äù from ‚ÄúBurberry‚Äôs.‚Äù  The redesign will roll out in Burberry stores in the coming months‚Äîno word on what that means for the future of the classic Burberry check pattern. 
 Amal Clooney's wedding dress is one of the looks on display. The Glamour and Romance of Oscar de la Renta has opened at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, celebrating the late designer's iconic style and most stunning works. The exhibit features 70 looks from the OLDR archives, dating from the '60s to 2014,  the museum's own collection, Pierre Balmain's archives (de la Renta helmed the house from 1993 to 2002), and loaned pieces from the brand's biggest clients, WWD reports. (Amal Clooney's lace wedding dress is in the mix, for example.) The presentation is the perfect way to remember the iconic designer, who passed away in 2014 at the age of 82. The pieces on display aren't limited to clothing, however, The exhibit also includes design sketches from de la Renta, editorials featuring his work, and photographs of the designer himself.

 According to how successful it is at convincing you to buy  Louis Vuitton is once again the world's most valuable fashion brand, based on its financial performance and ability to both influence customer choice and command premium prices. The luxury label featured in 19th position on Interbrand's Best Global Brands 2017 list, the highest ranking for any fashion company. It was preceded by tech brands‚ÄîApple, Google and Microsoft held the top three positions. Vuitton was followed by Herm√®s at 32 and then Gucci at 51. According to the Business of Fashion, Burberry dropped three places to 88, while Prada fell 13 places to 94. Dior came in at 95, while Ralph Lauren just missed out on a place in the top 100, having been ranked 98th last year. "Louis Vuitton has connected the brand into culture," said Rebecca Robins, global director at Interbrand and co-author of "Meta-Luxury".  "When we look at Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Herm√®s what is the magic with these brands? Not only are they going strong operationally, but it's their relationship between brand and culture and they are doing it in a way that is of the moment and relevant but also sustainable," added Robins citing its recent Supreme collaboration. "It's not a flash-in-the-pan. It's well thought through, strategically driven and delivered with the strength of their conviction." Vuitton manages to appeal to rising cool starlets, as well as more established names. Sophie Turner, Sasha Lane, Zendaya, Alicia Vikander and Ruth Negga are all fans, and it was one of the first brands to harness the promotional powers of the cast of Stranger Things. However, it's also supported by Hollywood veterans such as Michelle Williams, Catherine Deneuve and Jennifer Aniston. French First Lady Brigitte Macron is also seen regularly wearing Vuitton.

 Some are threatening to boycott the brand. Well, this is awkward. Adidas is currently facing a whole heap of backlash on Instagram and Twitter after unveiling Kendall Jenner's newest ad for the sportswear brand. While this is no Pepsi fiasco, people are calling out Adidias Originals for using a model, rather than an athlete, as the face of its brand. Of course, this is nothing new - hello Gigi Hadid for Reebok and Kylie Jenner for Puma - but it seems that there is something about these particular ads that have really ground people's gears. Adidas first posted a short clip of the ad to Instagram last week, which shows Kendall lying in a perspex box saying "I did what I had to do. I faced it all, and I stood tall. I did it my way." And later, Kendall shared another clip from the campaign: And that's when the criticism started rolling in. Some just found the whole 'Originals' concept a little, well, lost... But not everyone found the ad offensive. Fans leapt to Kendall's defence to compliment her on the new ad, with some explaining that Adidas Originals has never been a brand just for athletes.

 "I want everyone to feel included with this collaboration," Kardashian says of her partnership. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. Kim Kardashian has teamed up with eyewear brand Carolina Lemke to release a collection of seven sunglasses that cost $90 a piece, and are available to shop right now. She is also set to release a second collection featuring six different styles in late Spring.   ‚ÄúThere is something for everyone. I want everyone to feel included with this collaboration," Kardashian said in a statement about the first release of her collaboration. "We‚Äôve included everything from a big statement shield to a really simple, classic shape." There are also some very Bella Hadid tiny shades. Kardashian added that she was involved in the developmental process with the brand's team and that she is "so excited to share them with my friends and my family.‚Äù Kardashian not only had input on the creative aspect of designing, but ever the savvy biz woman, she is also a business partner in Carolina Lemke. In recent years, Kardashian has diversified her business portfolio to include KKW Beauty (a range of color cosmetics), KKW Fragrances, Kids Supply (children's clothing line), and an app for mobile devices.  The initial seven-piece drop features various silhouettes including a pair of attention-grabbing shield sunglasses (Nirvana, Sahara, and Rider) and a '90s-inspired frame that reminds us of the Matrix (Dusk). There's also a metal-framed circular pair (Indra), angular Tempest, and a killer pair of sleek metal-rimmed frames (Chaotix).  Dusk is currently available in classic black, and the other six styles are in a variety of colors, ranging from burgundy (Indra), metallic gold (Chaotix), and neon (Sahara, Nirvana, and rider) that would make a stylish addition to your festival season wardrobe. Check out the full collection, modeled by Kardashian and lensed by Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott below.

 The fashion legend and new Decort√© creative director opens up to Bazaar.   Kate Moss is on a roll. The famously guarded supermodel is rhapsodizing about lotions and potions. ‚ÄúSorry for going on,‚Äù she says, finally coming up for air surrounded by a pile of makeup and moisturizers, ‚Äúbut when I get really excited about something I can talk about it for hours.‚Äù The reason for Moss‚Äôs volubility, and her visit to New York, where we meet in the penthouse of a downtown hotel, is her recent signing as the creative director of Decort√©, the cult Japanese beauty brand known for its state-of-the-art serums and whose advertising campaigns she has modeled in for the past three years. ‚ÄúI love the products, I really believe in them,‚Äù she offers, between drags of a Marlboro, ‚Äúso it‚Äôs easy for me to talk about them. I used to bring them back for my friends every time I‚Äôd go to Japan because after the first time they were all like, ‚ÄòPlease, can I have some more.‚Äô‚Äù   Although clearly excited about her new gig and loaded title (‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so grown-up; it basically means I‚Äôm responsible for the look of the ad campaigns as well as starring in them‚Äù), Moss, 44, knows that being the face of the brand invites scrutiny as to how she is aging. ‚ÄúWell, people are going to do that anyway,‚Äù she says, referring to the tabloid obsession with her maturing. (The Daily Mail, for one, keeps a running tab on her looks.) ‚ÄúI‚Äôm used to it by now.‚Äù She recounts how, when she was starting out as a teenager, the photographer Mario Testino used to inspect her face for imperfections after she was done with hair and makeup on their shoots. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôd hold his glasses up to my face like they were a magnifying glass, and I‚Äôd start shaking my head so he couldn‚Äôt focus,‚Äù she recalls, drawing uncomfortably close to my face before filling the room with one of her signature cackles. ‚ÄúLuckily I had a good head on my shoulders, but can you imagine?‚Äù  The supermodel, for the record, looks great. Dressed in a black Prada cashmere sweater and trousers by the Row, her arms adorned with bracelets by Dior and Cartier (not to mention tattoos of an anchor and a cross), Moss is a picture of unstudied glamour. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my lounging outfit,‚Äù she jokes. Before I can ask about the rings on her left hand, she chimes in, ‚ÄúDiamonds, darling. Vintage diamonds.‚Äù Her hair is Bardot-blonde and perfectly tousled in a way that suggests she woke up like that. Sure, her face (tanned from a recent Greek vacation with her boyfriend, the photographer Count Nikolai von Bismarck) betrays a few incipient lines around her eyes and mouth, but she remains every bit the iconic beauty who has appeared on countless magazine covers and inspired artists and photographers from Lucian Freud to Mario Sorrenti (in fact, the latter just came out with a coffee-table book called Kate that‚Äôs filled with intimate, never-before-published portraits of Moss when she was on the cusp of stardom).   Friends say that Moss‚Äôs humble nature has played a key role in her unusually long reign at the top. ‚ÄúWe can all see something of ourselves in Kate,‚Äù says former model and band manager Tricia Ronane, a longtime friend of Moss‚Äôs. ‚ÄúWomen see her living a normal life, having a job and being a mom, going out with friends and having a boyfriend. We see her doing these things and looking great while not appearing to spend too much time worrying about it. It is an approachable lifestyle that we can all see ourselves living.‚Äù James Brown, a London-based stylist who grew up in the same working-class suburb of Croydon as Moss and who worked on the new Decort√© campaign, agrees. ‚ÄúShe always looks effortless, and maybe because nothing is ever too scary on her, it looks achievable. People relate to her. We‚Äôll be in a deli grabbing a sandwich, and someone will just go up to her and ask her what she is ordering.‚Äù "I think it helps that I don‚Äôt take myself too seriously."  It‚Äôs a relatability that Decort√© and Moss are gambling will pay off at the beauty counter. ‚ÄúI think it helps that I don‚Äôt take myself too seriously,‚Äù Moss muses on the sway she has on women around the world. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to be a slave to beauty. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love beauty products more than ever‚Äîas you get older, you have more to hide‚Äîbut I‚Äôm not obsessed. Even when I‚Äôm going out, I still find it hard to wear false eyelashes and stuff. Sometimes [makeup artist] Pat McGrath will be like, ‚ÄòCome on, darling, let‚Äôs put a lash on you,‚Äô but I would never put one on myself.‚Äù Moss, who learned about beauty on set from the world‚Äôs leading hair and makeup artists, is good at it, says Brown. ‚ÄúThe second you touch her with a tool or a product, she just knows and will be like, ‚ÄòThe fifth curl on the right behind my ear doesn‚Äôt feel right,‚Äô and she is always spot-on.‚Äù These days, Moss is being schooled by Lila, her 16-year-old daughter with Dazed Media cofounder Jefferson Hack. ‚ÄúShe teaches me everything,‚Äù says Moss. ‚ÄúLila and her friends follow all the beauty blogs and Instagram accounts, and she‚Äôll be like, ‚ÄòMum, you have to try this, it‚Äôs amazing what they can do now.‚Äô She does all that contouring and stuff, which I‚Äôm sure they do to me when I‚Äôm at work, but I never pay any attention. I‚Äôm too busy talking.‚Äù   The only advice she has for Lila‚Äîwho was recently named the newest face of Marc Jacobs Beauty‚Äîis to appreciate her individuality. To this day, Moss says she finds it hard to believe that she managed to make a name for herself in the age of Naomi, Linda, and Christy. ‚ÄúI never could compare myself to those girls,‚Äù she explains. ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt five foot eleven, I wasn‚Äôt built like they were. I was always different, and that‚Äôs why I got booked. For Lila and her friends, it‚Äôs hard because it‚Äôs all there on the phone, the Kardashian factor, it‚Äôs in their face much more than it was for us. It‚Äôs instant inspiration but also instant judgment. But she has seen me, and I‚Äôm not obsessed with myself, so hopefully that will rub off.‚Äù Lila would do well to also learn from her mom‚Äôs work ethic. ‚ÄúKate has an incredible personal style and great taste,‚Äù says the photographer S√∏lve Sundsb√∏. ‚ÄúBut in the same way that Bowie was more than his music, she represents much more than just being a supermodel.‚Äù In addition to remaining one of the world‚Äôs most in-demand models, Moss is a contributing editor for British Vogue; has designed capsule collections for Topshop and Longchamp; collaborated on wallpaper with de Gournay; and after 28 years of being represented by Storm Models, launched the Kate Moss Agency two years ago. Her roster consists almost exclusively of models with interesting side hustles, such as DJ Luka Isaac, Game of Thrones actress Gwendoline Christie, and singer Rita Ora. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an eclectic mix,‚Äù says Moss, ‚Äúbut as a gang, everyone kind of works together.‚Äù "If I only had one product, it would be an intensive moisturizer. ¬†The¬†Meliority cream is rich but it‚Äôs not¬†heavy. I call it my 'transformation in a jar.'" "It gives lips more of a sheen than a color." "I‚Äôve been using this Liposome serum for years now and it‚Äôs an essential part of my daily routine. The liposome technology hydrates my skin and I love the feel of this." "When I need that extra little bit of comfort, I use the Vitality Tincture.¬†Honestly I feel five years younger when I use it." "I use this for proper coverage under my chin‚Äîit always gets a bit red‚Äîand around my nose." "This has 30SPF and it‚Äôs very light. I like to use some coverage because obviously as you get older you have a bit more to hide. But I don‚Äôt like heavy foundation because I don‚Äôt like that feeling of wearing a mask. This one sits nicely on your skin." Though she claims to have become a mother hen who gets depressed when her charges don‚Äôt land a job, Moss says she works hard to keep stress in check. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve learned to take care of myself a bit more,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI do yoga every day. I don‚Äôt go out nearly as much. And I take care of my skin, which somehow has held up. The bad things I have done usually take their toll, and I‚Äôve been quite lucky in that respect, but you have to put in the work.‚Äù Spoken like a true beauty impresario.

 Mod accents and pastel hues look right at home ‚Äî even in an urban jungle. The stylish little SoCal city of Palm Springs is known for desert heat, palm trees, and lots of dreamy colors. In fact, the iconic destination's unofficial uniform involves popsicle hues, oversized sunglasses, and the dreamy mod silhouettes of the '60s. With spring unofficially here, it's the perfect time for the desert oasis's rusty reds and poppy yellows to inspire a whole look‚Äîeven if you're living in a cityscape on the other side of the country. Here, BAZAAR's beauty editor Jenna Rosenstein gives Palm Springs style an urban update with five summer-ready looks. Bright hues don‚Äôt need to empower an entire outfit.

 What do you mean you don't wear lingerie on a casual bodega run? Emily Ratajakowski isn't afraid to wear her lingerie out while running errands at a local bodega in Brooklyn, NY and she doesn't want you to be shy about embracing your body and femininity either.   "I think the Inamorata woman is the woman who will wear a bra top out to walk her dog and not even think about it. She is confident and doesn‚Äôt care what anyone thinks," EmRata said on the website for her brand, Inamorata.  Back in 2017 when Emily was just 25 years old, she co-launched Inamorata Swim, a six-piece bathing suit line that was inspired by her childhood in San Diego, California. Yesterday, the top model debuted the launch of the new chapter of Inamorata: BODY, a mix of lingerie staples and bodywear where each garment is named after popular streets in downtown Manhattan and Brooklyn. "A little over a year of @inamoratawoman and I'm so thrilled to finally share what I've been working on for you guys," she captioned her first Instagram from the brand's debut intimates lookbook. "Introducing BODY, a category that is so much more than lingerie. I hope you guys love it as much as I do."  EmRata also shared her top three personal favorite pieces from the product launch on IG, which includes the Bleecker: a sheer, charcoal grey, lace bodysuit with scallop trim and criss-cross back, that's named after a popular shopping street that runs from Greenwich Village to the Bowery. Emily also fancies the classic red ribbed-knit wireless bra and matching panty dubbed the Wythe, named for an avenue facing the East River in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Rounding out her top three is a millennial pink, cropped, scoop neck cami with matching bottoms, called the Stanton, an east-west street in the Lower East Side neighborhood of NYC.  The full 47-piece collection is available online and will begin shipping on February 11. Scroll down to see the full collection, plus watch her nighttime beauty routine below.
 50 years of the Anne Klein legacy revisited with an exclusive vintage curation and pop-up exhibit.  Recognized as one of the groundbreaking designers to put American fashion on the map, Anne Klein wasn't just a designer, she was a champion of authentic style and empowered the way women dressed. 50 years later, her legacy continues to influence contemporary elegance and inspire the modern woman.

 The rapper wore head-to-toe animal print to Dolce & Gabbana's show.  Cardi B, self-proclaimed "regular, degular, schmegular girl from the Bronx," touched down at Milan Fashion Week this weekend to attend Dolce & Gabbana's Spring 2019 show. For the occasion, the rapper channeled a fellow New York native‚ÄîThe Nanny's Fran Drescher‚Äîin a head-to-toe animal print look.   Fran Drescher in @dolcegabbana A post shared by  Iamcardib (@iamcardib) on Sep 23, 2018 at 6:49am PDT "Fran Drescher in Dolce & Gabbana," Cardi wrote on Instagram alongside a photo of her entering the show. Wearing more animal print than we thought humanly possible, she donned a tiger print trench, leopard pussy bow blouse, over-the-knee leopard boots, and furry D+G glasses to top off the look.  For reference, she did our favorite nanny from Flushing, Queens justice in the full-on animal print ensemble:   What was even better than Cardi's amazing Dolce & Gabbana look, however, was her commentary to go with it.   MILAN A post shared by  Iamcardib (@iamcardib) on Sep 23, 2018 at 6:36am PDT Behold, a transcription of the greatest Fashion Week critique of all time, by Cardi B:  "Get into these motherf*cking glasses, b*tch! These glasses right here? The fur? They got my face SUPER warm, like if I got a North Face‚Äîwinter certified. Dolce & Gabbana want all my schmoney! Man, these Italians got me f*cked up, giving me champagne in the afternoon, they must not know that I'm light. What's good, b*tch? We out here in Milan, drinking sparkling water, eating some spaghettis (insert evil laughter)....b*tch!!!"  Consider this our official petition to have Cardi review all the Fashion Month shows moving forward.

 Mickey and Minnie just became the hottest runway models of the season.  Skipping New York Fashion Week this season, Opening Ceremony instead staged its Spring 2018 show at the happiest place on Earth: Disneyland.  In honor of Mickey Mouse's 90th birthday, the New York-based brand dedicated its entire spring collection to the most famous faces of Disney, Mickey and Minnie. For the special occasion, Opening Ceremony took over Mickey's Toontown in Disneyland‚Äîmarking the first time in over four decades that the Californian park has hosted a fashion show.  As if watching Mickey and Minnie Mouse walk the runway wasn't exciting enough, guests also had three hours to roam Mickey's Toontown to go on rides, see attractions, and have the greatest time on Earth. At 9:00 PM, the runway show began in the midst of the park.  The collection, which was inspired by the world's most famous mouse, featured a lineup of Mickey-infused looks from faux fur coats to wide-leg pants, cool bomber jackets, and accessories.  Of course, if anyone can make Mickey look cooler than ever, it's Opening Ceremony founders Carol Lim and Humberto Leon. While half of the collection is see-now, buy-now and already available to shop, the other half will drop in October.  The pieces will be available to shop in Disneyland (the first time a brand has done so) and are also available online at openingceremony.com now.  Oh, and did we mention Mickey and Minnie not only walked the runway, but also took the final bow alongside designers Carol and Humberto? Watch out, Kaia Gerber.  Imma let you finish Paris Fashion Week, but Disneyland just had the happiest runway show of all time.  SHOP OPENING CEREMONY X DISNEY
 Guess who 1984 was all about. These are the celebrities, films, TV shows, and pop-culture moments that have inspired Halloween costumes over the past 50 years.  Boo! Thanks to successful books and a cartoon, Casper the Friendly Ghost made many trick-or-treat appearances in 1968.  Elvis Presley's NBC Comeback Special premiered in December 1968, and by next Halloween people were giving their best impressions of The King.  When The Beatles officially split in 1970, many fans wanted to relive the good ol' days one last time.  Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory may have been a film about a little boy with a dream, but it was the Candy Man who stole hearts in 1971.  Halloween in 1972 was all about channeling your inner Don Vito Corleone from The Godfather.  The Brady Bunch is a classic now, but in 1973 it was one of the most popular shows on television.  The first film adaptation of the classic F. Scott Fitzgerald novel was a total throwback to the 1920s.  Before Left Shark was even a thing, Jaws was the shark getting all the attention in 1975. In 1976, Rocky had wannabe boxers heading to the ring to emulate its lead.  If you weren't channeling Star Wars in 1977, what were you even doing? Many people hit the dance floor in 1978 wearing their best look from Saturday Night Fever ‚Äî the film was released at the very end of 1977. Superman made 1979 Halloween celebrators want to become the Man of Steel for a night.  Cute heels and a plaid shirt helped ladies transform into Daisy Duke from Dukes of Hazzard in 1980.  You probably saw many people walking around with a hat and a whip attached to their hip in 1981 in order to become Indiana Jones in Raiders of the Lost Ark. In 1982, it was hard to not fall in love with Annie, the star of the eponymous film, and her infectiously positive attitude.  In 1983, Madonna fans loved the singer's edginess and wanted any excuse to dress up like the Material Girl. Everyone caught the supernatural bug with the release of Ghostbusters in 1984.  In '85, there was nobody cooler than Michael J. Fox in Back to the Future.  For Halloween 1986, pink hair and a microphone was all the rage, thanks to the animated series Jem and the Holograms.  RoboCop was  practically begging to become a Halloween favorite in 1987, and fans didn't disappoint.  Who wouldn't want to experience being a lazy cat like Garfield for a day? In 1989, the first film in the Batman series was released, and fans have been dressing up as the Caped Crusader ever since.  You can't think about the early '90s without thinking of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.  In 1991, your dream of becoming a member of the Addams Family finally could come true. Michelle Pfeiffer brought Catwoman to life in 1992's Batman Returns. Cat ears for the win! Jurassic Park gave fans dinosaur fever in 1993. The Lion King was released in 1994, and you might have been living under a rock if you didn't dress up as Simba or Mufasa.   The success of Star Trek: The Next Generationseries satisfied the space dreamers in 1995.  Scream masks became the mask of all masks.  The release of "Wannabe" in 1997 had everyone saying, "Girl power."

 "I am sorry. I am so sorry. I am so sorry." Donna Karan has asked for forgiveness after her controversial comments made about Harvey Weinstein last week. The famed fashion designer questioned whether women "are asking for it" when it comes to sexual assault and harassment. She was accused of victim-blaming and many said that they would boycott her brand after she made the following on-camera comment at the CineFashion Film Awards in LA: "How do we display ourselves, how do we present ourselves as women, what are we asking? Are we asking for it, you know, by presenting all the sensuality and all the sexuality?‚Ä¶It‚Äôs not Harvey Weinstein. You look at everything all over the world today, you know, and how women are dressing and, you know, what they‚Äôre asking by just presenting themselves the way they do. What are they asking for? Trouble." Now, in a hugely apologetic, remorseful interview with WWD, she has pleaded with the public to absolve her. "I am sorry. I am so sorry. I am so sorry. Please forgive me," she said. "This is not the woman that I am and that you know, and I think most women know that about me. And for those of you who don‚Äôt, I will try to show over the next years or decades who Donna Karan is." Her quotes shocked the industry and beyond‚ÄîKaran is known for empowering women and for her sensual campaigns. She put her comments down to fatigue and fear. "I heard a little bit of rumor. It was not like I had heard the entire story," she said. "It was like a complete rumor that I had heard and I didn‚Äôt want to comment on it. So I kind of weaved my way around it. I know Georgina [Chapman, Weinstein‚Äôs wife and principal designer of the Marchesa brand], I know Harvey, and I didn‚Äôt think it was appropriate for me to be commenting on it, so I wiggled my way out of it. However, what I did comment on was sexual harassment." The designer acknowledges she shouldn't have said what she did, calling the quotes "inappropriate" and "stupid." The designer also says she hadn't heard of the claims prior to last week. "I was exhausted, I was tired and‚Äî[when] it came back to me, I was shocked that I even said this myself. Because I was preparing in my mind what I was going to say in the theatre," she said. "And I just went off on something that I shouldn‚Äôt have, and I apologize profusely. I regret it so strongly. I think every woman who knows me, and I have [worked for] them in all sizes and all shapes, all I do want is women being free to express themselves. And that has nothing to do with being disrespected, molested and harassed. Absolutely not."

 She won't be hanging up her Angel wings any time soon. Adriana Lima says that she'll retire from Victoria's Secret when she's 40, which gives the 36-year-old model four more years on the brand's catwalk. "That's something that doesn't come into my head," she told People. "My plan is to stay as long as my body allows me, at least until I am 40, so that's four or so more years. But if I can stay longer, I will."  Lima's fitness trainer, Michael Olajide, Jr, had previously said that the upcoming VS show was set to be the "last time" that his client would model for the brand. The catwalk spectacle will take place in Shanghai for the first time this year. The Brazilian beauty started modelling for VS when she was 18 back in 1999 and was made an Angel two years later.  "It's a huge career opportunity to be in the Victoria's Secret fashion show," she said. "The girls are fun and there's not such a thing as competing with each other."

 A fashion designer who is as famous and recognizable as any movie star, Armani has dressed the great and good of Hollywood‚Äôs nest. Never forget that Giorgio Armani‚Äîor Mr. Armani, as he is often deferentially called‚Äî is a small-town boy. Born in Piacenza, a cathedral town in northwest Italy, in 1934, he grew up dreaming of more for himself. He talks often of his mother‚Äôs rigor and dignity; of the hardships of interwar and postwar Italy. It sounds like the script of an Italian neorealist  lm by Roberto Rossellini or Vittorio De Sica except, of course, that it was real. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs that idea of achieving so much, even with so little,‚Äù says the designer, who has achieved so much. Given Armani‚Äôs backstory, it‚Äôs fitting that the images on these pages‚Äî these scenes, even‚Äîlook like outtakes from a movie. They star Armani alongside Michelle Dockery, who reprises her role as Lady Mary in a big-screen continuation of the period drama Downton Abbey, in theaters this fall. A fashion designer who is as famous and recognizable as any movie star, Armani has dressed the great and good of Hollywood‚Äôs  nest. ‚ÄúCate Blanchett, Leonardo DiCaprio, Kristin Scott Thomas, Richard Gere, Samuel L. Jackson, Jessica Chastain, and Lady Gaga,‚Äù he reels o  names from his studio in Milan.‚ÄúBut the list goes on.‚Äù He left out Sophia Loren, a veritable Armani avatar of understated, timeless Italian style.   Even before Armani began dressing Hollywood‚Äîwhen a young director, Paul Schrader, recruited the breakout star of Italian menswear to dress a near-unknown Richard Gere for the 1980 movie American Gigolo‚Äîthe designer‚Äôs point of view was all allied more with cinema than with fashion. Perhaps alone in the late ‚Äô70s, Armani perceived the bigger picture of fashion not as an adjunct to living but as part of it, and that designers should and could create not just style but a lifestyle. It‚Äôs a hackneyed view today, but then it was revolutionary, as was his idea of dressing actors and actresses on the red carpet. Believe it or not, no one had thought of it before him. ‚ÄúA new generation of actors was emerging in Hollywood, less theatrical in their appearance than the previous generation,‚Äù Armani says of that period. ‚ÄúThey were men and women looking for a new image. Turning to me was,in some way,a natural choice.‚Äù Diane Keaton was the first to wear Armani, in 1978; in 1992, he dressed Best Actress winner Jodie Foster for the Oscars. They wore the designer‚Äôs signature softly structured beige jackets (Foster glitzed hers up with beaded trousers) and looked entirely, applaud- ably, natural. ‚ÄúI think women need clothes that allow them to appear as they are, strong and feminine at the same time,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúClothes that don‚Äôt mask them and don‚Äôt transform them into objects, but rather give them personality and presence.‚Äù Hence the reason his clothes became a hit with Hollywood: When you pretend to be someone else your whole life, on the red carpet you want to be yourself.   For Armani, the world of movies first and foremost was a means of dreaming about something better, and it was an important part of his life growing up. ‚ÄúI belong to the generation that saw  lm as a way to escape reality,‚Äù he says now, having spent the past 40 years dressing movie stars with the aforementioned rigor and dignity. ‚ÄúCinema creates a type of magic that‚Äôs difficult to resist, even today.‚Äù It‚Äôs difficult for Armani to resist, for sure. His fashion shows are staged with a cinematographic eye. This past September, he opted to showcase his Emporio Armani line on a vast, egalitarian scale, in an Emporio Armani‚Äìbranded hangar at Milan‚Äôs Linate airport. Meanwhile, his Giorgio Armani shows have been taking place in the refined confines of his Armani/Teatro and Armani/Silos museum complex, both designed by Tadao Ando. Men and women walked together, adding to a sense of narrative, of interrelation, and romance. It‚Äôs the oldest story in the book: Guy gets girl, girl gets a dress. ‚ÄúIf I didn‚Äôt become a fashion designer, I would have liked to be a director.‚Äù His haute couture, however, is perhaps the most cinematic. For the past two seasons,Armani has staged the collections he calls Armani PriveÃÅ with breathtaking intimacy in hoÃÇtel particuliers, the grand townhouses that were once home to Parisian aristocracy. Walking into the 17th-century, ormolu-swirled HoÃÇtel d‚ÄôEÃÅvreux on Place VendoÃÇme for the Spring 2019 collection in January, beneath its faded mirrors and clinking chandeliers, you felt as though you were stepping into the past. The soundtrack to Bernardo Bertolucci‚Äôs The Conformist played as the models meandered through a warren of rooms, the audience close enough to touch. It was an elegiac experience. It made you dream. Later, for the Bazaar shoot, the same elegant environs frame Dockery, in Lady Mary mode, like a ghost of the past haunting the present. Bar the clothes, which, as always, showcased Armani‚Äôs fascination with the near future, the almost present.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôve often said that if I didn‚Äôt become a fashion designer, I would have liked to be a director,‚Äù says Armani. ‚ÄúI would have liked to direct a  lm about my life, with me played by Paul Newman. I regret never having asked him.‚Äù It‚Äôs easy to imagine Armani achieving it. His empire, a multibillion-dollar behemoth (around $2.7 billion in annual revenue, to be exact), spans not only clothes but also esoteric delights such as Armani/Casa (home), Armani/ Dolci (sweets), and even Armani/Fiori (flowers). He can truly lay claim to having invented a universe‚Äîhis is the rarest of breeds, the fashion auteur.   Like any auteur, Armani exercises complete control. His singularity of vision is unparalleled. I have watched him backstage, and in his atelier preparing for his shows: It is Armani who shapes the garments, building looks on models. He adds and removes accessories, twists garments around and adjusts their fit. There is a retinue of assistants and designers ever present, of course. They include his niece Silvana, who is the head of design for womenswear, and seamstresses from his couture atelier, based in the grand Palazzo Orsini in Milan, who dart forward to, say, stitch down the pleats across the bodice of a dress as Armani places them closer to the body. The designer directs everything, as opposed to employ- ing an outside stylist.‚ÄúFor me, it‚Äôs impossible, very difficult, to imagine somebody else making that decision for me,‚Äù Armani once told me after one of those fittings. ‚ÄúMy job, it‚Äôs not only creating, but also styling. It‚Äôs how things are put together, which is important, it‚Äôs essential.‚Äù Then he paused, smiled. ‚ÄúWe are all stylists.‚Äù Giorgio Armani is a knot of contradictions and paradoxes. His couture expresses that perfectly: It is a wellspring of extravagance for a man known for dressing the world in 50 shades of beige. Similarly, while Armani grounds his clothes resolutely in reality (‚ÄúI ended up in this world because I wanted to dress real people and meet their needs‚Äù), he nevertheless adores the fantasy inherent in cinema. ‚ÄúWhat I love about cinema is its ability to transport,‚Äù Armani says. One could say the same of his fashions.  GET THE LATEST ISSUE OF BAZAAR This article originally appears in the May 2019 issue of Harper‚Äôs BAZAAR, available on newsstands April 23.

 A collection for regular degular shmegular girls.  Is anyone having a better 2018 than Cardi B? It goes without saying the rapper, born Belcalis Almanzar, is conquering the music world and it seems the fashion industry may be next. Her debut album, Invasion of Privacy, dropped on April 6th to much fanfare and praise, with artists like Rihanna and Timbaland raving about her music on social media. The following week the Bronx native performed on Saturday Night Live. The rapper also took this major moment in her career to reveal that she was pregnant after months of speculation. No words were necessary, all it took was a form fitting Christian Siriano gown to confirm the rumors that she was expecting with fiance Offset from Migos. As she's amassed major fame, that also means recognition from the fashion industry. Cardi has appeared in countless magazines, including landing covers of CR Fashion Book, Cosmopolitan, and New York magazine.  It's clear that Cardi is poised to become a new style icon, with stylist Kollin Carter by her side. While she's worn pieces from high-fashion labels like Moschino and Alexander Wang, Cardi is still just a regular girl from the Bronx and loves her high-street wear. So it came as little surprise when Cardi announced this week that she has a collaboration in the works with Fashion Nova, and online retailer for women's clothing that Cardi has been wearing and repping long before her "Bodak Yellow" days.   The line is said to be due out in October this year. Cardi's collection will feature 80-100 pieces, all designed by the rapper herself, from dresses to jeans and outerwear. This will be Fashion Nova's first design collaboration. The brand's CEO Richard Saghian said, "I can‚Äôt think of a better fashion icon for our first design collaboration than Cardi B. Cardi loves the brand and was wearing it before she became famous. She‚Äôs the ultimate fashion muse and has incredible style."  We know her fans would agree as well!
 Models carried human heads, baby dragons, oh, and some handbags too.  You can always count on Gucci to push the envelope with its elaborate runways, but Alessandro Michele took it to the next level today at the fashion house's Fall 2018 show.  Baby dragons, human heads as accessories, a third eye and face masks: these are the key looks in Gucci's cyborg world. Creating a waiting area meets operating room, the brand described its show on Instagram, writing, "the concept reflects the work of a designer‚Äîthe act of cutting, splicing and reconstructing materials and fabrics to create a new personality and identity with them. The materials used are typical of an operating room and the environment around it: PVC on the walls and floors, fire doors with panic-bars, LED lamps, and plastic chairs like those in a waiting room."  Translating that theme into the collection itself, models hit the runway carrying items like human heads, baby dragons and iguanas (fanny packs and crossbody bags are so last season).  To be fair, how else does one outdo the Gucci logo bags that have infiltrated the street style scene and world other than by replacing them with dragon puppies?  And maybe I'll scoop up an iguana for fall too.  Another model walked the runway in what first appeared to be a normal pink party dress, but upon a closer look was covered in a sheer tulle Gucci bodybag (when I die, please make sure my bodybag is Gucci). Oh, she also had a third eye.  Other eye-catching looks from the collection included Kabuki-inspired knitwear and ski masks adorned in jewels.  The inspiration was wide-ranging (there were a whopping total of 90 looks, after all) and included influences from Japanese culture, Middle Eastern culture and even some New York City culture in the form of Yankees gear (thanks to Gucci's new collaboration with the MLB).  As with most Gucci collections, there was a lot to unpack here‚Äìbut it all molded together as yet another boundary-pushing, conversation-starting show from Alessandro Michele.

All fashion savvy ladies know it's best to get dressed from the shoes, up. Ferragamo took that lesson to heart when it named its footwear designer Paul Andrew to creative director recently.

Today's supers, Bella included, walked in the mini skirts, jumpsuits, and one-shouldered dresses that are meant to dance in. It all felt like a welcome youthful surge in Milan. - Kerry Pieri Paul Surridge added a dose of Cavalli boldness by way of technicolor tiger stripes mixed with his own more minimal, structural approach. There was simple suiting and a fantastic black leather coat, alongside poppy hues of yellow and green. It's a new take on Cavalli two years into the creative director's tenure and we're into this fresh direction. -Kerry Pieri  Versace is the ultra-glam label that the all the model girls are wearing when they hit the town. Bella Hadid recently appeared in the campaign for Versace x Kith. In other words, Versace has its eye on the young ones, and the young ones have their eye on the '90s. The theme at today's collection was supposedly "grunge" but through a very Versace lens. Think: those signature Versace prints, knit layers, slip dresses and corsets, and a subtle glam thrift store vibe. Grunge by Donatella sounds like just what the young Millenials ordered. -Kerry Pieri It was a new day at Bottega Veneta. After being helmed by Tomas Maier for 17 years, the fashion house debuted a new look under Daniel Lee for Fall 2019. Interestingly enough, Lee previously worked under Phoebe Philo at Celine‚Äîand his vision at Bottega may just fill the Old Celine void currently plaguing the fashion world. Lee‚Äôs debut collection was minimal without playing it safe‚Äîranging from edgy leathers to feminine dresses. Quilted leather jackets and skirts kicked things off on a tougher note before a series of dresses with sculptural necklines drew attention to the collar bones. Sparkling out from the pack, mirrored shirt dresses added a bit of unexpected playfulness into the collection. Both feminine and edgy, it was the chic minimalism we‚Äôd been missing from Old Celine. ‚ÄîLauren Alexis Fisher

 A charitable tee to spice up your wardrobe. Rumors of a Spice Girls reunion have been swirling for years now. And while we still may not have any definite answers yet (minus this epic reunion photo), Victoria Beckham just designed a Spice Girls t-shirt that will have you feeling all sorts of nostalgic in the meantime.  The limited-edition t-shirt isn't just here to spice up all of our lives, it's also for a good cause. Celebrating girl power, Beckham's $35 t-shirt featuring the Spice Girls will donate 100% of proceeds to Red Nose Day, an organization seeking to end child poverty.  "I travelled to Kenya and saw amazing programs supported by Red Nose Day USA. Girls in these programs are using boxing classes to not only learn self defense, but also leadership‚Äîtapping into their girl power. I was so inspired by the young women I met there. And it‚Äôs not just about being strong in the ring; these girls are future doctors, lawyers, and all around game changers who write their own stories, and will shape the futures of their communities. That‚Äôs girl power," Beckham wrote on Instagram.  THE STORY I travelled to Kenya and saw amazing programs supported by Red Nose Day USA.

 We're looking back at the model's best VSFS looks through the years.  After rumors bubbled up over the weekend, Alessandra Ambrosio confirmed to Entertainment Tonight that, yes, the 2017 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show in Shanghai would be her last. Though the model, 36, has been a staple of the VS runway for the past 17 years, she also has other passions to pursue. "The Brazilian native wants to spend more time on her successful swimsuit line, 'Ale by Alessandra,' and is also looking forward to spending more time on her acting career," ET reports.  Ambrosio first walked the VS runway in 2000, and went on to open (and close) the show, model the fantasy bra (twice) and sport the brand's heaviest set of wings (while pregnant with her second child). She also became the first spokesmodel for Victoria's Secret PINK in 2006.  Needless to say, Ambrosio became a known face of the brand; and the VS fashion show won't be the same without her. Flip through to see her evolution on the Victoria's secret runway.  While pregnant with her second child In VS's heaviest set of wings

The essential leather jacket‚Äîwhich comes in trending variations like faux leather or PVC‚Äîremains a timeless wardrobe staple that never loses its cool-factor.

 Shop the best frames fit just for you.  Sunglasses may seem like a small, minute detail in everyday dressing, but when you find your perfect pair, they become more than a sun-shielding necessity.

 I'll take one in every color, please.  We can always count on Paris Couture Week to deliver the dreamiest of runway looks and today's Valentino Spring 2018 collection was certainly no exception. Featuring unexpected bright colors, over-the-top tulle, statement-making gowns, and incredible beadwork, Pierpaolo Piccioli's spring couture collection for the Italian house was every fashion lover's dream come to life.  Best. Hats. Ever. Brilliant show. @maisonvalentino #couture pic.twitter.com/Ji6xoaxiHA Most notable amongst the glamour-filled collection, however, were the dramatic feathered hats topping off several looks.  The hats, which were designed by Philip Treacy, hit the runway in a multitude of spring hues including hot pink, lavender, and seafoam green.  Forget the baker boy hats, bucket hats, and berets that have been taking over this past season, I'm fully ready to commit to hiding from the outside world underneath a giant feathered hat. Looking like something Joan Collins would wear to a courtroom as Alexis Colby on Dynasty, the over-the-top hat is just the right amount of extra we could all use in our lives in the year of our lord 2018. And, a much-welcomed dose of '80s glamour.  If not for every day life (which, I don't see why you couldn't wear this to the supermarket), there's no denying the hats would make for the perfect divorce court look √† la Alexis Colby.  I'll take one in every color, please.

 Sleek and fun ensembles that pack a sartorial punch, but won't leave you feeling the winter chill.  When the harsh winds and frigid evenings make their entrance, it can be hard to conjure up visions of going-out looks that won't leave you frozen. What do you wear to a night out with friends or a significant other when the Weather App says 24-degrees Fahrenheit and four inches of snow?  For the sartorial set, turtlenecks at the club is no issue and sporting leather trousers at the bar is ideal. Ahead, look to 7 winter going-out looks to recreate this season.  Edgy is in, and so is leather. From trousers to shirts, the options are endless. For your next cocktail hour, look to doubling up on the cool-girl factor with an oversized biker jacket and updated pencil skirt.  Add a little texture and edge to your ensemble with Grlfrnd's Charlie jacket. Not too fancy for brunch, and not too basic for late nights.¬† Set aside your cotton and wool iterations for an office appropriate pencil skirt that packs a punch. This version from Commando is all you'll need for winter events. Picture this: showing up to a girl's night out with your favorite chunky knitwear in place. What could be chicer? Style a heavy sweater with embossed trousers for a cool-girl textural element.  Lock in the heat on your next night out with The Range. This expertly-crafted knit is made of ultra plush cotton and wool to keep you warm all season long.¬† Put aside your staple smooth-leather trousers in favor of Pinko's updated croc-embossed iterations.¬† With a fur coat, the styling options are endless, especially during the cold-weather months. Pair a fluffy fur (or faux) with skinny jeans and knee-high boots that scream, "I'm warm and stylish!" Whatever you wear with this coat will become instantly elevated.¬† There's nothing easier than a jumpsuit‚Äìespecially in the winter time.

Long sleeves, a ribbed texture, and a midi length: this luxe sweater dress from Vince looks great with boots, mules and sneakers.¬† Floral prints in the spring and summer are obvious and necessary, but playing with this pattern during the winter is unexpected and sleek. Keep this weather-appropriate by complementing with an overly embellished outerwear piece.  Stand out for all the right reasons in the cult-favorite Foxy coat from Saks Potts. You won't regret this one, especially when you're bundled up in line for your favorite lounge.¬† With an allover whimsical, '90s-inspired print, Prada's dress is ideal for layering, and a great conversation starter. Wine, anyone?
 Get ready for the summer of the naked sandal.  It's officially time to stow away your worn-down winter boots and usher in a new lineup of sandals for spring and summer. Much to the delight of shoe addicts everywhere, this season is all about the range when it comes to trends. From ultra-sporty sandals to art-inspired heels, there's a little something for every side of the style spectrum this summer. But already standing out from the pack is the return of the barely-there naked sandal. Giving us late '90s and early 2000s vibes, the strappy and minimal sandal is sure to reign as summer's hottest shoe. And we're already eyeing up several pairs to try the look.  From ultra-minimal sandals to snake prints and clear details, these are the 5 shoe trends sure to know and shop for Summer 2019.

Try the high-fashion take on the look with Prada's rubber logo iteration.¬† Or keep is classic with the same Tevas you wore throughout the '90s. Go a little Sporty Spice with a neon and platform take on the look. From skirts to outerwear and accessories, animal prints have been taking over in all forms for several seasons now. This summer, try the look with a pair of luxe snake-print sandals that bring a little something different to your wardrobe of sundresses and breezy blouses.  A comfortable everyday heel and a playful¬†pop of color, you'll want to wear these Schutz sandals¬†all season long.¬† Chlo√©'s tougher take on the look makes a perfect contrast for your white shirtdresses and ultra-feminine pieces.¬† A little bit naked sandal, a little bit animal print, these mules bring on the best of both worlds.¬† Add a little something extra to your summer shoe collection with an artful geometric heel that will take any look to the next level.

Wedges are back‚Äîand these are the perfect place to start.¬† For both a pop of color and a hint of see-through straps.¬† Cinderella, but make it 2019.¬†
 She didn't even audition. It looks like Kendall Jenner won't be joining the lineup of models walking the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show this year. She apparently didn't even audition because she's scored a "multi-million dollar deal" as the face of La Perla, a one of VS's lingerie competitors, a source close to the Kardashians told TMZ. Jenner's contract reportedly includes a "non-compete clause," so modeling for VS was not an option. Jenner made her VS fashion show debut in 2015, and returned to the catwalk in 2016. If you'll miss seeing the 21-year-old reunite with her model pals (including Gigi and Bella Hadid) on the wing-filled runway this year, you can still catch plenty of her sporting lingerie on her and La Perla's Instagram. The 2017 VS fashion show takes place in Shanghai this year, and will be broadcast on CBS on November 28. 
 The supermodel looked flawless in the sheer gown. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. As London Fashion Week is underway, Naomi Campbell's Fashion for Relief runway show went down Saturday night at The British Museum. And it attracted several famous faces. Models Adut Akech, Stella Maxwell, and Alexa Chung were all in attendance, but it was Campbell's arrival that caught everyone's attention. Campbell posed in a jaw-dropping black gown featuring several sheer panels with delicate sequined adornments‚Äîand very little else. The supermodel appeared to be wearing the see-through dress without underwear.  Campbell also posed on the red carpet with Akech, who was recently featured on Meghan, Duchess of Sussex's guest-edited British Vogue cover. Campbell set up the charitable foundation in 2005 after being encouraged by Nelson Mandela. Per Campbell on the official Fashion for Relief website, "He always said to use my voice to speak out about things that I care about, to speak up and do something. Fashion for Relief is dedicated to improving the lives of those living in adversity, by uniting the fashion industry as a force for good."   The organization regularly gives money to a number of charities and causes, with the website noting that since its inception, Fashion for Relief has raised "over $15 million for good causes around the world."
 The supermodel invited Bazaar along for a sneak peek of her fitting.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. "I've been away for a little less than a year, and it's going to be exciting to be back on the runway," Candice Swanepoel told Bazaar during her late August Victoria's Secret Fashion Show fitting. While most women would be frightened to be standing in a room filled with people in just a red halter bra and matching panties‚ÄîSwanepoel looked as comfortable as ever, and ready to reclaim her coveted wings for her 10th anniversary show. The South African beauty sat out last year's Victoria's Secret Fashion Show in Paris due to maternity leave‚Äîshe gave birth to her first child, a son named Anaca, in October of 2016. However, the 29-year-old supermodel says motherhood hasn't changed her perspective on her career much‚Äîshe just has less time, especially when it comes to working out. "When I'm done taking care of him, I try to do a half hour workout every two days, two-three days. That's been working for me a lot more because I can't spend hours in the gym... and taking care of him, he's really heavy, so he's a workout."  Watch as Swanepoel gets ready to make her return to the lingerie extravaganza in Shangahi and gets fitted for her look in the "nomadic adventure" section. As the show walked yesterday, it seems that Swanepoel traded up for a pair of bigger wings, and her first set went to VS rookie Grace Bol. 
 There are some Kim Kardashian lookalikes in the bunch, too. Though he's been busy releasing new music for the past few weeks, Kanye West has been on his design hustle, too. Last night, the rapper-turned-designer debuted a new campaign for his Yeezy 500 Supermoon sneaker  campaign on Twitter, and it turned heads to say the least.  The shots feature a diverse roster of models wearing West‚Äôs new footwear, along with other Yeezy pieces like sports bras, leggings, and sweatshirts. But a few models really wore nothing but the shoe. One of them included adult-film actress Lela Star (who has an uncanny resemblance to West's wife, Kim Kardashian).   
  The campaign was photographed by Eli Linnetz (who shot the 2017 Kardashian Christmas card). He shared another revealing angle from the shoot.   #SUPERMOON by me A post shared by  ERL (@elirusselllinnetz) on Jun 12, 2018 at 1:15pm PDT The Clermont twins also made an appearance, wearing only the Supermoon sneakers, socks, and biker shorts.   There was also this faceless model, who posed topless but sported grey shorts, Calabasas socks, and Yeezy kicks.  Not all models were nude. Some wore Yeezy's signature oversized sweaters and biker shorts (√† la Kim Kardashian), others even sported jeans.  The roster also included younger-looking models, including a child.  This isn't the first time Kanye has launched a new campaign on social media. For his recent collections, Kim has worn his design in public and shared the paparazzi photos online to debut the clothes. He also enlisted other models including Paris Hilton, Amina Blue, and Sami Miro to pose as Kim lookalikes for the shots, resulting in a full-on social media swarm. 
 The designer will be donating meals for every photo posted with the hashtag #WatchHungerStop for the cause today.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. This World Food Day, you can help Michael Kors end global hunger simply by taking a selfie in the designer‚Äôs new Watch Hunger Stop t-shirt designed by Insta-famous artist Clym Evernden (@clymdraws.) For every post tagged with #WatchHungerStop, Kors will donate 50 meals to the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP). Now in its 5th year, the designer‚Äôs Watch Hunger Stop initiative in partnership with WFP raises funds and awareness to help achieve food security and improved nutrition for the one in nine people worldwide still do not have enough to eat. This year‚Äôs t-shirt will be given away‚Äîno purchase necessary‚Äîat select Michael Kors stores around the world, and if you‚Äôre in NYC stop by the Soho store today from 12-2pm to see the artist himself drawing live on the windows. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always loved creating ‚Äòbrushed‚Äô text with black ink, so for the campaign design I decided to work with the ‚ÄòWatch Hunger Stop‚Äô text and somehow introduce a figurative element of artwork within these series of words,‚Äù explains Evernden. ‚ÄúThe idea occurred to me to make the ‚ÄòO‚Äô in ‚ÄòSTOP‚Äô a loose ink interpretation of the Earth, and elevate its presence by using a blue aqua colored ink. The Earth is an important artistic icon for the campaign as it represents a global effort.‚Äù

 This is Alexander Wang's America.  Veering away from the traditional Fashion Week calendar, Alexander Wang took to a rooftop at South Street Seaport last night to embark on his new June/December show schedule.  For the first show of Wang's new chapter, dubbed 'Collection 1,' the designer presented his own version of "Immigrant Americana," which included Axl Rose-inspired bandanas, references to Chinatown, a ton of safety pins, and yes, Childish Gambino.  Though immigration may be a controversial topic in America right now, Wang's inspiration came from more of a personal standpoint rather than political. The collection was inspired by his parents, who immigrated to the country in 1973. Though they've been separated for 20 years, the designer reunited the two of them recently for a Californian road trip where he asked about their immigration story.  "I was inspired by them coming here and not speaking English, going to the grocery store and not knowing how to buy food, and all the jobs they had to do to build a better life for me. And taking that story and infusing it with pop culture Americana references that I grew up with like American football, motorcycle Harley Davidson culture, and rock ‚Äôn‚Äô roll music. And then taking Chinoiserie and my heritage and infusing it into that world. I wanted to find a new way to express inclusivity and create a new narrative of what that might look like," Wang said backstage after the show.  Making the collection even more special, last night marked the first time the designer's dad attended one of his runway shows. For the occasion, he was decked out in head-to-toe Wang logo, of course.  As for the runway itself, the show kicked off with some heavy rock music blasting on an all-white rooftop overlooking the Brooklyn Bridge and New York skyline. Models hit the runway in Axl Rose bandanas, biker shorts, leather jackets, safety pin designs, Hawaiian leis, and even Wang's take on football jerseys.  The lineup included plenty of members from the #WangSquad like Bella Hadid, Anna Ewers, Kaia Gerber, and Behati Prinsloo in her first runway appearance since giving birth. In the front row, Jourdan Dunn, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, A$AP Ferg, and Pusha T watched on.  With heavy metal, Chinoiserie, and Western influences (along with cheeky 'Made in China' decals), the collection made for a giant melting pot of Americana culture‚Äîand that was precisely Wang's point.  The powerful finale was set to the backdrop of Childish Gambino's "This Is America," which perhaps summed up Alexander Wang's take on Immigrant Americana best.  This is @alexanderwangny‚Äôs America üá∫üá∏ The designer presented his first show outside the traditional fashion calendar, Collection One, tonight in New York. #WangUSA A post shared by  Harper's BAZAAR (@harpersbazaarus) on Jun 3, 2018 at 6:18pm PDT

 Viktor & Rolf debuted our entire 2019 mood board in couture form.  There was once a time when slogan t-shirts were enough to get all our feelings across. But if you've logged onto the internet at all in the year 2019, you know your little graphic tees aren't sufficiently expressing your rage anymore. It's time to go big with slogan couture instead.  Giving us the statement pieces we didn't know we needed, Viktor & Rolf debuted a collection of slogan gowns today at Paris Couture Week. With messages like "I'm not shy, I just don't like you," "Sorry I'm late, I didn't want to come," and "NO," the voluminous gowns are here to turn us all into the walking memes we aspire to be in the Year of Our Lord 2019.  How does one wear a slogan couture gown? Let us count all of the ways below...  For when you're walking into another meeting that could've been an email.    A walking mood board for the year 2019.  An ironic look for when you're begging every person within a 5-mile radius to take a good Instagram of you.  I'll take one in every color, please.  A romantic Valentine's Day dress you can wear year-round.   One of the collection's more versatile slogan gowns, wear it to your next protest, your ex's funeral, or when they tell you "guac is extra" in line at Chipotle.  For when your friends say, "it's just a casual get together, nothing fancy."  Perhaps someone will get inspired for their 2020 campaign slogan.  For when nobody's liking your Instagram.  The new "whatever, I'm getting cheese fries."   For when people ask you for dating advice.   A day-to-night dress for when you're scrolling through the news on your phone.   The three most romantic words in the English language.  And finally, an everyday lewk that works for every single occasion. 
 Edie Campbell has penned a powerful public letter addressing the ill treatment of fashion models and urging the industry to put an end to systematic abuse and negligence.  The model‚Äîwho has starred in campaigns for Burberry, Marc Jacobs, and Louis Vuitton‚Äîvoiced her frustration at how recent media coverage on the issue seems to only address abuse claims concerning Terry Richardson, when in reality it goes far beyond one man. In the wake of the Harvey Weinstein allegations, model Cameron Russell shared a number of horrifying stories that she‚Äôd heard about within the world of fashion. She used Instagram to share screenshots of messages sent to her by friends, colleagues and followers detailing the abuse they have received. ‚ÄúSince Cameron Russell enlisted the help of many fashion people to share the stories of sexual abuse she had been sent‚Äîanonymously‚Äîby other models, the conversation has only focused on Terry Richardson,‚Äù wrote Campbell in her letter published in WWD.‚ÄúMedia coverage has been frustratingly limited to Richardson. Broadsheet newspapers write clickbait articles that avoid the more nuanced and complex truth, which is this: the models that shared their stories with Cameron were not all talking about the same photographer.‚Äù She also addressed the harassment suffered by male models, whose voices, as yet, remain largely unheard and their stories untold by the press. ‚ÄúAbuse suffered by young men is more complex,‚Äù argues Campbell. ‚ÄúI would assume that it is more difficult for the victims to speak out: The language doesn‚Äôt exist, and the conversation is currently weighted heavily in support of young female victims. The shame felt is probably greater as there is a stigma involved.  ‚ÄúThe abuse can be perceived as emasculating, and then there is the delicate subject of homophobia,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúThe global conversation about sexual abuse has been (possibly rightly) focused on female victims. The statistics add up. But when you zoom in on the fashion industry, I would assume that the numbers are much more evenly split between male and female victims. Within fashion, the discussion then becomes less about toxic masculinity and patriarchy, and more about abuse of power.‚Äù While Campbell has no first-hand experience of the abuse detailed by her model peers, she does attempt to explain why it happens and why it‚Äôs tolerated by those who work within the industry. She highlights the lack of professional boundaries in fashion (‚ÄúI undress in front of the people I work with, I travel with these people, I get drunk with them, they ask me who I‚Äôm shagging‚Äù); she notes how behaving like a diva is accepted, even celebrated and also makes the point that fashion hates ‚Äúboring or uncool people.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe operate within a culture that is too accepting of abuse, in all of its manifestations. This can be the ritual humiliation of models, belittling of assistants, power plays and screaming fits,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe have come to see this as simply a part of the job. Although we may not all, as individuals, have actively contributed to this culture, every time we turn a blind eye, our silence perpetuates that culture. Our inaction makes us complicit.‚Äù She goes on to talk about the perils of the ‚Äúartist-genius‚Äù complex (an issue recently addressed in Darren Aronofsky‚Äôs divisive film, mother!), whereby influential, powerful creatives are ‚Äúallowed to behave in any way you see fit, and you inspire total fear and devotion from your followers‚Äù.  ‚ÄúIf you are creative, and if your work is good, you will be forgiven anything,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúYou are given carte blanche to express that creativity, whatever your means of expression may be. And if that creativity only flows after midnight, and if it only responds to semi-nude young men or women, then so be it.‚Äù

 It's a cardi party and everyone's invited This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. The cardigan is a humble article of clothing‚Äîsimple in design, varied in color and length‚Äîbut it holds some strong associations. Most think of preppy ladies in pearls when the cardigan is mentioned, but any fashion girl worth her salt can turn it on its head and make it unmistakably "her." At its best the cardigan serves as a layering piece that can lend interest‚Äîand utility. See how five BAZAAR editors take on the cardi and style it for everything from work to weekend to date night, shot on location at NYC's The Surrey Hotel. Gilded buttons take a classic cardi to cool places... What‚Äôs your general opinion on classic cardigans? Every woman needs some form of a cardigan in her closet‚Äîthey‚Äôre especially good for layering options when traveling.Are you here for them?When worn right, I think they can look really cool. Right now, I‚Äôm into a cropped cardigan that feels like something Cher Horowitz would wear. Bonus points if it has a matching skirt to go with.  What do they make you think of? Cardigans always make me think of Easter Sunday church attire and cold grandmas, which maybe is not the greatest combination but I‚Äôm always here for a fashion challenge. How did you style this one?I went for a cropped cardigan with gold clasps that felt a little more ‚Äò90s and a little less school teacher.Where would you wear this outfit and why?I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be hitting the clubs in my cardigan, but this is definitely an office look. A heavier cardi is still flattering when paired with high waisted trousers... What‚Äôs your general opinion on classic cardigans? I've actually been a little skeptical of the cardigan, those long, shapeless ones hurt their rep with me‚Äîbut I came of age in the era of the twinset and there's no denying that when worn well (think skewed preppy) that look is straight cute. What do they make you think of? I go straight to '90s pastel hued Versace‚Äîsuch a good moment in fashion history.   Are you here for them? I am here officially here for the cardigan, especially this very cool Doen one. It's cozy, cool and makes me think of Jackie Kennedy at Hyannis‚Äîthe life I would ultimately like to live.  How did you style this one? I kept the overall theme beachy by pairing it with a cropped shirt and linen Miguelina beach pants‚ÄîI even threw on a head scarf for good measure. Give your cardi a sporty edge with varsity-inspired separates... What‚Äôs your general opinion on classic cardigans?Cardigans have always been a bit too preppy for my taste. Are you here for them now?I am if there‚Äôs a sport twist to them. It‚Äôs really all about how you style them.   What do they make you think of?Girls in pearls. How did you style this one?I love playing with masculine/feminine pieces in one outfit. My cardigan is varsity inspired, so I kept the look sporty and paired it with wide-leg trousers that had stripes on the side. But I also layered a lace bra under the cardigan for a flirty touch.  Where would you wear this outfit and why?  I think this look really works day to night so I‚Äôd wear this to work on a day I had an event afterwards. Use a cropped cardi and a fitted pencil skirt to show off a baby bump instead of hiding it... What‚Äôs your general opinion on classic cardigans? That they are a closet staple! While not always in high-fashion rotation, you need a selection of cardigans for weekend-wear, traveling, and covering up your shoulders in a pinch. Right now, the selection is way more fun and inspired, so I‚Äôm expanding my classic collection with a few statement ones. Are you here for them? Yes! Being pregnant is all about comfort and if I can make something cozy and stylish, I‚Äôm sold. What do they make you think of? A long one feels classic librarian, while a short cropped one (with high waisted jeans), is the epitome of casual '70s chic. How did you style this one? The cardi is open-weave which made it less structured, more drapey, so I paired it with a fitted black dress and super-high espadrilles to keep the silhouette lean overall. I added statement accessories like cat-eyes and my favorite gingham summer bag by Mansur Gavriel. Where would you wear this outfit and why? It‚Äôs truly a perfect work look for me, our offices are not too corporate, but the dress and heels keeps in a work-friendly zone. Wear your cardi buttoned-up as a top... What‚Äôs your general opinion on classic cardigans? Classic cardigans are exactly that‚Äìa classic‚Äìbut I‚Äôve always associated them with ladies who lunch, prim and proper housewives and uptown dressing. Are you here for them? I‚Äôm an uptown girl, but my style is a bit more of an uptown-meets-downtown hybrid and so I never really thought cardigans were for me. I am also a bit top heavy‚ÄìI have a bigger bust‚Äìand so I‚Äôm always super conscious of sizing up whenever I wear tops that button up. With that said, I‚Äôm a ‚Äò90s baby; I love Cher Horowitz and old-school Britney circa Oops I Did It Again. Anything with that subtle (or not so subtle) school girl vibe speaks to me for sure.  What do they make you think of? Pretty much everything I loved as a kid‚Äìcardis are nostalgic to me. Jackie O, Versace circa Gianni, Cher Horowitz, Britney Spears and the Spice Girls. How did you style this one? Rather than using the cardigan as a top layer or as a top itself, I used it as a shell for a short suit. I tied the bottom corners into a knot at my waist to create some waist definition, and opened up the neckline to show a little skin. I chose a proper tuxedo blazer and a silk skort (yes, a skort) to keep the look more formal, and chose a pointed toe blush pump with a statement heel to elongate my legs (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 and always trick people into thinking I‚Äôm taller with styling tricks!).

 These aren't your usual non-groundbreaking florals.  Moschino's Jeremy Scott is known to take the themes of his collections quite literally (in case you forgot, last season's models wore actual trash down the runways) and his show in Milan today was no exception. For Spring 2018, the designer was inspired by florals‚Äîand no, not the kind that would make Miranda Priestly scoff‚Äìbut actual life-size flowers.  While the show started with a punk-twist on My Little Pony, the final 18 looks quickly flipped a switch, embracing blown-up flowers, butterflies, and nature in bloom. Taking the floral theme to new heights, Gigi Hadid and Kaia Gerber closed the show wearing matching bouquets of flowers‚Äîribbons and all:  Gerber even had flowers growing out of her white over-the-knee boots, which seems like a logical way to make winter boots work for spring.  But those weren't the only flower-inspired looks. Joan Smalls walked the runway in a skirt made out of red roses:  While another model wore a callalily-shaped gown: And then this model just wore nothing but a shrub of flowers from head-to-toe: Guess this means we'll all be walking around dressed as human flowers next spring. 
 The documentary is due for release on July 20, 2018. The new trailer for McQueen, the long-awaited documentary about the late Alexander McQueen, has arrived, and it's simply stunning. Due for release in the US on July 20, 2018, the movie is directed by Ian Bonh√¥te and Peter Ettedgui,and  promises to explore every aspect of the influential designer's life. From interviews with the designer himself, to personal insights into McQueen's upbringing and artistic influences, the movie's latest trailer hints at the demons the artist struggled with. The film also promises to shed light on what many call the "genius" of McQueen's work, and the immense impact he had upon the fashion world. The trailer begins with a voice saying, "No one discovered Alexander McQueen. Alexander McQueen discovered himself." This is followed by footage of McQueen himself revealing, "I wasn't very good at school. I was always drawing clothes." As for the effect he wanted his fashion shows to have on the audience, the designer revealed that he aimed to have a visceral impact on his audience. He said, "I want you to feel repulsed or exhilarated." This behind-the-scenes footage, and the plethora of personal interviews with the designer himself, will give fans a unique look at the man responsible for some of fashion's most unforgettable moments. McQueen passed away on February 11, 2010, at the age of 40, due to suicide.  Incredibly accomplished throughout his career, he was the chief designer at Givenchy from 1996 to 2001. He then went on to found the Alexander McQueen label, which is still beloved by celebrities and members of the general public alike.

 Take all our money, Khaite...  With Rodarte and Altuzarra, fleeing New York Fashion Week for other far flung destinations, it's left a fashion fan girl sized hole in the calendar. Cate Holstein came to fill that last night for her runway debut for her line Khaite, which debuted in 2016 as a nod to old school American fashion. It was all class at the Brooklyn presentation last night, where guests were greeted with chilled Ketel martinis and a golden tree, lit from above. Holding onto the idea of true American style, the designer looked to, "historical flashpoints of American character and feminine identity." Think: a Western fringed jacket in suede,  a wrap coat with top stitch detail, there are classic plaids and bold shoulders, velvet statement tops and ball gowns. All of it came together, not so much effortlessly as elegantly. This is a girl who is thinking about what she's wearing, it's calculated, it's cool and it feels very New York. Just where she's needed most. 
 Prepare yourself for some major fashion inspiration. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. Do you ever wonder how your favorite editors manage to look so effortlessly chic without finance salaries? Fortunately for you, in this episode of This Look Is Money we tapped three well-dressed editors who give us the stories (and price tags) behind their impeccable outfits for New York Fashion Week and beyond. Who are you wearing? How much did it cost? What favors are you calling in? Think: something old, something new, something borrowed, and something bought resale. Prepare yourself for some major fashion inspiration.   "I am a consignment queen," declares Angel Lenise, the lead video producer at ELLE.com. "I love luxury labels, I love quality products, but I don't always love to buy them full price."  Case in point: Her leopard print, pointed toe, high-heeled booties from Gianvito Rossi and green cargo pants by Monse are both from consignment website The RealReal. She's especially proud of the pants because she snagged them for 50 percent off. Lenise is also "obsessed" with Pyer Moss, a luxury streetwear label that is known for celebrating black culture and activism. (Founder Kerby Jean-Raymond was the winner of the 2018 CFDA Fashion Fund prize). Her black cropped hoodie that says "AS USA AS U" is part of the line's recent collaboration with Reebok. "I think it's awesome when fashion makes a statement," says Lenise.   She's also sporting a khaki puffer jacket from The Arrivals‚Äì"It's peak street style chic 101"‚Äìto stay cozy in the harsh New York City winter. Her gold-toned, cat-eyed sunglasses are from Jimmy Choo and she picked up her Jenny Bird hoop earrings from Intermix. "I was talking to the designer behind Seville Michelle, and I told her [that] her chokers are amazing, and she literally gave me this off her neck. I've worn it religiously ever since," says Lenise of her two-tone necklace. For Christmas, Lenise's husband gifted her a green suede mini bag from Jacquemus. "When he got it in the mail, he was going to send it back because he didn't realize it was supposed to be this tiny," Lenise says with a smile. She appreciates that she can rock the bag as a crossbody, fanny pack style across her waist, or carry it as a handle bag.  One splurge (and form of self-expression) Lenise will never give up is her monthly $140 manicure at Vanity Projects nail salon in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan. Outfit Total: $2525   Next up is Olivia Fleming, BAZAAR.com's senior features editor and designer behind fine-jewelry brand Olivia Kane. The New Zealand-born and NYC-based editor picked up her multicolor (and reversible) floral skirt at a flea market in Portland. In the winter she wears the darker side that has mini yellow, blue, and orange blooms throughout. While in the Spring she wears it on the turquoise side with larger pink flowers.  She cinches her waist with a brown, leather belt from Australian fashion designer Lisa Ho. "I wear a lot of high-waisted things. So I pair it with everything from skirts, jeans, and shorts," she says of her accessory staple for the last ten years.   Fleming's charcoal, knee-high, suede boots with a tortoiseshell heel are from Sarah Flint. "They're $695, so they're a little pricey, but I love them. They're worth every penny. They're like leg warmers in freezing New York City," she says. Her chain-link shoulder bag is from British brand Love Or Nothing Baby (LONB), and is available at Barneys. "I wear a lot of dark colors in the winter time, so I love this ivory-bone handbag because it's a pop of fresh color in the winter," she adds.  Fleming accessorized her look with a chain necklace with a lion medallion from an antique shop in Hudson, New York. She wears her own stunning rings, which she makes for her jewelry brand, Olivia Kane.  Outfit Total: $5995   Closing out this episode of This Look is Money is Erica Gonzales, BAZAAR.com's assistant editor and resident Game of Thrones aficionado. Gonzales is rocking a moss green, belted jumpsuit from & Other Stories that she picked up during a 50 percent off sale ($75). Her tweed coat from Sisely previously belonged to her aunt, and when Gonzales inherited the piece, she tailored it a bit to flatter her figure.  "My [quilted leather] bag is vintage Lanvin, and it used to be my mother's. She got it in college from her aunt," she says of her family heirloom. "It's very precious. It's essentially priceless." She elevated her laidback-yet-cool look with a pair of attention-grabbing white, leather mules with a metallic heel from Australian brand Senso.  Another Aussie designer Gonzales is rocking her black, oval-shaped, metallic frame sunglasses are from Quay. Her pair sunnies are from the company's collaboration with Lovers and Friends.  Gonzales's delicate, 18-carat gold hoop earrings are from Missoma, a brand inspired by crystals and gemstones. "And finally, I have this little hairclip; it was probably about six dollars in a set of four," she says of her affordable beauty find. "It's a really nice callback to one of my favorite middle school hairstyles when I just wear my hair down the center with two little clips down the side."

 Ireland opens up to HarpersBAZAAR.com about the scary incident. Kathy Ireland has worked in the modeling industry for over four decades, and in light of the #MeToo and Time's Up movements, she is opening up about the time she got physical with a photographer who "crossed the line" at a photoshoot. "When I was 17, I punched a photographer before walking off the set," Ireland exclusively tells Harper's BAZAAR at the American Heart Association's Go Red for Women event in New York Thursday. "I‚Äôm not a violent person, but somebody crosses that boundary with you, the rules of politeness go out the window. He crossed the line with me." The 54-year-old supermodel-turned-mogul, best known for appearing on 13 consecutive Sports Illustrated swimsuit issues, says the unnamed photographer tried to force her to wear an outfit she did not want to wear. "He was trying to get me to wear something that I wasn‚Äôt comfortable wearing," she explains. "I said, 'No, no thank you.' Then I said no [again]. And he was insistent, and he got in my personal space and got too close." Ireland says the incident occurred in France, and did not reveal whether the photographer is currently still working the industry. At the time, the underage model immediately told people involved in the shoot what had occurred, but according to Ireland, they did nothing. "I reported him and the question was ‚ÄòWell, what do you want us to do about it?'" she tells BAZAAR. "I said, ‚ÄòGet him away from all the other girls. I don‚Äôt want another girl to be hurt by him. I got away, but someone else might not be so fortunate.'"  "I don‚Äôt think [those people] cared, honestly," she adds. "They heard me. I believe they believed me, but I don‚Äôt think they really cared."  Ireland says the modeling industry's job description back then was "shut up and pose." "I reject that today," she says. "We‚Äôve got to speak out and make sure that our voices are heard."  The mother of three, who is an advocate against child slavery and human trafficking, wants victims to continue to speak out.  You can't be casual about Human Trafficking @ywca_gla #ConversationsInACafe @JanetJackson @flytetymejam pic.twitter.com/YzOjZxcxbC "It‚Äôs heartbreaking to know that there are so many women and men who have been abused and their voices have not been heard," she says. "No job is that important. I encourage people to come forward and speak out." When asked about Kate Upton's recent accusations against Guess co-founder Paul Marciano, Ireland says, "I love Kate Upton and my heart goes out to her."

 Bella Hadid and Kaia Gerber also hit the Menswear runway. Milan Fashion Week for Menswear is in full swing, but that hasn't stopped several famous women from hitting the runway for some of your favorite designers. Per Footwear News, Versace's Milan Fashion Week Men's runway also featured a slew of famous female models, all of whom epically stole the spotlight. Firstly, Emily Ratajkowski stunned in a silky, lace-trimmed camisole-like minidress, which was accessorized with a super long, and extremely tight, ponytail, which had more moves than all of us put together: Seriously, look at how slick Ratajkowski's ponytail is on the runway. It's clearly a meme-in-waiting: I am in serious AWE, and will never achieve such hair greatness: The actress and model also shared a photo from her Versace fitting, which gives a much closer look at her iconic gold accessories: Fitting headshots @Versace pic.twitter.com/DxsYp8tPKd Ratajkowski was joined on the runway by Bella Hadid and Kaia Gerber.

 The collaboration officially drops on November 7th.  Giambattista Valli is all about making an entrance, whether it's gowns in eye-catching prints, or a mini dress with an unforgettable train. So, it's no surprise that to debut his collaboration with H&M, he tapped Kendall Jenner, Chiara Ferragni, and H.E.R. to show off dresses from his limited-edition drop at the epic amfAR gala during Cannes Film Festival. But that was really just a small taste of what was to come. The full Giambattista Valli x H&M collection will finally be available on November 7th. The Italian designer weaves his signature romantic, luxe bohemian styles into pieces tthat won't break the bank‚Äîand are perfect for this upcoming holiday's party circuits.  Below, we chatted with the designer about his process in creating the affordable collection, plus see all the women's looks from the lookbook.  I was very humbled when H&M approached me. I don't think that H&M knocks on the door of every designer‚Äì but they came to mine and it is an exciting moment for the Maison. Besides the honor of being asked and being in excellent company with past designers, I was extremely happy that this collaboration would allow me to share my love for beauty with an even broader audience and make the biggest number of people happy wearing my creations for special moments in their lives. I love creating beautiful, extraordinary pieces for the Valli Boys and Girls around the world and I am excited at the idea that they will be able to afford and collect something so unique, with the distinct silhouette that defines the DNA of my brand. The design process was certainly very different ‚Äîwith H&M being so industrial, the fabrics and the techniques have been adapted to a lower price point. I see this collaboration more of another chapter than a 'best of' in the history of Giambattista Valli, with the collection being adapted to embrace the H&M customer while still conveying the spirit of Giambattista Valli and remaining 100% honest when it comes to the shapes, silhouettes and attitude.  From conception to execution was in no way different from when I sit down at my desk with a blank piece of paper in front of me: after that moment of introspection, I start sketching. What comes after is just about careful selection to use the best ingredients to make what I had imagined turn into reality. This time was no different with the exception that I knew I would have the H&M customer joining my other clients. What I was adamant about it that like any of my collections the whole collaboration had to be executed with perfection in mind and the details of each piece is proven in the results. The collaboration was great way to understand how the Maison Giambattista Valli is perceived. It was a challenge to create and deliver the universe of Giambattista Valli on such a large scale but now seeing the amazing reaction to the first limited-edition drop, with people around the world sharing their beautiful moments in life wearing Giambattista Valli x H&M looks, and considering the reach of the collaboration announcement on social media exceeding more than half a billion people, it surprised me as much as it made me happiest to bring the Valli dream to a larger group of friends through this collaboration. I love every single piece of the collection, to me they feel like unique collector pieces rather than throw-away garments produced based on trends. They are timeless and meant to be kept in one‚Äôs wardrobe, to mix and match to the customer‚Äôs personal style, embracing their personality, which is also an approach in line with a very important concept that all of us in the industry should embrace :sustainability. I truly treasure the span of offering and the variety of pieces from this collection : from street and daywear to evening and party looks, customers can enjoy the world of Giambattista Valli. I am also very proud of having approached menswear for the first time with this collaboration, although I always design for characters, regardless of their gender. Freedom of expression is the ultimate luxury, not the value of the price tag ! Ideas come from my muse, which is my curiosity, my travels and my culture, which is stored inside of me, inside the archives of my own mind. They are there and I visit them to pick up whatever inspires the moment I am living in. It has been a constant progress of evolution. It is important to translate my vision of contemporanity through a narrative, I never forget when I create that there is always someone‚Äî a friend, a client, amuse, someone I notice in my wandering ‚Äî who will be the final recipient of this piece and its original ideas being my creation. That is something that never happens to me, on the contrary, I‚Äôm someone with too many ideas. The most interesting moment in my process is when I find myself in front of a blank piece of paper and start to sketch, in the beginning of every collection; it is then that I entangle, tidy up and pick from the many references in my mind to create a narrative.  Although I love to travel and discover new cultures and countries and continue to do so every time I can, the ultimate luxury in today‚Äôs world to me is privacy, so I share and cherish these special moments each summer with my family and closest friends in Italy. My happy times.
 The designer teamed up with Trojan for a cheeky capsule collection.  In honor of Pride Month, Alexander Wang is teaming up with Trojan Condoms for a "Protect Your Wang" capsule collection benefitting the LGBT Center of New York. The limited-edition collection includes a hat, t-shirt, bandana, and socks‚Äîall of which are emblazoned with the message "Protect Your Wang." Serving as the pi√®ce de r√©sistance of the collaboration, however, are the Alexander Wang-branded condoms (because how have we made it this far without cheeky designer condoms in our lives?). A free Wang condom will come with every item purchased from the collection, but the designer himself (along with the #WangSquad) will also be handing them out on Sunday, June 24 at the New York City Pride March. As part of the collab, Wang additionally created a Protect Your Wang parade float that will be at this year's march.  ‚ÄúPride has always been one of my favorite moments of the year, and it‚Äôs even more amazing when you can engage with your friends and fans to share an important message that promotes wellness within the LGBTQ community. Partnering with Trojan to bring the ‚ÄòProtect Your Wang' collection to life has been an inspiring way to create products that have further purpose in supporting initiatives we are both passionate about," Alexander Wang said in a statement from the brand.

 Seriously, all 100. Heaven on earth finally has an address: 611 5th Avenue, New York City. That's the location of Saks Fifth Avenue‚Äôs recently renovated main floor‚Äîand a paradise for all handbag aficionados. Of course, paradise is nothing without loved ones; the renovation includes the arrival of a huge collection of limited-edition luxury bags (also available at Saks.com). And the gang is all here: a Balenciaga top handle, a Prada Cahier crossbody, and other major handbags that made fashion history now call the store home. Each is just as iconic as ever, but a bit different. And a little more... exclusive.   ‚ÄúWe have 100 handbags from the top fashion houses that you won't find anywhere else,‚Äù says Roopal Patel, Fashion Director of Saks Fifth Avenue. ‚ÄúThe main floor of Saks has been completely transformed into the most iconic handbag destination in NYC.‚Äù  Each of those 100 new bags is an updated take on a classic. "We asked designers to riff on their favorite handbag styles and reimagine them for today,‚Äù explains Patel.  SEE THE PRICE  SEE THE PRICE SEE THE PRICE SEE THE PRICE For example, the Christian Louboutin Paloma bag still features the same structural design and the brand‚Äôs signature red lining, but this latest iteration gets an embellished facelift with a sweet floral motif. The Givenchy GV3 Crossbody Bag remains distinguishable‚Äîwith its magnetic double G clasp and golden chain‚Äîbut far from flashy in a specially-designed-for-Saks two-tone colorway.  ‚ÄúIt was really interesting to learn about the background and history surrounding some of these iconic shapes,‚Äù she adds. ‚ÄúEveryone was so excited to be part of this special moment at Saks.‚Äù SEE THE PRICE SEE THE PRICE SEE THE PRICE SEE THE PRICE The new floor is a mix of the top luxury designers‚Äîlike Fendi, Stella McCartney, and Valentino Garavani‚Äîand contemporary American brands, like Staud and Susan Alexandra. The latter, known for her acrylic beaded carryalls, now offers a delectable pretzel design‚Äîreplacing any gluten guilt with pure fashion fun. SEE THE PRICE SEE THE PRICE SEE THE PRICE SEE THE PRICE After all, it's a celebration of Saks‚Äô grand renovation. Goodies come in all shapes and sizes‚Äîbeyond the handbag dimensions. ‚ÄúThe space offers something new every visit, from artist takeovers to pop-up installations,‚Äù says Patel. ‚ÄúThere's also a multitude of onsite options to personalize your bag, including live hand-painting and monogramming.‚Äù See? Must be heaven.

 The British fashion house stopped using fur last year. Burberry has pledged to eliminate plastic by 2025, according to a report published by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation‚Äîan organization designed to help fashion brands transition to a circular economy. In October 2018, the luxury label joined the likes of Stella McCartney and H&M in signing the New Plastics Economy Global Commitment which aims to reduce global fashion waste. One of the biggest goals of the project is to ensure all packaging used by leading fashion businesses is recyclable by 2025‚Äîa pledge which Burberry has already acted upon. According to the newly-released report, the fashion giant will ensure that all of its future plastic packaging is either reusable, recyclable, or compostable.   By the end of 2019, Burberry also plans to give shoppers the opportunity to recycle their unwanted hangers in a take-back scheme.  The British company has already swapped plastic lamination on its retail bags and poly bags for garment covers, a move which has apparently reduced the use of 29 tons of plastic. And that's not at all, as Burberry‚Äîled by chief creative officer Riccardo Tisci‚Äîhas also joined forces with Renewable Energy 100, a global initiative made up of more than 100 businesses committed to renewable energy consumption. The brand's latest announcement further demonstrates Burberry's commitment to a more sustainable future, as the company banned fur and the burning of unsold goods back in September 2018.  Last year, the luxury fashion house graced the headlines after famously torching clothing, accessories and perfume worth ¬£28.6 million in a bid to protect the brand from counterfeiters. After widespread criticism, Burberry pledged to reuse, upcycle, donate or recycle all unsaleable products in the future.

 From $200,000 dresses to caviar in your dressing room, Christine Chiu gives BAZAAR.com a rare glimpse into the extravagant world of women who jostle with celebrities‚Äîand each other‚Äîto buy Haute Couture. As I enter the Dior headquarters on an unusually hot Paris morning, the first thing I notice is several private pastry chefs baking fresh croissants and tarte tatins. Outside, tables are set with Dior homewares, a make-your-own flower bouquet booth (peonies! dahlias! cherry blossoms!), next to an elaborate set-up for a portrait photo shoot. Everyone waltzing around the pristine maison is dressed in head-to-toe Dior.  I‚Äôm following behind Christine Chiu, a multi-hyphenate Los Angeles dweller who splits her attention between Beverly Hills Plastic Surgery (the practice she founded with her husband, Dr. Gabriel Chiu), philanthropy, and an ambitious social life. Her Dior sales rep from Beverly Hills, who is leading the way, notes that a private room has been booked for the next 90 minutes. But Christine will need to complete her purchase in 30 minutes or less. The Chanel show is only two hours away, and she‚Äôll need to go back to the hotel to change. She already has an idea of the Dior looks that she wants‚Äîthe full lace catsuit (look 6), a strapless gown with leather fringe skirt (look 9), and a couple of lace dresses (looks 35 and 44)‚Äîbut first we‚Äôre led downstairs to see Dior‚Äôs high jewelry collection, an organized-by-color spectacle of emeralds, rubies, sapphires, and diamonds. The dark room amplifies the spotlights on each jewelry podium: Everything sparkles in their velvet trays, with several silver star stickers identifying the dozens of pieces that have already been spoken for. Christine selects four pieces to try on, two rings and two pairs of earrings, with prices ranging from ‚Ç¨160,000 to ‚Ç¨200,000 per piece. We‚Äôre quickly led to the room that houses all 65 Christian Dior Haute Couture looks from the Fall 2019 show that debuted just a day earlier. I hear prices being called out from the fitting room. They range up to ‚Ç¨200,000. The buying of Haute Couture is now a competitive sport, according to Christine, with each fashion house enforcing strict rules (which vary depending on designer) around how they sell their Haute Couture pieces. Some will only sell one dress per country or per territory‚Äîmeaning as soon as a designer takes their bow at the end of the show, Christine is already texting the brand's sales rep about the looks she wants for the season. If she's not fast enough and a look has already been snapped up by a U.S. client that Christine had set her sights on, she‚Äôll offer to buy as a Taiwanese client (she also has a home there), and promises the brand she‚Äôll only wear it for events in her native country.  However, when it comes to Hollywood, A-listers always get first dibs‚Äîeven if they're not technically buying it. When Celine Dion planned to wear the same couture dress as Christine to the Alexandre Vauthier show, the brand alerted Christine and asked her to wear something else to avoid a faux pas. Demi Moore was also the first person to debut a tuxedo-inspired Chanel Haute Couture gown that Christine had already purchased, in the October 2019 issue of Harper's Bazaar. "For red carpet appearances the brand will always give us a heads up," Christine explains, but that may not always be the case for editorial placements.  At Dior, look 65 catches her eye. It‚Äôs not your average couture gown‚Äîit‚Äôs a box shaped as a castle, the final look from the show. ‚ÄúIs that for sale? How much for that? I want it!‚Äù Christine asks with excitement. The Dior sales rep will be in touch. Christine is tiny enough to fit into the runway samples with ample room, but a seamstress is on hand to ensure each measurement is just right, and after 30 minutes‚Äîand a projected six-figure price tag‚Äîwe head back to the iconic Plaza Athenee Hotel, one of the most luxurious and undoubtedly the most expensive places to rest your head in Paris, to get ready for Chanel. This entails a brand new outfit, new hair, and makeup. On the first day of the Haute Couture shows, I meet Christine at her hotel as soon as she touches down in Paris. Her room, the presidential suite, isn't ready for her yet, and her Valentino fitting is looming. Still dressed in her clothes from the flight‚Äîcitron floral silk pajama pants and a matching floor-length robe‚Äîshe is teetering on platforms with a full face of makeup, lashes included, as she takes a minute to deliberate what to do with the small Louis Vuitton monogram suitcase at her feet. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs filled with all my jewelry,‚Äù she tells me. She‚Äôs afraid of it being stolen.  Over the next few days, it‚Äôs evident that security is constantly on Christine‚Äôs mind. ‚ÄúWhat if someone bombs the shows? Could you imagine? A lot of them don‚Äôt have high security,‚Äù she says anxiously on our first day together. This is not a woman who travels light, or cheaply, so she often double books her own airport assistance to get through customs, and her own car service‚Äîeven if a brand also offers to book one for her. During lunch at Caviar Kaspia with Piaget, Christine and her close friends recall a recent robbery of an acquaintance at a private airport in Paris. ‚ÄúIt was an inside job,‚Äù one of them reveals, as they look at each other nervously, wondering who could be next.  Personal security isn‚Äôt the only thing on Christine‚Äôs mind. She‚Äôs also anxious about her wardrobe options for the shows this season. ‚ÄúHaute Couture is like a project you work on year-long,‚Äù she explains. ‚ÄúYou have a million fittings to get these pieces exactly as you want them and then you debut them at the show.‚Äù Such is not the case this week, as she missed the last year of shows due to her pregnancy and birth of her first son, Gabriel, or ‚ÄúBaby G‚Äù as she often calls him. Several fashion houses offered to create pregnancy couture for her, but she only accepted one offer from Armani Prive, which hosted her Malibu baby shower. ‚ÄúI know it sounds superficial,‚Äù she admits about her worries over her fashion week outfit choices. But Christine, a major player in the high stakes game of Haute Couture, is used to wearing clothes that no one in the same country‚Äîor maybe even continent‚Äîcould ever wear.  Armani has really invested in me and our relationship, so I spend a lot of money with them. Back in Paris, Christine still needs something to wear for the Valentino show, so we head to the atelier to look at samples. ‚ÄúWhere is Dr. Chiu?‚Äù Valentino‚Äôs sales rep asks after greeting us. Dr. Gabriel Chiu, who usually accompanies his wife on these lavish trips, decided to skip out and stay at home with Baby G this week. Now I‚Äôm Christine‚Äôs plus one. We're quickly led into a private room, where a rack already set up with clothing options awaits: Three  dresses, plus a blouse and pant look from the Fall 2018 Haute Couture collection, hang pristinely. The Valentino rep also pulls runway photos of each look so Christine can see how they looked on models walking the show. Christine turns to me for my opinion, and I‚Äôm not afraid to share it‚ÄîI am a fashion editor after all‚Äîand I hone in on the standout teal silk gown with a gold neck adornment that also comes with a red taffeta jacket (look 58). After the seamstress and everyone else in the room gushes over this choice, Christine decides it‚Äôs not even worth trying on the other pieces. Considering the price tag, she is surprisingly decisive. The seamstress immediately gets to work pinning the dress for its shorter hem, noting there‚Äôs not much time for major alterations. Like a true fashion fan, Christine inquires about the inspiration and meaning behind the gown she‚Äôs about to purchase. The Valentino rep shares that the dress is inspired by Picasso. Christine hands over her credit card for the dress she will wear to the Valentino show in two days; although it‚Äôs a runway sample, it‚Äôs still Haute Couture, so there‚Äôs only a small discount. When I ask Christine if she has a budget for the week, she doesn‚Äôt hesitate before replying, ‚ÄúNo, but I have to pace myself‚Äù.  Back in the car, she gives me the rundown on what she‚Äôs been up to lately. There was the ‚ÄúOnce Upon a Time‚Äù premiere at Cannes, the amfAR Gala, not to mention she and her husband just finished building The Prince‚Äôs Foundation Chiu Integrated Health Programme, a health and wellness center in Scotland with Prince Charles. They even named a wing after their only son. Baby G‚Äôs first birthday party in June also resulted in a million-dollar donation to the Cayton Children‚Äôs Museum in Los Angeles. And last but not least, Christine is about to start filming tomorrow for an unscripted Crazy Rich Asians-inspired show, which she is also producing. For our busy week ahead, Christine is most excited for the Armani Prive and Alexandre Vauthier shows. ‚ÄúArmani has really invested in me and our relationship, so I spend a lot of money with them,‚Äù she reveals. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve worked to cultivate the relationship.‚Äù It‚Äôs clear that the houses that go above and beyond for her are the ones she feels inclined to spend more money on. As for Vauthier, ‚Äúhis designs are young and sexy, they‚Äôre most in-line with my personal style. I like to look sexy,‚Äù she says.   The following day is a busy one; there are four major shows and I attend most of them as an editor, but coordinate to meet up with Christine after the last show of the day: Givenchy. She was feeling a little concerned about timing for the evening; she had the Armani Prive client show at 7 p.m. with a private dinner following, and Givenchy at 8 p.m. She felt it would be rude to show up so late because fashion houses, she says, have certain expectations of their clients. However, she couldn‚Äôt not go to Givenchy, so she did what any smart fashionista would do: Changed in the car from her Givenchy look back into her Armani look for the dinner to maximize time. It suddenly occurred to me that I was extremely underdressed for dinner. I hadn‚Äôt had a moment to get back to my hotel to change all day and was dressed in a yellow floral sundress, while Christine was in couture.  ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you try on my Givenchy gown?‚Äù she casually suggests. Though I knew there was no way it would fit, I appreciated that she was generous enough to offer such a special dress to me. When I arrived at the dinner, wearing a little black dress that could pass as appropriate for a dinner with Giorgio Armani, I passed tables seating the likes of Nicole Kidman and husband Keith Urban, and Aleksander Skarsgard, until I found Christine next to a marketing executive at Giorgio Armani. The two had never met before, but he is very aware of exactly who Christine is: The brand hosted an elaborate baby shower for her last year at Soho House's new Malibu location.   The following day, I meet Christine (and her TV camera crew) after Jean Paul Gaultier. The clothes were bold and full of fantasy‚Äîabsolute eye candy‚Äîand the booming early ‚Äò90s dance music made it feel like a party (or maybe that was the champagne and Magnum ice cream bars they handed out beforehand). I couldn‚Äôt wait to get her opinion. During each show, I often found myself trying to pick out the pieces that I thought she would like. For Gaultier, it'd be look 15 or look 19, for an apr√®s ski scenario, or look 53 for her next engagement at Buckingham Palace. ‚ÄúWell, leopard is my neutrals so I loved it,‚Äù she tells me reflecting on the show while we‚Äôre stuck in traffic. ‚ÄúNormally I wouldn‚Äôt wear the same dress twice, I still have so much couture I haven‚Äôt worn yet!‚Äù she says referring to her current Grecian-inspired mini dress by Jean Paul Gaultier. ‚ÄúBut I did wear this dress for the Oscars afterparties this year.‚Äù  Where does she actually keep all of these clothes? ‚ÄúWell, our Beverly Hills home used to belong to Kimora Lee Simons,‚Äù she says by way of explanation. ‚ÄúWe ripped the whole house down and redid it, but I kept the bones of her closet. It spans the entire length of the house. In my old house, there were little rooms inside my closet that were temperature and humidity-controlled to make sure it was the best environment for my clothes,‚Äù she adds. However the brands also take responsibility for helping her keep her couture in pristine shape. ‚ÄúMost of the houses will take back your pieces after you‚Äôve worn them and restore it for you, if you got a stain on it or an embellishment has fallen off. It‚Äôs like a little spa treatment.‚Äù  And how does a couture client like Christine Chiu make a decision on what to add to her already overflowing wardrobe? ‚ÄúSometimes like with the Armani show, when there‚Äôs so many looks that I love, the first process of elimination is if it overlaps with any other pieces I‚Äôm potentially buying. Then it‚Äôs the price. If it‚Äôs an insane price (like a seven-figure range), I consider whether I would rather get three dresses or one spectacular dress.‚Äù Christine also considers the craftsmanship of her purchases. ‚ÄúI think about how much the material costs, how hard it is to make, the effort that has gone into it. Everyone has their own evaluation,‚Äù she explains. ‚ÄúSometimes there‚Äôs no logical reason behind it, you just fall in love and the price doesn‚Äôt matter.‚Äù  You just fall in love and the price doesn‚Äôt matter. The next day we‚Äôre off to Rome for the final Haute Couture show of the week: Fendi, a true spectacle, staged at the Temple of Venus, which the fashion house is making a pledge to restore. About 600 friends and fans of the brand were present, with a perfect view of the Coliseum to see Silvia Venturini Fendi's first solo couture collection since the passing of Karl Lagerfeld. Christine‚Äôs Fendi sales rep meets us as soon as we arrive to escort us up to her seat. The invitation made note that guests should wear ‚Äúsensible‚Äù shoes, so although Christine is dressed up in a body-hugging fur cocktail dress and matching platform stilettos, she is also toting around white leather Hermes sandals. When the show is over, the Fendi sales rep finds us again to put us in a golf-cart, which takes us to an equally stunning dinner location nearby. After dinner, dessert, and a performance by Lion Babe, we‚Äôre ready to call it a night‚Äîtwo handsome suit-clad escorts help us down the dark, rocky hill to get into her private car.  At the Fendi fitting the following afternoon, I‚Äôm excited to see what Christine will order after seeing the ‚Äò70s-inspired collection.  ‚ÄúI want to get pieces that when you look at them, you‚Äôre like ‚ÄòOh, that was the one standout look from that show,‚Äô‚Äù she notes. Christine likens her Haute Couture purchases to collecting art, although she says her husband has suggested she focus more of their funds on high jewelry‚Äîsince jewelry typically holds its value. Christine, who has been a couture client for nearly a decade, often reminisces on the earlier days of Haute Couture shopping. ‚ÄúThere was a romance about it,‚Äù she says as she describes the more ‚Äúcivilized‚Äù days. ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt feel like you were competing against anyone else. The designers would be present during your buy, they would share their favorite pieces, or recommend what look you should buy. I loved being able to get into the head of the designer, his journey, and understanding how the collection was a manifestation of that journey,‚Äù she explains. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôd give you a folder of sketches from the collection, and you were presented with swatches of fabric they used that season. I really miss that side of Haute Couture. Honestly, you end up buying more, you appreciate it beyond just the face value, beyond the prettiness...‚Äù Sometimes designers would even take the clients to lunch. The feeling of being courted by a brand and bonding with the designer is what Christine really misses. But despite the lack of romancing, she says she still feels obligated to buy each season, for every show that she attends, even if she‚Äôs not really feeling the collection.  At the Fendi headquarters, we‚Äôre immersed in the ‚ÄúDawn of Romanity,‚Äù the name of the collection and exhibition that will run for the next two weeks in Rome. There‚Äôs stations set up with multiple artisans working on pieces similar to what we viewed on the runway: From a table of exotic skins to make the Fendi Peekaboo bags to a hand-embroiderer sewing tiny tulle flowers onto a dress nearby. There‚Äôs another station that would send any animal rights activist into a tailspin: A table of furs for the house‚Äôs statement coats. (It‚Äôs the brand‚Äôs signature, so don‚Äôt expect any announcements about them going fur-free.) First, Christine goes through the couture clutches ranging from marble-print enamel to fur-covered, before making her way through the clothing. She has her eye on a floor-length fur coat, ‚Äúbut where would I wear it?‚Äù she asks, genuinely curious. After all, she is a California resident, which has strict rules about fur.   
 The Fendi sales rep takes pictures of everything that catches her eye until we‚Äôre escorted into a private dressing room. These aren‚Äôt your regular, dimly-lit and cramped dressing rooms; it‚Äôs more like a celebrity green room, with  a plush couch, ottomans, and marble coffee table which will soon be covered with a bottle of Ruinart champagne, small bites, and a bowl of caviar. ‚ÄúThis is probably a $1,000 worth of caviar,‚Äù Christine tells me, which she reveals also makes her feel compelled  to spend more with them since they‚Äôre obviously treating her.  She tries on a black dress with sheer panels. It‚Äôs reserved but still a bit sexy. ‚ÄúWhere would I wear this?‚Äù she asks with each look. Then there‚Äôs a fur jacket with an attached cape, ‚ÄúI could just wear this as a dress, is there a belt?‚Äù She pulls the coat tightly around her tiny waist. While the clothes she has already tried on are swapped out for another set (only three samples are allowed at a time in the dressing room), Christine looks over the line sheets with all the color options and pricing, as well as an iPad that shows each piece from the show. Then her dream sable coat arrives. ‚ÄúWhat color would I do this in?‚Äù The sample is black but there‚Äôs a range of other fur colors to choose from.  For once this week, Christine is not in a rush. There‚Äôs no time limits on her dressing room or constraints to her schedule. She takes her time enjoying the process, trying on clothes, taking photos and snapping boomerangs of herself in each look while sipping Champagne. It's the ultimate shopping experience. However, time is ticking for me, as I only have one free day left in Rome, so I decide it‚Äôs time to make my exit. ‚ÄúIs this the last time I‚Äôll see you?‚Äù asks my couture companion as she rises from the couch to hug me goodbye. I tell her I‚Äôm only a phone call away and to keep me posted on the purchases. That afternoon she texts me, ‚ÄúI got the big sexy black see-through gown btw, and the under-trimmings and clutch.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat about the fur cape dress?‚Äù I responded ‚ÄúUndecided‚Äîit‚Äôs difficult for California peta patrol‚Äî you can only wear fur in secret nowadays.‚Äù  After I spent the rest of my afternoon walking around the city, taking in the Pantheon and Trevi Fountain sights, eating pizza and tiramisu gelato, I return to my hotel to find a Fendi shopping bag waiting for me in my hotel room. A parting gift from Christine with a note... Dear Chrissy‚Äî these boots were made for Rome-ing... and you! Loved sharing Paris and Rome with you! Cheers for adventures ahead! xx Christine

 From the unforgettable runway shows to the standout models.  It was a year of statement-making runways, uplifting campaigns, and a few exciting firsts in the fashion industry. As 2017 comes to an end, take a look back at all the standout moments that defined the year in fashion.  Versace's Spring 2018 show paid tribute to the fashion house's late founder, Gianni Versace, 20 years after his tragic death. Along with a collection that brought back Gianni's most iconic designs, the special show reunited the original '90s supermodels on the runway. Naomi Campbell, Cindy Crawford, Claudia Schiffer, Carla Bruni, and Helena Christensen all walked hand-in-hand beside Donatella for an incredible finale walk‚Äîmaking for the greatest fashion week moment of the year.  On the heels of their big Oscar win, the cast of Moonlight landed their first-ever fashion campaign, starring in Calvin Klein Underwear's Spring 2017 ads. Mahershala Ali, Ashton Sanders, Trevante Rhodes, and Alex Hibbert all appeared in the black and white photos shot by Willy Vanderperre.  Once again, Rihanna showed up to the Met Gala schooling everyone on how to dress for a theme. The singer was one of the few attendees to actually adhere to the Rei Kawakuba avant-garde theme, wearing one of the designer's Fall 2016 looks (which was also featured in the Met exhibit). And let's not forget the lace-up heels that tied up her entire leg.  The year kicked off with the incredible Women's March that took place across the entire globe‚Äîand the fashion industry didn't sit the movement out. Showing solidarity, Missoni staged a pussy hat march of their own at Milan Fashion Week in February. Models wore Missoni's pink striped rendition of the iconic accessory for a powerful finale moment that was both uplifting and empowering.  Legendary designer Azzedine Ala√Øa passed away at the age of 77 in November, causing the industry to mourn the tragic loss. The revolutionary designer, oft known as the "king of cling," left a mark on the fashion world with his groundbreaking designs and is responsible for helping launch Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, and Cindy Crawford to international success. In July, he showed his final couture show after a six year hiatus, which Campbell opened.  The 16-year-old had a breakout season after making her runway debut at Calvin Klein during New York Fashion Week. Gerber went on to walk shows like Alexander Wang, Saint Laurent, Versace, Miu Miu, and Chanel in New York, London, Milan, and Paris, proving she's definitely inherited her supermodel mother's runway genes.  The award for best front row attendee of the year goes to Leslie Jones, who had the greatest time ever attending Christian Siriano's Spring 2018 show in September. The actress/comedian brought some serious fun to the typically quiet and stuffy front row scene. As Siriano's designs walked the runway, Jones cheered, clapped, and shouted things like "YASSS" and "YOU WORK, GIRL!" at the models. Invite her to every runway show from now on, please.   Our first official look at #PenelopeCruz as #DonatellaVersace has arrived! üòØüî• The Oscar winner stars in 'The Assassination of Gianni Versace,' the new installment of #RyanMurphy‚Äôs award-winning #AmericanCrimeStory franchise. Click the link in our bio for more details. üì∑: Alexei Hay for EW A post shared by Entertainment Weekly (@entertainmentweekly) on May 23, 2017 at 8:11am PDT American Crime Story announced its next season would be 'The Assassination of Gianni Versace,' recounting the events surrounding Gianni Versace's tragic 1997 murder. The series tapped none other than Penelope Cruz to star as Donatella Versace and the Oscar-winning actress is a dead-ringer for the designer in the first official photos. The series is set to debut in early 2018. Saint Laurent kicked off Paris Fashion Week's Spring 2018 collections with the most epic show venue: the Eiffel Tower. As models hit the runway, the iconic French monument lit up and sparkled in the background, making for a goosebumps-inducing moment.  When Twitter noticed the similarities between Balenciaga's $2,145 tote and Ikea's $0.99 cent take-home bag, everyone completely lost it. The hilarious Ikea vs. Balenciaga memes and tweets led to Ikea trolling the fashion house with a cheeky print campaign titled, "How to identify an original Ikea Frakta bag." When Gigi Hadid suffered a wardrobe malfunction at Anna Sui's Spring 2018 show (the model somehow lost one of her shoes), her sister Bella was there to lend a helping hand‚Äîliterally‚Äîand helped her walk down the runway for the finale. It was an adorably rare Hadid sister moment on the runway that, naturally, flooded social media.  For the second time in its 45-year history, Pirelli cast an all-black cast for its annual calendar. Starring Duckie Thot, Naomi Campbell, Diddy, Whoopi Goldberg, Thando Hopa, Lupita Nyong'o, and more, the Alice in Wonderland-themed calendar shot by Tim Walker celebrated black talent with a whimsical, empowering shoot.  2017 was a year of wins for Ashley Graham, but the model made major strides at New York Fashion Week, where she became the first plus-size model to walk a Michael Kors show.  Reigning as 2017's most surprising breakout style star, C√©line Dion had a year full of LEWKS. With the help of new stylist Law Roach, Dion's wardrobe transformed into that of a risk-taking, high fashion chameleon. From the street style scene to Paris Couture Week to her first ever Met Gala, Dion churned out look after look‚Äîleaving us all waiting for the next one.  Rihanna returned to New York Fashion Week with a bang after two seasons of showing in Paris. For her Fenty x Puma Spring 2018 show (which started with stunt men flying over the runway on dirtbikes), the singer-turned-designer took her final bow on the back of a motorbike, cementing her status as the ultimate bad gal.  Making her New York Fashion Week debut, Gloria Steinem attended her first ever fashion show at the age of 83. The feminist icon picked a fitting runway for her first and attended Prabal Gurung's Spring 2018 show, which celebrated diversity and feminism. She even shared the moment on Instagram writing, "There is a first time for everything, even at 83! First #nyfw show @prabalgurung, a kind man doing great work in fashion and beyond." Everyone's obsession with Stranger Things hit the runway at Louis Vuitton's Spring 2018 collection. The French fashion house sent t-shirts emblazoned with the Netflix show down the runway, making for the ultimate cultural mashup.  From Vetements x Levi's butt jeans to the introduction of thong jeans at Tokyo Fashion Week, it was a roller coaster of a year for denim. Brands tried just about every jean innovation and deconstruction known to mankind‚Äînone of which have (thankfully) managed to stick yet. Also giving classic blue jeans a makeover were Opening Ceremony's detachable jeans, Bella Hadid's denim skirt over jeans, and Topshop's completely clear plastic jeans. Perhaps it's best to keep things classic in 2018. Walking L'Oreal Paris's first ever runway show at Paris Fashion Week, Jane Fonda and Helen Mirren (79 and 72 years old respectively), made their catwalk debut‚Äîand it was epic. Each of the legendary actresses brought their own sass and strut to the runway, looking completely incredible while doing so.   Honoring the twentieth anniversary of Princess Diana's tragic death, Off-White designer Virgil Abloh decided to take inspiration from the late royal style icon for his Spring 2018 collection in September. From tartan day suits to polka dots and strong shouldered silhouettes, the designer reinterpreted Diana's most memorable looks for the 2017 woman. The end result was a touching nod to the late Princess.  After over a year of monitoring Meghan Markle's style and blossoming relationship with Prince Harry, the couple announced their engagement last month‚Äìgiving us all a new royal style star to follow. Markle made her first appearance as an engaged woman in a white robe coat, emerald dress, and nude pumps.  The latest luxury brand to halt the use of real fur, Gucci announced its joining of the Fur Free Alliance in October. Following in the anti-fur footsteps of Stella McCartney, Giorgio Armani, Hugo Boss, and Net-A-Porter, Gucci's impact on not only the Kering group but the luxury fashion industry in general indicates it's probably just the first of many more brands to finally go fur-free.  Up against Bella Hadid, Gigi Hadid, Winnie Harlow, and newcomer Kaia Gerber, Adwoah Aboah took home the award for Model of The Year at the 2017 Fashion Awards after a breakout year of runways, campaigns, and more. 
 The model's look is still available to shop‚Äîand it's affordable.  Fashion has a new favorite color and Irina Shayk is the latest to embrace it. While vacationing in Florence, the model stepped out in pistachio green‚Äîthe color taking over both Instagram and just about every celebrity look as of late.  The shirred mini dress by Faithfull the Brand, which is still available to shop for $210, has been popping up on just about every cool girl on Instagram. The model opted to pair hers with sporty dad sneakers, a lime green bag, and a sideways cross necklace.  Tapping into both the milkmaid dress trend and the latest It color, Shayk's look simultaneously nailed two of Summer 2019's hottest trends. Earlier this week, ELLE.com declared shades of pistachio and lime green the "new millennial pink." And from Rihanna to influencers like Alyssa Coscarelli, the style set seems to unanimously agree.    Pistachio green has been taking over A-listers and fashion influencers in every form‚Äîfrom playful dresses to handbags, sandals, and full monochromatic looks.    last night headed to preview the CHARLES & KEITH's Fall 2019 collection at the Singapore Night Marketüíö see more on my stories @CHARLESKEITHofficial #ImwithCHARLESKEITH #sponsored A post shared by  alyssa coscarelli (@alyssainthecity) on Jun 12, 2019 at 5:14am PDT  Back in nyc ‚ù§Ô∏è (wearing my @chimieyewear frame in ‚Äújust red‚Äù) A post shared by  elsa hosk (@hoskelsa) on May 28, 2019 at 7:04am PDT  Ivy Dress A post shared by  S T A U D (@staud.clothing) on Apr 22, 2019 at 2:58pm PDT  Loving every part of Italy. ‚ù§Ô∏è A post shared by  Negin Mirsalehi (@negin_mirsalehi) on May 23, 2019 at 6:04am PDT  Ibiza Day 1: Girls in #JARDIN #faithfulltravels A post shared by  Faithfull the Brand (@faithfullthebrand) on May 20, 2019 at 10:22pm PDT  Muse @maria_bernad with our Tea skirt üíö #Musiermuse A post shared by  Musier Paris (@musierparis) on May 28, 2019 at 2:42am PDT  Shop some of summer's hottest pieces in the new green of the moment. 
 "I'm hot in every sense of the word," the rapper told WWD.  Eighty degree weather be damned: it's New York Fashion Week and if Nicki Minaj wants to wear a giant fur coat, she's going to wear a giant fur coat, okay? The rapper attended Oscar de la Renta's Spring 2018 show today in a hooded black and white fur coat by the brand. You mere peasants may see the 78 degree forecast in New York and think "I don't even need to wear a jacket today!" but let Nicki teach you a little something: you ALWAYS need a fur coat. Arriving at the show, the rapper posed for photos‚Äîshowing off all her best angles as the crowd shouted "YASSSSSS Nicki, she DID that!!!!'  She really DID do that. 
 The MOB wore green for her daughter's wedding... Sarah Ferguson, widely referred to as Fergie and today as Mother of the Bride, arrived to her daughter Princess Eugenie's wedding in a perfectly tailored green dress. The long sleeve, short length dress is ultra-flattering thanks to its wrap detail, finished with a satin lapel. It was designed by Emma Louise, a local Ascot designer. For a little added flair, the dress has a subdued train, which whipped up delightfully on this windy London day.    She paired the dress with a show-stopping wide-brim green hat to match, complete with a gilded bow, designed by milliner Jess Collett. Twitter is full of references to Fergie taking flight thanks to that major bow and Storm Callum in full effect. Fergie looks like she has wings and might take off at any moment #RoyalWedding pic.twitter.com/BDoDGHCnMP The star jewelry piece in her ensemble is a pair of emerald and diamond drop earrings, which mirror the stunning emerald and diamond crown her daughter Eugenie donned down the aisle. Ferguson also wore the brown leather clutch bag that her own mother carried when she wed Prince Andrew at her own royal wedding in 1986. Her slingback embossed leather heels coordinate with her bag. Alas, Fergie's own marriage was not to last. She and Prince Andrew dated for one year before marrying in the mid-1980s and divorced in 1996, after a decade of marriage. The two remained successful co-parents to their daughters Eugenie and Beatrice and reportedly still live together.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in and out all the time, and he‚Äôs in and out all the time,‚Äù Fergie said in an interview in 2016 for an Australian radio show, according to People.com. ‚ÄúAnd no, we‚Äôre not married. We‚Äôre very happy with the way things are.‚Äù But back to that look, it's a standout Mother of the Bride moment, classic and well-tailored with just the right amount of nostalgia. But more than that, Fergie looks utterly thrilled to be there. 
 There she goes! Gigi Hadid has returned to the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show for the first time since 2016. The 23-year-old runway star joins models like her sister Bella, bestie Kendall Jenner, and Angels like Adriana Lima, Josephine Skriver, and Elsa Hosk for this year's show in NYC, which was taped today. Photos are still trickling in on social media, but according to videos posted by guests, one of Hadid's runway looks involves a massive printed parachute instead of wings. 
  In the video, Gigi struts down the catwalk, holding down the billowing parachute with a pair of straps that hang down at her shoulders. Along with the flowing accessory, she sports a matching pink floral ensemble: A cropped long-sleeve top, leggings, and coordinating booties.  For another runway look, Hadid wore a plaid outfit with mixed prints, an asymmetrical puff sleeve, and lace-up thigh-high boots.  This marks Gigi's third Victoria's Secret Fashion Show since first in 2015. Although she was initially expected to walk last year's runway in Shanghai, she unexpectedly pulled out ahead of filming. She announced in a tweet last November, "I‚Äôm so bummed I won‚Äôt be able to make it to China this year. Love my VS family, and will be with all my girls in spirit!! Can't wait to tune in with everyone to see the beautiful show I know it will be, and already can't wait for next year!" However, her younger sister, Bella, did walk in Shanghai, and Gigi congratulated her from afar. This year, the sisters finally reunited on the VS runway, and you can watch Bella's walk right here.  Watch Gigi and Bella (and all of the other models) walk the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show when the broadcast airs on Sunday, December 2 on ABC. Find Out Where to Watch This post has been updated.

 Nicolas Ghesqui√®re is keeping this show a little closer to home... No stranger to globe-trotting, Louis Vuitton's creative director Nicolas Ghesqui√®re has brought the French fashion house all around the world to debut new collections. Just last year, to present the Louis Vuitton's Resort 2018 line, he staged a breathtaking runway display on an architecturally-modern suspension bridge at Miho Museum (designed by I.M. Pei ) in Kyoto, Japan. Since then, fans of fashion house have been anxiously waiting to learn where Ghesqui√®re will head next. As it turns out, the location for Louis Vuitton's 2019 Resort collection‚Äîjust announced today‚Äîdoes not disappoint. Staying true to the brand's Parisian roots, Ghesqui√®re's next itinerant fashion show will take place within the borders of Vuitton's home country, in the classic and picturesque French Riviera. The presentation is scheduled for May 30, 2018, WWD reports. The exact location of the runway show has yet to be revealed, but will be made public by Ghesqui√®re "at a later date." Though the architecture, runway structure, and of course, the designs themselves all remain unknown, the chic Mediterranean seaside‚Äîwhich has become a go-to vacation destination for the rich and famous‚Äîwill prove a stunningly scenic backdrop for any designer's resort collection. In addition to last year's mountaintop moment in Kyoto, Ghesqui√®re's previous wanderlust-worthy destinatoins include Rio de Janeiro for the Resort 2017 range, Palm Springs for 2016, and Monaco for 2015. Suffice it to say, we're eager to see what the designer has up his sleeve for Vuitton this time around‚Äîespecially with the home-court advantage. But before he heads to the French Riviera, he'll be stopping in the French capital for Paris Fashion Week to unveil the brand's Fall 2018 range on Tuesday, March 6.

 The change is effective at the end of the month. Coach Inc. is changing its name to Tapestry to better incorporate all of the brands it owns, which includes Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman. The name change becomes official at the end of the month. Tapestry already has its own website up and running.  The new moniker "is more inclusive," according to Victor Luis, CEO of the New York-based label. "We are now at a defining moment in our corporate reinvention, having evolved from a mono-brand specialty retailer to a true house of emotional, desirable brands," he said in a statement. The change is part of Coach's pursuit of younger shoppers who may not feel the same draw to store windows on Manhattan's 5th Avenue. Coach was established as a small workshop in Manhattan in 1941, and flourished as a fashion powerhouse in the early 1960s. The leatherwear brand acquired Stuart Weitzman in 2015 and Kate Spade in 2017.  Associated Press contributed reporting.

 The iconic staple looks so right in 2017 There‚Äôs no denying the extreme ‚Äò90s presence that has crept into every aspect of this summer‚Äôs fashion, with brands like Tommy Hilfiger and Vetements each playing their respective parts to renew some serious denim and normcore throwbacks. But one of the biggest sartorial successes of the ‚Äò90s, and the summer of 2017, is the slinky, sexy slip dress. Decades ago, it was made popular by designers like Calvin Klein and Narciso Rodriguez, who famously dressed every big name super model, along with Carolyn Bessette on her wedding day‚Äîwhich is should be the first image that comes up if you Google ‚Äúslip dress.‚Äù Here, we provide endless inspiration for you to style your 2017 versions from the fashion icons who did it best.

 Forget basic black‚Äîthis winter, it‚Äôs all about color and volume. It can be so easy to fall into a wardrobe rut as temperatures drop. But resist the urge to rely on safe staples and muted colors, and instead, swap out some of that black and gray for hues that are much brighter and a lot more playful.  Max Mara‚Äôs Teddy Bear coat‚Äîreimagined this season in five exciting colors‚Äîis the outerwear staple your closet needs now. Ahead, how to style the coziest coat you‚Äôll ever own. Dress down the bright yellow coat with a pair of easy vintage jeans and a white button-up. The casual outfit allows your outerwear to have its own moment without feeling too extra. Keep that same laid-back attitude by finishing off with a pair of sneakers.  This powerful, royal blue hue is a strong statement on its own. Let it stand out by pairing it with a classic New York City look: head-to-toe black. For a super soft effect, wear the ivory Teddy with pieces in the same color family to nail one of this season‚Äôs big trends: tonal dressing. Here, it‚Äôs worn with a combination of creamy beige, taupe, and camel pieces that create one seamless, chic look. Play down the vibrancy of a coral coat with flat boots and neutrals like a textured gray skirt and white top. Pair it all with black tights for an outfit that looks‚Äîand feels‚Äîincredibly warm. Winter whites have nothing on full-body turquoise. Add a jolt of fresh color into your wardrobe by going all-out with a monochromatic look in a very bold hue‚Äîaccessories included.

 Things got lit at Gucci's latest show.  Keeping up with this season's trend of presenting resort shows in France (Dior and Louis Vuitton each staged runways in Paris and the French Riviera earlier this week), Gucci headed to Arles, France, for its Cruise 2019 collection last night. Opting for yet another unconventional runway setting, the Italian fashion house staged its latest show at the Promenade Des Alyscamps in Arles‚Äîan ancient Roman cemetery that was lit up by candelabras and actual fire lining the runway. For the collection, creative director Alessandro Michele was "fascinated by the idea of death," and really who isn't in the Year of Our Lord 2018? The eerily haunted runway setting served as the perfect backdrop for a collection filled with an abundance of cross necklaces and Victorian dresses. For the finale, a Gucci bride donning a white, high-collared Victorian gown and gothic cross walked dangerously close to the fire-lined runway whilst carrying a bouquet of pink peonies.  The rest of the collection, which was comprised of an astounding 114 looks, included a range of Guccified pieces like an ornate velvet cape, neon lace tights, goth accents, and prints galore.  Another standout detail was an ossuary-inspired look that added ornate detailing to a rib cage-embroidered dress.  "The inspiration is an ossuary, the crypts of the cardinals, of the monks in the 15th century, and the precious decorations. This idea is that everything that is linked to the afterlife is accompanied by something of maximum beauty,‚Äù Michele wrote on Instagram.  Though this Gucci show didn't include any human heads or baby dragons, the flame-filled runways and creepy, death-inspired undertones were still enough to capture our attention regardless.
 The brand went especially French for its trip to Paris Fashion Week.  There were no human heads or baby dragons at Gucci this season, but Alessandro Michele still had a few theatrical tricks up his ruffled sleeve. First off, the brand's Spring 2019 show didn't take place in its usual homebase of Milan, but instead at Paris's historic Le Palace theater. And to really go full-on Parisian, the show featured a surprise "intermission" performance by none other than French icon herself, Jane Birkin.  The 71-year-old singer and actress emerged from her front row seat to sing ‚ÄúBaby Alone in Babylone‚Äù for the room of Gucci showgoers.  The especially French moment ended with Alessandro Michele thanking and hugging Birkin during his final bow.  Gucci's runway event, which marked the brand's first and only Paris Fashion Week show, was the final in its three-part homage to France (which also included its Pre-Fall 2018 campaign and Cruise 2019 show staged in Arles, France). As for the collection itself, the looks were an eclectic mashup of decades and cultures, all of which came together at Paris's historic nightclub-turned-theater. This season included references from the 1930s to the '70s and '80s along with nods to not only France, but also Gucci's Italian roots and some Americana (in the form of a Disney collaboration that included Mickey Mouse handbags).  And along with Birkin, Gucci also paid homage to some other legendary female musicians in its Spring 2019 collection. Felted hats inspired by Janis Joplin and a denim jacket airbrushed with a portrait of Dolly Parton both hit the runway as part of the brand's spring range.

 An exclusive first look at Jack Rogers's collectible sandals.  Jackie Kennedy's style may be synonymous with elegant eveningwear and that infamous pink suit, but the former First Lady also had an undeniable knack for vacation attire.  From summers in Hyannis Port to coasting Capri, Jackie had a way of making even the most laidback and effortless of looks glamorous. During one of her trips to Capri, she fell in love with a pair of flat leather sandals that not only became a staple for her vacation style, but also birthed a new brand when she returned to the U.S.: Jack Rogers.  Jack sandals, $118, SHOP She loved the sandal so much that upon her return to the states, she brought them to a cobbler in Palm Beach, Florida to create additional pairs‚Äîand so was the start of the Jack Rogers shoe brand. Fast forward to over 50 years later and the Jackie O-inspired sandals are still the core component of the brand's ethos‚Äîand just as timeless as ever.  Now, to commemorate Jackie O's influence, the brand is giving the former First Lady's iconic sandal a colorful revamp with a limited-edition capsule collection. Set to launch on the 15th of every month throughout 2018, the full collection will include 36 different styles, each hand-numbered and produced in limited quantities‚Äîmaking for the perfect collectible for any Jackie O. fan.  Jack sandals, $128, SHOP ‚ÄúOur Collector‚Äôs Edition Jacks capsule is a celebration of the rich history of the brand made famous by Jackie O over 50 years ago. In designing the hand numbered collection, we drew inspiration from vintage Jacks and referenced the archives to curate this truly unique collection," Bridget Bali, Director of Merchandising at Jack Rogers, said.  From vibrant color combinations to metallic hues, the capsule will roll out three new styles each month‚Äîall of which will retail for $128. And further proving the timelessness of Jackie Kennedy's style, the leather sandals feel just as stylish now as they did in the 1960s.  Jack Rogers sandals, all $128, available starting January 15 on jackrogersusa.com. 
 This is the music icon's first fashion campaign. It's been 20 years since Ms. Lauryn Hill dropped her iconic debut album, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. To celebrate, the legendary singer has put on pop-up performances,  embarked on a major world tour, and thanks to Woolrich, nabbed a starring role in a fashion campaign for the first time in her career.  Titled Woolrich: American Soul Since 1830, the campaign shines a spotlight on "artists whose creative ingenuity is at the very heart of American culture." It follows Ms. Lauryn Hill throughout the streets of Harlem, which is also where she shot the video for her 1998 single "Doo Wop."  In addition to posing in front of the camera, Ms. Lauryn Hill also worked behind the scenes co-creating an exclusive capsule collection that features Woolrich's classic outerwear styles reworked into Lauryn Hill-approved designs. Shot and filmed by Jack Davidson, the singer makes her way to the famed Apollo Theater where she performs a live rendition of her single "Ex-Factor" while wearing the Arctic Parka (with a black and white portrait of herself printed on the back) and the Silverton Coat featuring Woolrich's trademark buffalo check.   "The opportunity to work with Ms. Hill was the perfect start to our ongoing ‚ÄòAmerican Soul‚Äô project, highlighting Woolrich‚Äôs American heritage," Andrea Can√®, creative director of Woolrich said in a press release. "We wanted Ms. Hill to bring her unique artistic eye to the product and DNA of the brand so we invited her to put her own spin on these classic Woolrich styles, reflecting her interpretation of ‚ÄòAmerican Soul.‚Äô ‚Äù

 The brand's artistic director Julie de Libran breaks down the whimsical new collection, Manifesto.  As Sonia Rykiel celebrates 50 years, of the house has introduced a new capsule collection, Manifesto. The idea of the collection comes from Madame Rykiel‚Äôs Dictionnaire D√©glingu√©‚Äîfull of quirky, literary wordplay and double meanings. The clothes themselves reflect this, with each piece being dedicated to a specific word that incorporates "SR" highlighted in red lettering. Here, Sonia Rykiel‚Äôs artistic director Julie de Libran talks about the new collection and how she embraced the Parisian label‚Äôs whimsical past to create something for the present. I‚Äôve always loved Madame Rykiel‚Äôs Dictionnaire D√©glingu√©, her dictionary that‚Äôs filled with wonderful definitions like ‚ÄúRomantic: A woman in a man‚Äôs suit, with a flower in her hair.‚Äù It demonstrates an intense joy in its wordplay and in its wit and lightheartedness. So it was only natural to launch a year of celebrations for the 50th anniversary of the house with a Manifesto capsule collection themed around a Sonia Rykiel vocabulary. The first word I chose was ‚Äús‚Äôaimer,‚Äù to love oneself. At the risk of sounding clich√©d, it seemed pertinent in a world where there is so much insecurity and unhappiness. I wrote s‚Äôaimer boldly across the front of a boyfriend sweater, giving a nod to our monogram with the ‚ÄúS‚Äù and ‚ÄúR‚Äù falling on the sleeves. Sonia Rykiel dress, $1,080, soniarykiel.com; Sonia Rykiel sweater, $720, soniarykiel.com.  The Sauternes dress is shaped like a bottle of the sweet French wine. It‚Äôs quietly witty‚Äîand so easy to wear! Sonia Rykiel was one of the first true ready-to-wear designers. She wanted women to be free to show off their bodies with pride but also to be able to move around with ease. She combined deep intelligence and reflection with free-spirited fun. My other style icons are Miuccia Prada, Sofia Coppola, and my mother. They each have an individual style that has character, and they aren‚Äôt influenced by others. I always start the day with yoga. I like going to Le Tigre on Rue de Cherche-Midi for Iyengar yoga, which you practice with a chair. A men‚Äôs blue or camel blazer, a black mock turtleneck knit, black jeans, and stilettos are my workday uniform. I feel stronger when I wear heels. They also give a nice feminine counterpoint to my tailored jacket, which ends up on my shoulders because I don‚Äôt like to be cold.  Being in a calm place with music allows me to get lost in my creativity. My favorite artists are Violent Femmes and Supertramp. I need everything in my workspace hidden aside from my books. Martino Gamper made custom shelves for me with cubbies for all the technical office things like the printer and the coffee machine. I‚Äôm currently reading Elena Ferrante‚Äôs Neapolitan novels. (I‚Äôm on the third.) I love the story of this long relationship between two women. Their growing up takes them to different places and yet they remain so attached to each other. Tokyo never fails to excite me, as it always feels new and different but also ancient and established. Ugo Rondinone‚Äôs Seven Magic Mountains installation outside Las Vegas is on my travel bucket list. Timeless style means having a wardrobe of clothes that are versatile, of goodquality, and can be passed down through the generations. I have two of my mother‚Äôs Sonia Rykiel mohair cardigans from the 1970s, which I wear a lot. They are still infused with her perfume, or maybe I just want to believe that. Shoulder pads are a trend that needs to come back. But flip-flops need to die. Clothes shouldn‚Äôt overwhelm someone. They should make one feel more beautiful and give strength and joy. I love that Rykiel can offer both sport and soir√©e without it seeming contradictory. Which is the essence of the modern woman. Sonia Rykiel pouch, $190, soniarykiel.com; Sonia Rykiel tote, $550, soniarykiel.com. The cultural revolution in Paris demanded a rethink of the way women expressed themselves through their clothes. This is something the Manifesto collection speaks to, evoking the spirit of 1968. I like to think the Rykiel woman remains daring, stylish, witty, and free.
 There's no bad blood. For the past sixteen years, Bruno Frisoni has worked to breathe life and creative spirit into Roger Vivier's elegant Parisian footwear house. Frisoni has acted as Roger Vivier's sole creative director, but has just announced that after this season, he will be stepping down from his spot at the helm.  On February 2nd, it was announced that, by mutual agreement, the Frisoni-Vivier designer fashion partnership will end at the term of the current contract, meaning that the Autumn-Winter 2019 collection, to show in Paris on February 27th, will be the last collaboration that Frisoni will work on.  Diego Della Valle, president and CEO of Tod‚Äôs Group, which owns Roger Vivier stated: ‚ÄúI would like to thank Bruno on my behalf and on behalf of all the people who work for Roger Vivier, for the work which has been done during all these years and I wish Bruno a future filled with new opportunities and success." Bruno Frisoni echoed Della Valle's sentiment, claiming his tenure as creative director as being an "extraordinary adventure." ‚ÄúThese sixteen years dedicated to reviving Roger Vivier represent a fascinating and exceptional experience," said Frisoni in an official statement. "I thank Mr. Diego Della Valle for his trust, Ines, an inspiration and a friend forever and of course the talented teams and collaborators who allowed me to bring the brand where it is today. An extraordinary adventure. "  Under Frisoni's eye, Roger Vivier has seen growth, success, and oh-so-French, chic and quintessentially campaigns. There's no news yet about who will take over the creative direction of Vivier. In any event, we're eager to see what's in store for the Roger Vivier collaboration-concluding Autumn-Winter 2019 collection.

 Film has always been ripe with fashion inspiration. Cinema has had a perpetual, potent impact on our culture‚Äîand that includes the fashion world. The garb worn by characters from the '50s through today tend to shape what we slip into, whether we realize it or not. A little black dress and pearls? You know which doe-eyed heroine that invokes. Not to mention, the talented costume designers behind these looks have found new fame bringing stories to life. So rather than look to the catwalk or the street for sartorial inspo, let these characters influence your next outfit choice. Outer space never felt so in. The best way to wear metallics is to treat them as a neutral, so rather than defaulting to head-to-toe white as the weather warms, switch over to silver. If halogen-esque boots are too much, keep them for evening.

 Gizele Oliveira  wears the combat boots, gold chains, and floor-sweeping coats that define a season melding street with glamour. Ushering in a new season doesn‚Äôt call for a total wardrobe overhaul. But it is the perfect time to reassess. What is working in your closet, what makes you feel good, and what‚Äîin the famed words of Marie Kondo‚Äîsparks joy? It‚Äôs also a time to decide which trends resonate with you. Are you the sort of girl who prefers kick-ass boots? Are you ready for a bucket hat, a floor-sweeping coat, a solid-gold chain-link necklace? Scroll through the 8 trends we predict will define the Fall/Winter 2019 season, plus shop the pieces that make your heart race.   Moto Girl Buckle up, because this season, it‚Äôs all about the motorcycle boot. After months of ladylike kitten heels, we‚Äôre primed for footwear with a little more attitude. Whether streamlined and simple √† la The Row, with all the bells and whistles by Prada, or knee-high via Alexander McQueen, the message is clear: We‚Äôre not here to play.  Cape Town Maybe all superheroes do wear capes. Runways from Miu Miu to Celine championed the return of the cape for winter. The tailored look benefits from a dose of the unexpected, like pairing it with a sheer top layered over a bralette or even a biker short. In other words, life is all about balance.  For the Love of Logos 
  Fashion‚Äôs navel-gazing obsession with logos continues. And we‚Äôre here for it. Though shoes and bags look great with the right brand insignia, the latest iteration is found on fetching logo tights. Let your hosiery do the talking‚Äîa sheer skirt helps get the word out. Great Scott Somewhere between schoolgirl uniforms, classic Scottish tartans, and ‚Äô90s grunge lies the current version of the plaid trend. A good tartan benefits from a little polish mixed with some edge. And a girl can never go wrong with a great tailored suit. Bonus points for a statement shoulder.

  For those who prefer to make an entrance: Floor-sweeping coats bring the drama‚Äîand the utility. Saint Laurent‚Äôs bold silhouette in winter white was a winner of the Fall 2019 runways. Altuzarra and Balenciaga also offered eye-catching ankle grazers. A gold chain-link necklace is the perfect finishing touch, and another standout piece of the season.  Skate Culture Though not mutually exclusive, the Bermuda short and bucket hat trends honor each other. The idea is very: A skate rat from the mid-‚Äô90s has grown up and lovingly embraced minimalism. Take your oversize, long shorts in black leather and your cool-kid bucket hat in a leopard print, and call it a chic day.  Tulle Kit 
  For all of fall‚Äôs moto boots and leather separates, the season also brings a true dose of femininity in voluminous, heart-stopping tulle gowns. Designers from Valentino to Khaite to Simone Rocha proved that after-dark can go beyond slinky slip dresses. When it comes to evening, or even a very #extra day look, go big or go home. Cozy Bags

 From the trends to know to the rising swim brands.  As if Miami in July isn't hot enough, each year the hottest swim brands flock to the Florida city to showcase the latest in swimwear trends. From buzzy new brands to fresh swimsuit styles and a philanthropic show giving back to kids across South Florida, this year's Miami Swim Week definitely had the range‚Äîand all the vacation essentials to go with it. Catch up on the highlights and must-know trends from the week ahead.  During a week of many spray tans and blond bombshells, Sports Illustrated Swimsuit's runway served as a breath of fresh air. The show, which was opened by Halima Aden wearing a Cynthia Rowley burkini, featured models of all ages, races, sizes, and backgrounds.  Aside from being both inclusive and diverse, the runway served as a huge opportunity for up-and-coming models. The show had an open casting call, and models from this year's Swimsuit Issue mentored the contestants throughout the process. In the end, 16 new models were selected to walk alongside the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit models.  Ultra-high, '80s-inspired cuts continued to reign as the biggest swimwear trend. The throwback look appeared in both bikini and one-piece forms‚Äîwith brands like Revival and SageSwim going for even higher, exaggerated versions of the suit.  Clockwise from left: Revival, TJ Swim, SageSwim For the ninth year in a row, Style Saves, a Miami-based nonprofit helping to provide clothing to underprivileged students, hosted its Swim Week show fundraising for its annual back-to-school initiative project. Hosted at The Setai by Rocky Barnes and Style Saves founder Rachael Russell Saiger, the runway show featured collections by four swim brands: Kai Lani,  Maheli Heli,  Macaed, and  Abruzzo Swim‚Äîand many appearances by the cutest mini models.  The sold-out event and silent auction helped raise money for Style Saves' August back-to-school event, which will provide 7,500 students the opportunity to "shop" for uniforms, backpacks, schoolsupplies, shoes, and accessories in a department store-style setup. Even if you didn't attend the event, you can still sponsor a student's back-to-school wardrobe at stylesaves.org.  Ideal for those who want to save on SPF, long-sleeve swimsuits had a moment‚Äîfrom one-pieces at Acacia to bikinis at Nookie Beach to an off-the-shoulder option from Devon Windsor's swimwear debut. Clockwise from top left: Acacia, Nookie Beach, Devon Windsor Model-helmed brands continued to rule the swimwear scene. Candice Swanepoel touched down at Miami Swim Week to show the latest collection from her Tropic of C line. For 2020, the model looked to her native South Africa for inspiration‚Äîfrom Earth and jungle-inspired prints to minimal '90s cuts that can double as bodysuits (as she flawlessly demonstrated).  Meanwhile, Devon Windsor was busy launching a new swim brand of her own. The fellow Victoria's Secret model launched her eponymous brand complete with a wide range of both cover-ups and swimsuits‚Äîincluding many long-sleeve and off-the-shoulder styles.  The one-shoulder swimsuit staged a comeback with brands opting for both one-piece and bikini iterations of the trend.  Clockwise from left: Nookie Beach, Chloe Rose, Maheli Heli at Style Saves  Sustainability continued to be a topic on everyone's mind‚Äîthough it's notoriously more difficult to achieve with swimwear. To spark more conversation on the issue, The UpCycle Project and Paraiso hosted an UpCycle challenge between design students across the country. Nine students from schools like FIT, Parsons, and the Miami Institute partnered with swimwear brands including Vitamin A, Cynthia Rowley, L*Space, Maaji, and Volcom to create two-piece collections from each of the brand's upcycled leftover textiles.  Additionally, Maaji announced the launch of its Earth Warriors line, made of eco-conscious materials and recycled fabrics. Coming as no surprise, animal prints continued to rule swim runways for another season. Leopard and tiger made the most appearances‚Äîwith brands like Vitamin A, Monday Swimwear, and Kai Lani doubling up on the prints in both swimsuits and cover-ups.

 Denim itself may never go out of style, but some of these jeans definitely have. At this point, most of us accept that jeans never really go out of style. But this staple in everyone's wardrobe has certainly evolved since denim first came into fashion. Want proof? Here, we take a look at the past six decades of denim. In 1934, Levi's introduced their first pair of women's jeans, which were worn mostly by women who lived on farms and ranches. Sixteen year later, jeans were still linked with that western vibe ‚Äî but they also had an air of coolness to them. Thanks to Hollywood's popular western films and cowboys being very much in vogue, jeans started appearing in many movies and publicity shots, like this one of actress Jane Russell. Likewise, actress Doris Day also wore jeans in her similarly western-inspired promotional image that Warner Brothers commissioned. In the early '50s, Levi's started selling women's jeans more widespread throughout the country, while Marilyn Monroe made jeans even more popular by wearing her pair (cuffed, dark indigo, and super boxy) in the first film where she received top billing, Clash By Night. By now jeans were really picking up steam for fashionable women, and women across the pond, too. Here, an early street style image of a young woman window shopping in London's Piccadilly neighborhood. Princess Diana is often credited as being the first Princess to publicly wear jeans, but that's not true: Here Princess Alexandra of Kent wears jeans to play tennis at her family home in Buckinghamshire. Jeans as activewear: how far we've come. Actress Gail Russell also wears boxy, cuffed jeans for outdoor activities. Actress Joan Collins wore her jeans uncuffed ‚Äî and significantly more fitted in the leg. She's famously said that she doesn't think women over 40 should wear blue jeans, but here, she's just 22 years old. (Also: we disagree with that statement of hers.) Actress Debra Paget on the set of Love Me Tender, a western with musical numbers. Her jeans take us back to the cuffed hem, but are a lighter wash. Brigitte Bardot was among the first women unable to resist pairing jeans with a simple white T-shirt. Perfection. Italian actress Sandra Milo cements it: the jeans & white T-shirt look was A Thing. Italian singer Mina wears a pair with a notably long hem, and no cuff. Lucille Ball, in a Broadway production of Wildcat, reps more of the cuffed, boxy look, which makes sense because her character's supposed to be an oil miner. On the set of I Love Lucy, though, her jeans were more fitted and feminine. In The Parent Trap, Hayley Mills shows that jeans, by now, weren't just for western looks or  fashion-forward women. Jeans were mainstream, a go-to choice for everyday, casual looks for kids, too. Brigitte Bardot wears her pair slimmer in the leg, uncuffed, ushering in a decade of more bootcut styles.  Pauline Boty, the only female member of the British pop artist movement, kicks back in her bootcut pair. (Note the raw, unfinished hem.)  Goldie Hawn sporting what jean shorts used to look like. Jean Seberg rolls her blue jeans and pairs with another iconic complement: the striped tee. (Seberg, an American originally, moved to France for a few years, and when asked by a Toledo newspaper what she missed most about the U.S., blue jeans were high on her list.) Brigitte Bardot in her favorite style, the bootcut jean. Model Jean Shrimpton keeps the bootcut look going strong. This Levi's ad shows how lighter, brighter denim was coming into fashion. Low-rise denim, as seen here on a woman at the Woodstock music festival. In an advertisement for the 23rd Annual Tony Awards, flared denim takes center stage. Months after this picture was taken, The New York Times declared that with jeans, "the more worn in they seem, the better. This has led to the popularity of patched denims and the frayed cuffs, some of which are deliberately slashed." Wonder if this woman, on the Sunset Strip in L.A., deliberately slashed her pair? Four high school girls wearing Landlubber jeans, an ultra-popular brand in the '70s. A young woman shopping in Mallorca shows how fitted the waists of jeans had become. This Levi's ad raises the question: Who really needs back pockets, anyway? Jane Birkin, on vacation, loved a flare jean like Brigitte Bardot loved a bootcut jean. (And also an unfinished hem. She was big on that, too.) ABBA showing how jeans are really the perfect airport staple...and also how patchwork and embroidery could really spice up classic denim. Jane Birkin, filming Catherine et Cie, still the denim goddess. Charo, on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, sports a low-rise pair that hits severalinches below her belly button.

 Cara Delevingne and Penelope Cruz both walked the runway in the late designer's final collection for the house. "It's like walking in a painting." Karl Lagerfeld's words, along with his unforgettable legacy, filled the Grand Palais in Paris today for the late designer's final Chanel collection. It was a somber, yet beautiful occasion as the fashion house and its guests all mourned the loss of Lagerfeld, who died just two weeks ago at the age of 85.  Known for his over-the-top Chanel runway sets over the years, Lagerfeld's grand finale for the house was a wintry, snow-filled village complete with mountains and Swiss chalets. Models emerged out of the 'Chalet Gardenia,' before walking the snowy runway. Throughout the show, Chanel paid tribute to its late creative director in a series of beautiful tributes.  Chanel commemorated Lagerfeld with touching sketches left on all the seats of attendees. The sketches featured an illustration of Karl and Coco Chanel hand-drawn by Lagerfeld himself along with the poignant words, "the beat goes on..."   Farewell, Karlüñ§ A post shared by  Carine Roitfeld (@carineroitfeld) on Mar 4, 2019 at 10:54pm PST Just before the Fall 2019 show began, audio recordings of Lagerfeld speaking in French played over speakers. "It's like walking in a painting," the late designer mused in one of the recordings. The house then held a minute of silence for the room to pay respects to Lagerfeld.  Both a muse and close friend of Karl, Cara Delevingne opened the show wearing a full-length houndstooth coat over a checked tweed jumpsuit. The stunning black and white look featured a matching hat and beaded Chanel necklaces. A longtime brand ambassador to Chanel, Cruz walked the runway this season instead of sitting front row. Donning an all white look, the actress carried a single white rose with her down the runway‚Äîa subtle, but beautiful nod to Lagerfeld.  Naomi Campbell, Marion Cotillard, Kristen Stewart, Janelle Monae, Monica Bellucci, Claudia Schiffer, and Karen Elson were amongst those in attendance at the show.   The show began with a series of tweed and houndstooth looks all done in Lagerfeld's signature white and black color palette. Tapping into the snowy backdrop, the collection then veered into apr√®s ski, done Chanel style.  In-between, a range of bright looks added some major color to the runway in the form of hot pink, turquoise, orange red, and purple. The pieces ranged from colorful striped puffer coats to knitwear and tweed skirt suits.  The show then ended with a series of all white, angelic looks ranging from tailored suiting to feather and jewel-encrusted cocktail dresses.  For the finale, David Bowie‚Äôs ‚ÄúHeroes‚Äù played (the same song that closed Lagerfeld‚Äôs final collection for Fendi in Milan) as a parade of models, many fighting back tears, stormed the snow-filled runway. It was an emotional farewell to Lagerfeld's unforgettable legacy both at Chanel, and in fashion.     Karl Lagerfeld‚Äôs final #Chanel show ‚ù§Ô∏è In his words, ‚Äúit‚Äôs like walking in a painting.‚Äù @chanelofficial  Regram Fashion Director @nicolefritton A post shared by  Harper's BAZAAR (@harpersbazaarus) on Mar 5, 2019 at 3:23am PST Before his passing in February, Lagerfeld served as Chanel's creative director since 1983. Today marks his final collection after designing for the house for 36 years. He will be succeeded by Virginie Viard, his longtime collaborator and director of Chanel's Fashion Creation Studio. 
 From holiday parties to New Year's Eve.  There's plenty to love about the holiday season‚Äîlong meals with family, cozy nights drinking mulled wine with friends, and a stream of invitations to parties and dinners. With so much on the calendar, it's a fun time of year to get a little playful with your personal style. Here, four different outfit ideas for four very different occasions.  Shown above: Guess blazer, $108, guess.com; Guess pants, $98, guess.com; stylist's own Headband; FLRNZ ring A Dinner Party Treat a holiday dinner party as an excuse to dazzle, particularly if you‚Äôre amongst friends. Neutrals are chic and speak to a festive (but still sophisticated) mood. Experiment with textures and shades in classic combinations, like a mini dress with matching over-the-knee boots. It‚Äôs a strong look, so keep your makeup, hair, and jewelry a bit more low-key. Guess dress, $128, guess.com; Young Frankk necklace, Guess boots, $169, guess.com Cozy Cocktails When drinking eggnog, mulled wine, or any number of warm, seasonal cocktails, a fireplace and an oversized knitted sweater is a must. Pair one with a minuscule leather mini for the perfect combination of cozy and cool. Introduce rich, winter hues through a deep plum lip and a khaki-grey ankle boot, and finish with sweet hair accessories like a gilded clip or a ribbon bow. Ganni sweater; Guess skirt, $79, guess.com; Reik Nen boots; Beck Jewels earrings. The New Year's Eve Party Now this is the time to go all-out‚Äîno holds barred, over-the-top, anything goes flamboyant. Reach for sequins and feathers and fringe; all that glitters is indeed gold in this case. Whether you choose a short hem and a streamlined silhouette or dramatic, voluminous, floor-sweeping proportions, what matters most is your attitude. To that end, layer on the jewelry, pop the Champagne, and ring in the new year on the most stylish note. Guess dress, guess.com; Topshop bag; FLRNZ ring Festive Brunch For a low-key, chill holiday brunch, you want to be comfortable‚Äîwithout compromising on chic. Layering is key; semi-sheer pantyhose and opaque ankle socks pair nicely, especially when tucked into a heeled loafer. Choose a long-sleeved mini in a wintery slate (under whatever giant coat you‚Äôre sporting) and swap your beanie for a knitted headband. Bonus points for sparkles.

 Shoulder pads, power suits, and beyond.  The 1980s were a decade of bold style, colors, and silhouettes‚Äîpermed hair included.

 The singer is working on her first ready-to-wear collection for the brand.  Selena Gomez is back with a second collection for Coach‚Äîand this time it's going beyond handbags and into ready-to-wear clothing.  Launching this fall, the actress/singer's next design collaboration with the fashion brand will include ready-to-wear clothing, outerwear, handbags and accessories.  "I always look forward to designing with Selena because she has a strong point of view. We wanted to bring cool new ideas to the table and I loved getting her take on clothes as much as accessories this time around," Stuart Vevers, creative director at Coach, said in a statement from the brand.  The collection will be inspired by Gomez's own personal style and feature what the brand refers to as "an unapologetically confident and powerful feminine spirit." On Instagram, Gomez shared a first sneak-peek at the clothing, revealing the label of a peach and pink lace dress.   Fam, my second collection for @coach is going to include clothes! So grateful I got to work on this with @stuartvevers. Can‚Äôt wait to show you this fall. #CoachxSelena #CoachNY A post shared by  Selena Gomez (@selenagomez) on Mar 12, 2018 at 7:14pm PDT "I am so excited to be working with Coach again. Getting to create my own collection with Stuart has been such a fun process, and I can‚Äôt wait for everyone to see what we have been working on over the past several months," Gomez said in a statement.   Last fall, the singer debuted her first Coach collection, which included a range of handbags and small accessories. As the face of the brand, she also already has two ad campaigns under her belt. Though it's unclear how long the ongoing partnership between Gomez and Coach is slated to last, it definitely isn't showing signs of slowing down any time soon.  
 The shop is an homage to Dapper Dan's famed Harlem boutique which closed in 1992.  Back in May, the internet accused Gucci of knocking off a jacket included in its Cruise 2018 collection. The design in question was a fur bomber with balloon sleeves logoed in Gucci's signature G's that looked a whole lot like a jacket designed by Harlem couturier Dapper Dan in the '80s.  Soon after, the fashion house responded to backlash on Instagram stating the jacket was an "homage" to Dapper Dan and his legendary hip-hop fashion. Then in September, Dapper Dan himself appeared in a Gucci menswear campaign and it was announced that the two would partner up to bring back the tailor's famed Harlem boutique that was shut down in 1992.  Now, a first look inside the Gucci x Dapper Dan Harlem atelier is finally here. The 4,700 square-foot space, featuring both a storefront and an atelier studio, is nestled in a brownstone on Lenox Ave in Harlem. Opening in January, the shop will operate by appointment only and allow shoppers to have bespoke garments designed by Dapper Dan using Gucci raw materials, fabrics, prints, embroidered patches, and hardware.   "Everyone paid homage to Dapper Dan, but no one ever paid him. The people have spoken and Gucci has listened. Nothing has been more significant in the Harlem cultural scene than Alessandro and Gucci coming to Harlem and partnering with Dapper Dan," Dapper Dan said in a statement from the brand.  According to a release from Gucci, the collaborative project is inspired "Made in Italy meets Made in Harlem and the 1980s meets 2018."   The atelier studio isn't the only project between the Italian fashion house and the Harlem-based couturier in the works. Along with the store, a Gucci x Dapper Dan capsule collection will be included as part of Gucci's Fall 2018 collection.
 UNHCR Special Envoy  Angelina Jolie reports from the  front row of RefuSHE‚Äôs  pioneering fashion show in support  of refugee artisans. In all her years as an Academy Award‚Äìwinning actress and director, Angelina Jolie‚Äîthe most glamorous woman on the planet‚Äînever went to a fashion show. ‚ÄúI hadn‚Äôt  been to one before,‚Äù the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Special Envoy says of the experience of finding herself seated front row during a visit to a refugee shelter in Nairobi, Kenya, last June. ‚ÄúBut it was my kind of runway: the most beautiful girls, survivors with their heads held high, bringing forward their own designs and culture; showing how it‚Äôs possible to find your femininity again after it has been brutally attacked.‚Äù This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. The shelter Jolie visited on World Refugee Day is run by RefuSHE, an NGO that seeks to fill a crucial gap in care for girls and young women between the ages of 13 and 23 fleeing Somalia, South Sudan, and other war-torn countries in the region. ‚ÄúAll the girls I met had been separated from their families or had seen their parents killed,‚Äù says Jolie. ‚ÄúAlmost all had suffered sexual violence, and many had given birth after being raped.‚Äù RefuSHE provides counseling and shelter and conducts a multidisciplinary education program. With the support of UNHCR, RefuSHE also encourages economic empowerment by teaching the young women to make colorful scarves using resist-dyeing, a traditional East African technique similar to tie-dye. This gives the refugees a marketable skill that can help set them on a path toward financial independence. One hundred percent of the proceeds from the scarves they make are reinvested into the program and its artisans; since 2010, nearly 70 percent of them have become self-sufficient.  ‚ÄúI thought the girls represented their culture and their craft in a way that was so impressive,‚Äù Jolie says of the runway show, which culminated in the audience rising to its feet and dancing with the models. ‚ÄúThey are women in full.‚Äù The program is part of a UNHCR initiative, MADE51, that aims to bring market access to refugee artisans. RefuSHE bag, $65, shop.refushe.org. SHOP Now MADE51 is helping RefuSHE expand its product line with a new range of bags made by artisans living in Kakuma, a refugee camp in northwest Kenya where Jolie built a school for girls, and at the nearby Kalobeyei Settlement. The fabric will be hand-dyed in Nairobi and then sent to Kakuma, where the artisans will tailor it into totes, shoppers, and clutches. From there the bags will be sent to Kalobeyei, where a group of Ethiopian artisans, renowned for their beading skills, will add embellishments. ‚ÄúThere is so much talent within refugee populations that goes to waste because people are not allowed to work or are not able to work,‚Äù Jolie says. For Halima Aden, a 20-year-old Somali-American model who spent the first seven years of her life in Kakuma, the RefuSHE program is a welcome addition to camp life, where enterprising women rely on a barter economy of trading incense or braiding hair to make ends meet.‚ÄúI wish my mom had something like that in the camp,‚Äù Aden says. ‚ÄúAs a refugee, sometimes you feel like you don‚Äôt have a say in the world, so it‚Äôs nice that women can now have a hand in their own destinies. The craft they learn is something they can take with them because knowledge sticks with you.‚Äù  RefuSHE scarf, $44, shop.refushe.org.  SHOP By integrating various artisanal skills and spreading the work among different camps, the program gives the maximum number of refugees an opportunity to apply their skills and earn an income, which is especially important in the remote Kenyan camps where the semi-arid climate is unsuitable for agriculture. MADE51 projects that if retailers get involved and place orders, there is the potential to create 12,000 new jobs in Kenya alone. ‚ÄúWe need more initiatives like this,‚Äù Jolie says, pointing to refugee-artisan communities in 70 countries, ranging from Rwandan basket¬≠makers to Afghan kilim weavers, that could also benefit from MADE51. ‚ÄúNobody wants to be a refugee or to live on aid,‚Äù she adds. ‚ÄúThey want to lead dignified, useful lives, like any of us. So I hope this is just the beginning.‚Äù
 Naomi, Christy, Gisele, Gigi, Kaia, and more star in the ads. Update, 12/18: Versace has unveiled its full Spring 2018 campaign in its entirety‚Äìand it's just as supermodel-filled as we expected. From Christy to Naomi to Kaia, see all the images below.

Like the runway collection, the Spring 2018 ads act as a tribute to the late Gianni Versace, 20 years after his tragic death. Lensed by Steven Meisel, the campaign stars multiple generations of supermodels including Naomi Campbell, Christy Turlington, Gisele B√ºndchen, Natalia Vodianova, Raquel Zimmermann, Gigi Hadid, Kaia Gerber, Irina Shayk, Vittoria Ceretti, Cara Taylor, Birgit Kos, Grace Elizabeth, and Noah Luis Brown.  A new school take on a family tradition - conceived by Artistic Director, @Donatella_Versace and shot by legendary collaborator #StevenMeisel, the #VersaceSS18 Campaign portrays - together for the first time in decades - some of the most iconic forces in fashion along with today‚Äôs hottest talent, in individual portraits capturing their unique personalities. #VFamily _ @iamnaomicampbell wearing a Vogue print look from the #VersaceSS18 #VersaceTribute collection.

 It's not a must-have until Bad Gal Riri says so.  As we all know, Rihanna has the superhuman power to take any look, any accessory, or anything and make it instantly cool. Her latest feat? Convincing us all that we absolutely need a pair of "Thottie or Nice?" socks this holiday season (come to think of it, how do I not already have a pair of "Thottie or Nice?" socks in my life?). The singer, who will now be known as the new Santa Claus, unveiled another collection of socks in collaboration with Stance just in time for the holiday season. Featuring nine different styles, the collection most notably includes a pair of over-the-knee Santa-inspired socks and mid-calf socks that pose the important question, thottie or nice? Offered in two colorways, the thottie or nice socks of course act as the true star of the latest Fenty x Stance collection. And ranging in price from $14- $24, they also happen to make the ideal stocking stuffer this holiday season (or maybe just treat yourself to a pair before they sell out). Surely Santa is out there somewhere thanking Bad Gal Riri for the fresh material.   Of course this isn't the first time Rihanna designed a collection that made us actually excited about socks. Over the summer, the singer released a collection with Stance transforming her most iconic red carpet moments into sock form‚Äîwhich, unsurprisingly, sold out instantly.  The #ICONICcollection x @stancemuse  is out and available for purchase now at ---> Stance.com/Rihanna #RihannaRedCarpetBox #MetGala A post shared by  badgalriri (@badgalriri) on Aug 16, 2017 at 10:20am PDT The good news is that Rihanna's holiday collection hasn't sold out just yet; you can shop the Fenty x Stance socks online now at stance.com.

SHOP Creative director Jeremy Scott's love of pop culture lends itself well to collaborations‚Äîhe's previously worked with Magnum, Adidas, McDonald's and Santa Cruz Skateboards ‚Äîbut his sense of playfulness and fun have attracted some raised eyebrows in the industry by those who think he's making fun of the fashion world. "I'm just trying to raise a smile," he told us back in June. "Clothes aren't meant to be worshipped at a church altar. I have a different approach to most designers."

 Your new must-have boots are waiting A year-round wardrobe staple, the boot can work through five-course dinner parties just as eloquently as on a crisp autumn stroll around the farmers‚Äô market. And, hey, they're warm.  As utilitarian as it may be, one size does not fit every event. A classic Chelsea can get you far, but the truly style savvy have a toe on the pulse of this season‚Äôs freshest trends. For instance, new dimensions enhance the combat boot and its knee-high cousin. Pairing the metallic boot in all its glory with equally statement-making pieces has a surprisingly modern result. Which proves: It‚Äôs not just what shoe you have‚Äîit‚Äôs what you do with it.  Ready to command fall‚Äôs biggest boot trends? Here's how. No fall shoe works harder than the ankle boot. A neutral patent iteration instantly dresses up a jeans-and-sweater combo, and adds much-needed edge to sweeter pieces.  This Fendi pair beautifully bridges the textual divide between a structured tweed jacket and an ethereal organza pleated skirt.  Fendi blazer, $4,800, and skirt, $1,790; Celine sunglasses, $460; Vhemier ring, $5,600; Lana Jewelry Gold Braided Hoops, $2,120 This fall‚Äôs military-inspired boot isn‚Äôt like those of summer musical festivals and outdoor bars. It‚Äôs much more involved, serious, and inherently badass. The Prada Lug-Sole Leather Combat Boots are as fierce as they are useful, featuring mini pouches with zip enclosures. If you weren‚Äôt ready for the battle that is life, you surely will be in these stompers.  Button up in an army-green belted coat and aviators for good measure. Keep in mind: It‚Äôs not Halloween, so avoid going full-costume by offsetting your structural focal points with lighter fabrics, like in a pleated print midi-skirt. Prada jacket, $3,260; Sacai skirt, $1,245; Loewe sunglasses, $430; Repossi ring, $4,750; GU_DE Bag, $710 There was a time when the metallic boot did it all. Alone, it was the beacon of a stunning ensemble (and still is). However, this fall, boots like this gold metallic Gianvito Rossi pair have a profound effect when matched with equally statement-making pieces.  Paired with a multi-print or paisley wrap dress, croc-embossed crossbody, and chain-link earrings‚Äîall in the same neutral-metallic tones‚Äîthe boots become less loud and more modern, enhancing a ‚Äô70-esque ensemble rather than outshining the pack. Jonathan Simkhai dress, $795; Dior sunglasses, $375; Vhernier earrings, $4,250; Chlo√© bag, $1,690  They may exude a cabin-life aesthetic, but glammed-up outdoorsy footwear, like these Christian Louboutin faux fur leather hiking boots, are made for city, suburban, and all-stylish-terrain walking (read: brunching and shopping). The stud trim brings an edge to the traditional hiker boot, allowing you to take it casual with the rest of your outfit.  A luxurious shearling jacket on top of a ribbed turtle- or mock neck and high-rise distressed jeans are all you need. Warm? Cozy? You‚Äôre welcome. Bottega Veneta jacket, $6,700; Tot√™me top, $360; Khaite jeans, $380; Anita Ko necklace, $1,575; Fendi Small Catwalk Top Handle bag, $3,390 You could weather the cold months in traditional black knee-high boots, but that would be boring‚Äîand you‚Äôre not boring. This season, have a lot more fun with your extended footwear in a textured, hued iteration. These Paris Texas knee-high python-embossed leather boots  in dark red may be a statement on their own, but pairing them with a black dress with voluminous sleeves, a matching headband, and a structured geometric handbag, gets you a gothically romantic look that can make any dreary, drab day so much more interesting.

  Ski wear reaches new levels of cool.   
  Who said ski wear can‚Äôt make a statement? Leave the bland parkas and unbecoming snow pants behind, and trade them in for pants and coats that feel more couture than casual. After all, we've seen sturdy cold weather apparel receive a marvelous makeover in contemporary fashion, so keeping warm while looking chic is an easy feat. The traditional apr√®s ski look, while sophisticated, isn't necessarily the most daring, so why not live a little bit on the edge with pieces that imbue a bold, more fashion-forward vibe? Case in point: 3 Moncler Grenoble's new collection of exciting and directional ski wear.  This season, designer Sandro Mandrino elevated the collection to a conceptual level that sat above even the atmospheric by injecting the spirit of 1969 into every single piece. Think: Colors, patterns, and unexpected details perfect for anyone but timid ski bunnies. Only the boldest and most adventurous statement-makers need apply.

 New Bottega is the new Old C√©line.  Nostalgia has been dominating fashion's biggest trends over the past two years. In fact, fashion's longing for the past ran so deep it sparked an entire Old C√©line movement spearheaded by an Instagram account paying homage to the brand's look under former creative director Phoebe Philo. Now, a new Instagram account, @newbottega, inspired by Bottega Veneta's new creative director, finally has the fashion set looking forward instead of back.  You've likely already seen the square-toed sandals and buttery leather bags on your feeds. The crop of lust-worthy accessories is ushering in a new era of Bottega Veneta under the reins of Daniel Lee, who was appointed the brand's creative director last year. His debut fall collection has already been widely embraced by top fashion influencers, models, and even its own fan account that's quickly gaining momentum on Instagram.    The distinctive square-toe designs are officially making the once-taboo shoe shape cool again. From pillowy quilted mule heels to strappy thong sandals and sleek leather, the minimal footwear feels both fresh and unexpectedly elegant. The see-through netted pumps feature a gold chain, combining the anklet trend with a shoe style once reserved for the office only‚Äîa formula fashion girls have unsurprisingly already obsessed over. As for Lee's mark on Bottega's bags, he is bringing forth a new vision of luxury and elegance mixed with a touch of cool. Smooth as butter, the leather designs range from quilted shoulder bags to minimal and structured work totes that are anything but boring. Other standouts include slouchy clutches (a.k.a. mini clouds for you to carry) and modern bucket bags complete with oversize chain links.    It's no surprise to learn that Lee, whose vision is already shaping trends both on Instagram and IRL, previously worked at Celine under Phoebe Philo (like I said, New Bottega is the new Old C√©line). But could Bottega's new era of accessories be enough for fashion to finally move on from its infatuation with ultra-tiny micro bags and '90s throwbacks? If @newbottega's increasing following has anything to say, they will. 
 ‚ÄúWhen the government fails, I want you to commit to standing with the women who need to be heard, deserve to be heard, and have the right to be heard.‚Äù Last night, Diane von Furstenberg hosted the 10th Annual DVF Awards, in which she honored five women making extraordinary change across the world. Included amongst the group of trailblazing women honored this year was Anita Hill, who was awarded the Lifetime Leadership Award, and Katy Perry, who received the Inspiration Award.  Professor Hill, who took home the big award of the evening, was introduced and presented the honor by Gloria Steinem. Currently a professor of social policy, law, and women‚Äôs studies at Brandeis University, Hill was recognized for her years of work fighting for race and gender equality, along with sexual harassment. Accepting the Lifetime Leadership Award, Hill delivered a powerful speech and call to action. "I know that most of you first came to know me in 1991. No one would have predicted 28 years ago that I would still be here. The due process is designed to make women like myself disappear,‚Äù Hill said. "I believe that advocating for equality is a noble endeavor and I also believe that, unfortunately today, the high price of demand for equality all too often falls on the most vulnerable."  Closing the night out, she ended her speech with a powerful call-to-action. ‚ÄúWhen the government fails, I want you to commit to standing with the women who need to be heard, deserve to be heard and have the right to be heard,‚Äù she said.  Taking home the Inspiration Award, Katy Perry was honored for her work with UNICEF as well as her voice within the LGBTQ community. After being presented the award by Arianna Huffington, the singer declared, "intersectional feminism is the only kind of feminism.‚Äù Alongside Hill and Perry, this year's other DVF Awards went to Susan Burton, Nadia Murad, and Hadeel Mustafa Anabtawi. Burton, who founded A New Way of Life Reentry Project, an organization in South Los Angeles that provides housing, employment assistance, legal services, and leadership development to women rebuilding their lives after incarceration, won the People's Voice Award.    The DVF International Award was given to two recipients this year: Nadia Murad and Hadeel Mustafa Anabtawi. Murad was recognized for her work advocating for survivors of genocide and sexual violence in her homeland of Iraq after attacks on the Yazidi people. Mustafa Anabtawi received the honor for founding The Alchemist Lab, an educational center offering children in cities, remote villages, and refugee camps additional skills to help with their education, developmental needs, and confidence. 
 Dive right in...  Cult Gaia first made retail waves with its Gaia's Ark bag, a beachy-bamboo design that quickly put the brand on the fashion map. Ready-to-wear and shoes soon followed, as well as statement jewelry, all created with the same bold, slightly-retro, cool-girl approach to style. These are not clothes and accessories for shrinking daisies.   Next up for the Insta-friendly brand? Swimwear, of course‚Äîthe first full collection from the label after doing a collaboration in the space. And minimal black one-pieces these are not. Instead, designer Jasmine Larian is going all in on bright, sculptural bikinis and one-pieces, which just launched on cultgaia.com. Below, hear from Larian on why it was time for bathing suits, what inspired her, and which icon she'd love to see wear the pool-ready pieces.  Everyone kept asking us and it became hard to ignore. Everything I‚Äôve done for this brand has been super-organic and there‚Äôs never been a true rhyme or reason..it has always just been when I feel it's right and when everything falls into place. Resort is also my favorite season because it feels very wanderlust. I also have the longest time to concept and design the collection. Serendipity. I started designing swim that ties back to our ready-to-wear because I love keeping a lot of our styles sheer and use it as a layering piece so the clothing has more end uses. l have always been the person that buys the cover-up to wear with jeans and at the beach so that‚Äôs how this collection really came to be. I also think our visual language aesthetic has evolved and so much of our hardware and accessories design lends itself to elements that look so beautiful in our swimwear. Like the amorphous faux tortoise and brass rings that we used as a detail and the clear straps that make it look like the bikini is suspended on the body. I imagined a modern goddess woman went back in time to 60s poolside parties and what she‚Äôd be wearing. We also derived a lot of inspiration from the brand itself and made sure that every fabrication looked almost iridescent in a non-obvious way under the warm sun.  It was also important to me to make the collection super wearable and accessible. I used the most flattering and classic shapes and added strong details without it feeling over-designed and overdone.  My friends. In a fantasy world...Monica Belucci, Sofia Loren, Monica Vitti all captured in old school Italian paparazzi.

 She might literally be wearing 50 different shades of gray. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. Zendaya knows how to bring it on a red carpet. And just for the record, sometimes "it" means "literally everything you could ever want in an outfit."  The Euphoria actress turned out for the 2019 ELLE Women in Hollywood celebration at the Beverly Wilshire Four Seasons Hotel in Beverly Hills, California, on Monday night, where she was one of the honorees (other women honored at the event this year included Mindy Kaling, Nicole Kidman, and Dolly Parton).  Zendaya's chic, fashion-forward ensemble in shades of gray featured every fashion trick in the book and posed a direct challenge to the belief that there's such a thing as too many accessories for a single outfit.  To recap, Zendaya sported all of the following‚Äîat the same time: a blazer, a button-up, a skirt, wide-leg pants, pointed heels, a belt, a choker, a statement ring, and stud earrings. ALL. THE. THINGS.  The 23-year-old actress also gave a heartfelt speech and addressed her awe at being included among the other honorees. We know that everyone suffers from imposter syndrome from time to time, but it's clear from where we're sitting that Zendaya definitely belongs in the group of women breaking glass in Hollywood.

Along with the standard sports bras, leggings and workout tees, the brand also has a collection of swimwear that will make you look like an Aussie native.

Along with its empowering graphic tees and pieces, you can also customize leggings with your own workout mantra down the leg.¬† Founded by former model¬†Tatiana Korsakova, Vaara offers a stylized edit of¬†leotards, color-blocked sports bras,¬†cozy sweatshirts, and jersey tops you can wear for working out or lounging.¬†
 Raising the bar on mother-daughter dressing üî• The latest campaign from Ashley Graham's ongoing partnership with Swimsuits for All is here and it co-stars the woman who taught the model body positivity first: her mother.

Blahnik has never followed fashion trends. He makes beautifully feminine, comfortable shoes characterized by their elegant shape and delicate embroidery. With all this in mind, it comes as no surprise that he's the subject of a new documentary entitled Manolo: The Boy Who Makes Shoes For Lizards ‚Äì a reference to his original clientele caught in his mother's back garden in the Canary Islands. "To tell you the truth, I haven't thought about it," he says when asked what he hopes people will learn from the documentary. "I couldn't care less about what people think about me. When you reach a certain age, you don't give a damn. I'm an old boy now. That's the truth. Reputation, fame and being well-known, those things never entered my head. As long as I don't kill people, then I'm happy with anything." Although he says he doesn't care what people think, he does very much care about how he looks ‚Äì and, if truth to be told, he's not thrilled with how he comes across in the documentary, which was created by Michael Roberts. "I would have loved not to have been pictured in it," he says. "I broke my diaphragm after I fell over in my house, and the only way of treating it was with a course of cortisone and, well, I became huge. Each ankle was like a column. The neck was like somebody's whole face. "I wanted to be photographed just from the back, which Robert said he'd do, but it is what it is. I'm not happy with seeing myself on the screen. It makes me vomit. I don't want to see my stupid face again," he says dramatically before laughing loudly.  Whether he wants to see his face again or not, lots of other people do. Style icons and fashion's most zeitgeist brands want to work with him. Case in point is his collaboration with Rihanna, which has resulted in three collections. "I adore her movement," he says. "Her every movement encapsulates all her Bayan culture and that's what captivated me about her. That and her beautiful eyes. But you know, I can't work with everybody. We've done the last collection now and I said to her, 'goodbye my dear darling. That's it. I'm tired.' For the time being, it's over. I can't cope with it all. I'm not a spring baby anymore." He says this but you just know he won't book a holiday, wear a pair of flip-flops (which, incidentally, he's not adverse to) and spend a week doing nothing. "I'm very impatient and I'm not relaxed at all," he says. "In fact, I'm very nervous. I always have been and I always will." His nervous disposition aside, Blahnik is too curious about the world to sit still for long; he's too excited by new ideas and originality. Last season, he was approached by Vetements to work together and couldn't turn it down. Interestingly enough, the label known for its extreme proportions asked Blahnik to dial down his ideas. "Last year, they were doing very exciting things," he says. "I loved what they were doing at Balenciaga - they brought a new philosophy to the shoes. It was beautiful and exaggerated. I wanted to do boots that came up to the bosoms of the girls, but we had to move it down a little because it wasn't very comfortable. If they're given the chance to expand, they're going to be extraordinarily successful. I saw two dresses that John [Galliano] designed for Margiela this weekend and they were divine. Hope is not lost for beautiful clothes." He's quite right ‚Äì and such beauty is even more readily available with the speed of the high street and its designer replicates. Does he ever get aggrieved with the many, many high-street homages of his best-known designs? "I don't care anymore," he says quickly. "Sometimes it's complimentary, but when they're too similar that upsets me. Two years ago, a woman came up to me in Milan and said, 'Do you like my Manolos?' 'I said, well yes I do but these are not Manolos. These are a rip-off.' She took the shoe off and it turned out that they really were authentic Manolos. That's how similar copies have become ‚Äì sometimes I can't tell the difference. Also, they can never replicate the quality." Part of the myth surrounding Manolo is his appearance. You can't imagine him wearing jeans and a T-shirt, nor being unshaven. He looks exactly how you imagine him to, polished in a well-tailored colourful suit, hair combed neatly to one side and a perfect pair of classic shoes. "I was born with this mentality since a child," he said. "Maintenance is important even when you're busy. In the morning I have a quick shower, then a shower at night. There's never a big effort ‚Äì I've never tried to be polished. If you have an old suit that's many years old, you must send it to the cleaners every two weeks or so. That's what you have to do. People have to pay more attention." "I'm a terrible person to be with and to work with" Blahnik has a lot of energy, which he attests to his mother who he says "was always moving, here, there and everywhere and always in kitten heels." Although he claims his life is "terribly boring" ‚Äì ("all I do is studio, work, manufacture, work, home, read, bed, boom") ‚Äì he talks at breakneck speed with an insightful knowledge in everything. The designer also says he's a nightmare to work with ‚Äì even David Bailey, who shot him as the first ever man to cover Vogue, described him as difficult. "I'm a terrible person to be with and to work with," he says. "I'm a perfectionist and in this world, that can be a hindrance rather than an advantage. People want everything so quickly. But for my customers, I insist on making sure something that is well done and that will last." The luxury shoe world is a busy market, but what sets Blahnik apart, what has made him a household name above all others, is the timelessness of his designs and the comfort of his shoes. "It's paramount," he says. "If they're not comfortable don't buy them or throw them away. I'm pleased to hear it when women say they buy our shoes again and again because they're comfortable. Do you know what I hate? Those very tall platform hooker shoes. They're finished now, but I've seen so many." Blahnik describes himself as an optimist ‚Äì and it's an ethos that translates to his often eccentric, decorative designs. "Even in these hard times, which is not easy anywhere, you have to be positive because you have to be," he says firmly. "Every day is a new day. Even in the face of the most horrific tragedy, you have to think up. What other choice is there?" Long live the king of shoes. Manolo: the Boy Who Made Shoes for Lizards is out now. theaters

 Rihanna has started following him on Instagram! Leon Dame has officially delivered the runway version of a Rorschach test. No matter what you see in the model's walk at Margiela's spring 2020 show at Paris Fashion Week, it's certainly... a lot. It all started on Wednesday when the 20-year-old German model closed out the show, clad in a military-inspired look and ready to strut. In video of his journey down the stage, he seems to clamor onto the runway with a slightly hunched posture and a look that could kill. He defiantly stomps down the stage as onlookers capture the moment. He erratically poses, he gallops at one point (??). Another model walks by, appearing intense but nowhere near Dame's level of commitment. Dare I say a model has never been able to look like he could stumble at any moment and still be totally in control?   Closing Maison Margiela SS20 üñ§  @maisonmargiela @jgalliano @lexyroche @katy_england @pat_boguslawski @eugenesouleiman @patmcgrathreal @jesshallettcast  Thank you!! Xx A post shared by  Leon Dame (@leondame) on Sep 25, 2019 at 7:25am PDT  Dame has also graced runways this season for Gucci, Valentino, Alexander McQueen, and Burberry. He even walked last season's Maison Margiela show, so it's likely that creative director John Galliano was inspired by his singular style.  As Dame's walk made its way to Twitter, it became clear that it would be divisive. Some embraced his unorthodox gait as innovative. Others branded it as ahead of its time. Like most revolutionaries, his big break garnered mixed reviews. But, above all, Dame made a mark on Rihanna‚Äîas the singer just recently began following him on Instagram. Here, a collection of reactions to his rule-breaking fashion week showing. wednesday mood: leon dame walking for maison margiela ss20 pic.twitter.com/SOuCuYZKTs Just f***ing brilliant!

 See how Bessie Afnaim Corral styles the go-to cami of her own design. Bessie Afnaim Corral and Oliver Corral are a very chic married couple doing the actual most together‚Äîsplitting time between Italy and New York, designing their year old collection of "See Now Buy Now" luxury essentials, and creating and dismantling a series of very impressive transient stores.  Their lovechild Arj√© is a line for men and women that's presented in chapters and meant to be layered‚Äîboth on the body and in the closet. There's no such thing as "so last season" in the Arje vernacular. The duo is also approaching retail with one of fashion's hottest buzzwords right now (perhaps in part because of Arje's fanciful use of them)‚Äîthe pop up. "The first ‚ÄúArj√© Home‚Äù was launched in 2017 on Mott Street in Nolita and opened 4 months after launching our brand," Afnaim Corral explains, "Creating our first complete world was incredibly rewarding as it pushed us to define our message. This season to coincide with the launch of Chapter Four we opened our largest Store to date, and without our prior physical presences within NYC, this connection to our growing community would have take much longer to establish." Bessie donned her current wardrobe MVP (most valuable player) on the streets of SoHo outside of Arj√©'s current home‚Äîstyling her striped cami three ways for three occasions.  The Creds: Arj√© The Koko Striped Cami Top ($395) + The Ro Striped Blazer ($1,195) + The Rox Striped Pants ($545)    SHOP NOW How would you describe your personal style? My Personal style is built on endless layering. I always take one shade of one color and create around that. And Im totally obsessed with proportions and texture and the touch and feel of the garments. Things have to be shorter or longer in our world and never ‚Äúthe standard." I often wear an oversized knit or outerwear layered over a long silk top back to skinny pants, or I wear big wide leg pants with a long top that has our signature side slits and a smaller knit over it. And I always finish a look with a statement piece of jewelry. From head to toe I am always dressed in one shade, shades that have a spectrum of textures within them, layered in fabrics that feel amazing and in turn I always feel incredibly comfortable in. And of course you will only ever see me in ARJ√â! The Creds: Arj√© The Koko Striped Cami Top ($395) + The Cori Striped Cotton Slit Pants ($425)  SHOP NOW How does Arj√© reflect your style? The Arj√© wardrobe is built on the idea of a monochrome layered wardrobe, made from the highest quality of fabrics sourced in Italy and is true reflection of both mine and Oliver‚Äôs personal style. We are our first customer and we have to be the first to say we would ‚ÄúLive in it‚Äù before we approve a design to go into the collection. We also create in layers and color palettes that always work back to a past and future collection or as we call them ‚ÄúChapters.‚Äù So when you invest in a piece for spring or summer we promise you that the same piece can be work back to a piece you will invest in for Fall.  How is it working with your life partner as a business partner? It is the most amazing thing I could ever think of. Oli and I truly see the same thing, but on a daily basis have a totally different way of approaching things. We challenge each other, we push each other, but the best thing about us is we really complement each other and therefore we trust each other. We have learned from the years of working together for another brand to leave our ego out, to approach every thing as ‚ÄúWe‚Äù and not ‚ÄúI.‚Äù This is what makes our married life and our work life "work", as we are in this together, forever. We are both so aware of the love we put into our life and into our brand is contagious‚Ä¶ When we create in love with a smile on our face people feel it and they want to be a part it. I also happen to love love the mix of feminine and masculine energy within the brand as it feels so balanced. The Creds: Arj√© The Koko Cami Top ($395) + The Kris Blazer ($1,295) + The Rox Solid Pants ($525) SHOP NOW How would you want someone just walking into the Arj√© store to describe the brand? I would love people to feel like they have found home‚Äîthat the brand feels familiar, yet incredibly modern, it feels warm and welcoming and feels like a complete world they want to be a part of forever. Why did you want to launch your own Brand? I have always always always dreamed of having my own brand with my partner; To create a world together that is the catalyst of creating a community; To bring together a group of like-minded people and create a space for them to feel like they belong. Today Arj√© is focused on women's and men's clothing, but ‚Äútomorrow‚Äù we will be a full lifestyle brand, offering kids clothes, homeware and more. Arj√© will be a place you can live in, sleep in, eat in, and feel complete in. And this is truly why I wanted to launch a brand with my partner and husband in life to create a new language of living for people to belong to.
 Olivia Munn's essay against Fug Girls conveys a problematic message.  In the midst of yet another chaotic news cycle, Olivia Munn has written a short essay on one of the most important issues currently plaguing civilization: fashion critics calling out bad outfits. The actress denounced Heather Cocks and Jessica Morgan of the tongue-in-cheek blog, Go Fug Yourself, for their reviews of celebrity red carpet looks. But the essay that was meant to take a powerful stand quickly turned into a problematic take.  A short essay on the ugly behaviors of the @fuggirls pic.twitter.com/KfZ5ambMQM In her piece, Munn references the Fug Girls‚Äô criticism of her outfit‚Äîa Peter Pilotto pantsuit‚Äîat the Apex for Youth awards, which they described as "like she got roped into making a sequel to American Hustle that ended up going straight to on-demand." Munn condemns Cocks and Morgan for ‚Äúsnarkiness‚Äù and ‚Äúhypocrisy,‚Äù claiming their work is ‚Äúplaying a part in the suppression of women.‚Äù It should be noted that being snarky and actively suppressing women are two very different things. Criticizing an outfit is not the same as criticizing the person wearing it. Making a joke about a woman's outfit is not an attack on her character, ideas, or her work. You can be a good person and still wear a bad dress. It is not sexist (Go Fug Yourself also reviews men's fashion) and truthfully, it is not that serious. We're talking about clothing that costs thousands of dollars here! It's just fashun, it's okay to laugh.  Still, mostly thanks to the 2016 presidential election, the media has undergone a reckoning of sorts around the toxic and often sexist rhetoric used to describe women. Since then, small steps of progress have been made. Using the words "plus-size" to describe a woman's body is no longer acceptable, and attacking women based on their looks is not a valid form of criticism, whether you're talking about a politician, a celebrity, or a model. But the concept of railing against criticism of one's fashion choices is, however, arguably quite Trumpian. During a week when several celebrities, including Lizzo and Ariana Grande, are attacking critics for honest album reviews, it's especially important to remember that no one's art‚Äîwhether music or fashion‚Äîshould be put on a pedestal and immune from criticism. Fashion, like music, painting, and film, is a form of art. Critics provide deeper insight and analysis, along with cultural connections, to a piece of art‚Äîand have been since the dawn of the written word. It's especially important to sustain and advocate for fashion criticism, as fashion is an industry innately responsive to cultural events and the current state of the world.   "No one's art‚Äîwhether music or fashion‚Äîshould be put on a pedestal and immune from criticism." Not only is it boring to pretend everyone looks wonderful and amazing on the red carpet, but Munn's statement sets a precedent for not critiquing people, ever. These are wealthy celebrities wearing designer clothing at public events; the folks at home reviewing their outfit choices isn't what's holding back the feminist movement. Of all the things happening in the world, please let us at least make a joke about your crazy designer dress as a form of entertainment.  What's more is that Munn went as far to compare the Fug Girls' fashion reviews to that of teenage boys who were caught objectifying girls by ranking them with a "point system." Comparing celebrities wearing designer clothing selected by their stylists to teenage boys sexually objectifying girls is not only inaccurate, but offensive and dangerous. It completely undermines the severity of rape culture; victims of sexual assault should not be compared to victims of red carpet reviews.  It should also be noted that Cocks and Morgan, who have been running their blog since the early 2000s, make a point to never body-shame women or comment on a woman's appearance (which is something that's not okay when critiquing fashion). To Munn's credit, however, there are several large-scale tabloids and websites that critique celebrity fashion in the toxic ways she suggests, but here, Munn opted to target a smaller-scale website‚Äîa skewed power imbalance that the likes of Tom and Lorenzo called "irresponsible" in a tweet explaining: "This appears to be the week celebrities with enormous social media followings punch down and single out their critics for harassment. Let's not be coy. Olivia Munn knows exactly what kind of week the @FugGirls are going to have thanks to this." This appears to be the week celebrities with enormous social media followings punch down and single out their critics for harassment. Let's not be coy. Olivia Munn knows exactly what kind of week the @FugGirls are going to have thanks to this. This is irresponsible. ‚ù§Ô∏è you, J+H https://t.co/44szBT1PFP In the past, Munn has used her voice and platform to advocate for important issues such as equal pay and sexual harassment as part of the Time's Up movement in Hollywood. Trying to stop fashion critics from reviewing her red carpet outfits is not an inspiring or worthy cause to add to the list. 
  From bootcut to black, they can't live without them. Like the LBD and trench, denim holds a special place in our hearts‚Äîand closets. Always present, but constantly evolving as we develop our own personal style, jeans are the fundamental wardrobe staple we trust to make us look and feel our best.  Our BAZAAR editors get up close and personal sharing their favorite styles from NYDJ, because when it comes to denim and fit, BAZAAR knows best. Soft, lightweight, and constructed with NYDJ‚Äôs Sure Stretch¬Æ fabric, this slim silhouette molds and moves with your body for maximum comfort. The bootcut style is designed with NYDJ's exclusive Lift Tuck¬Æ technology‚Äîflattening and tucking in the front and lifting and shaping in the back.
 Inspirations, personal style and global influences. With simple, flattering silhouettes paired with vibrant prints and unique details, it‚Äôs no wonder Saloni has garnered an It-girl following since its launch in 2011.   What inspired the Fall collection?The starting point for Fall was a portrait of Anna May Wong which I discovered at Atelier Gutenberg. The delicate romanticism and the balance between modernity and traditionalism of the Qipao dress she wears was truly inspiring. Global influence? I split my time among London and Hong Kong, India and Korea. I used to think this worked against me, but I now think it has been beneficial for the design process and inspired me to explore, discover and blend other cultures and aesthetics through our collections. Saloni‚Äôs strengths?My Indian heritage is always at the forefront of my designs, but I try to not translate it literally. I think that the brand‚Äôs celebration of bold colors and patterns is our way of bringing the spirit of India into the pieces. Favorite style icons? I mostly draw inspiration from the women around me. However, if I must choose my favorite style icon it would be Maharani Gayatri Devi, for her subtle elegance. Memorable fashion moment? I shot a short film based on Jacqueline Kennedy‚Äôs 1962 tour to India. Mixing film and fashion was incredibly satisfying.   Style philosophy? Enjoy fashion, but don‚Äôt be obsessed by it.  loving the ‚òÄÔ∏èüòé week in #hongkong A post shared by  Saloni Lodha (@salonilodha) on Sep 29, 2015 at 12:41am PDT  Inspirations? My family is originally from Rajasthan, India so I am energized by colors, patterns and classic femininity. Your beauty routine?I start with my favorite cleanser, then hydrating serums and boosters followed by tinted-moisturizer for a healthy glow. I finish it all off with bright red lips. Describe a typical weekend for you.I usually start the weekend off with an early morning hike on the ‚ÄúWilson Trail‚Äù followed by a swim and Dim sum at a club in Wong Chuk Hang.

 Meet the next generation of DVF.  Diane von Furstenberg is keeping it all in the family to usher in the next wave of her eponymous fashion house.  Yesterday, DVF's Fall 2018 presentation marked the brand's first collection since Jonathan Saunders left his role as creative director last fall. Since then, Nathan Jenden has been appointed as DVF's new creative director, a position he previously filled from 2001 to 2010. For his return, Jenden looked towards the future generation of DVF: Talita von Furstenberg, the 18-year-old granddaughter of Diane von Furstenberg.   Before unveiling the new collection, Diane shared a story about Talita's first time working with the brand when she was just 9 years old. "10 years ago we showed during PITTI in Florence. We showed in the largest private garden and spent a week in that beautiful villa. My granddaughter Talita was 9 and asked to come along. I agreed but told her she would have to work! She did.,, [sic] helped with every detail and we had had a great time. A decade later, Nathan and i [sic] invited to be our muse. She shot all day and is a pro," the designer wrote on Instagram.    Now starring as the new muse of the DVF brand, Talita models the Fall 2018 collection in a lookbook of images. Featuring a new take on DVF's iconic prints, the 18-year-old wears a bright yellow leopard dress in one image, a retro '70s-inspired jumpsuit in another, and an updated version of the brand's classic wrap dress. "The spirit of DVF and its emotional connection to women is more relevant today than ever before," Jenden said of the brand's shoot with Talita, "DVF and TVF are both inspirational women across generations‚Äîbeautiful, brave, and ready for anything."  As for the future of the fashion house, its spirit of female empowerment feels timelier now than ever. And casting Diane's granddaughter as the new face of the brand only further cements DVF's relevance amongst the next generation of women. Let it be known: this is just the beginning for Talita von Furstenberg.   
 Your new favorite summer sandals are here.  First we fell in love with their floral dresses, then their denim, and now, Reformation is launching its first-ever shoe collection‚Äîand you're going to want every pair for summer.  From barely-there lace-up sandals to block heel mules and espadrilles, the brand's foray into footwear is filled with all the sandals on your wish-list this season. Ref's debut shoe collection includes 11 styles ranging from $128 to $218 in price. There are some '90s-esque styles like heeled thong sandals and this season's naked sandal trend along with classic summer staples like espadrille wedges.  And much like Reformation's apparel, its shoes are sustainable too. The designs are all made with eco-friendly materials like chrome-free leather and jute‚Äîmeaning compared to most shoes bought in the U.S., they save an average of 52% CO2 emissions, 70% water, and 65% waste. So if you're looking for a sustainable shoe alternative to replace your fast fashion habit, this is it without breaking the bank.    Reformation revealed shoes have been its number one requested item amongst customers‚Äîbut footwear isn't the only new product offering its launched this season. Earlier this spring, the eco-conscious brand launched a permanent collection of extended curve sizes ranging from sizes 1x to 3x and 14 to 24. And just before that, it introduced its first collection of (semi) sustainable swimwear including bikinis and one-piece swimsuits. Consider it the summer of Reformation.  
 The #GucciChallenge is here! When Gucci debuted its Fall 2018 collection, the world was surprised to see models carrying dragons and replicas of their own heads down the runway.  Gucci's Milan show was curiously dubbed the "Cyborg Manifesto" and was set in an extremely clinical, turquoise operating room. As Gucci's Twitter account explained, "The concept of the operating room reflects the work of a designer‚Äîthe act of cutting, splicing, and reconstructing materials and fabrics to create a new personality and identity with them." Needless to say, the surprising concept had a major impact on the show's audience, and people all over the world. Gucci's influence is no more evident than on social media, whereby people have started recreating the severed head looks along with the hashtag #GucciChallenge. Started by Instagram's director of fashion partnerships, Eva Chen, the craze soon took off. Here are some the best reactions so far to Gucci's unforgettable Milan runway:  #GucciChallenge  new Clutch‚ù§Ô∏è @gucci  @mafarnsimon ÊàëÂìãÂÖà‰øÇfashion monsterÂëÄüòÜ #gucciÊáâË©≤ÊêµÊàëÂìãË°åÈ®∑ #fashionÂòÖÂò¢‰Ω†Ë≠òÊ¢ùÈêµÂí©  #gucci #fashion #fashionmonster #style #clutch #clutchbag #fashionist #fashionable #fashionista #fashionicon #stylefashion #stylediary #styleblogger #yufiyip #styleguide #goodvibes #friends #chok #ÊôÇÂ∞öÁ©øÊê≠ #ÊôÇÂ∞öÈÄ†Âûã #ÊôÇË£ùÊÄ™Áç∏ A post shared by  YUFI (@yufiyip) on Feb 24, 2018 at 3:03am PST  @Barbie nailed it ‚ú®#guccichallenge A post shared by  Robert Best (@robhbest) on Feb 23, 2018 at 4:25pm PST  Entendedores entender√£o.  #guccichallenge A post shared by  Al√¥?

 Linda Evangelista recalls the dress that she'll never forget.  I wore this John Galliano for Dior dress on the January 1995 cover of Harper's Bazaar. The cover was shot by Patrick Demarchelier at his studio in New York, and we pretty much replicated the look from the Galliano show in Paris but without the veil. At the time I was modeling full-time, living between L.A. and New York, and traveling a lot to Europe, so it was hectic. But I loved my life‚Äîloved it. I absolutely adored my job, and I‚Äôve always said that it‚Äôs a dream to do what I do for a living. I don‚Äôt remember that much from back then; everything is fuzzy. The best person to speak to about those days is Naomi [Campbell]. She remembers everything right down to the detail. Call her. But I do remember the fitting for the Galliano show. When I saw this dress on the rack being wheeled in, I started hyperventilating. Early on I learned not to have any expectations, as you don‚Äôt always get the best dress or the best look in the show. And you don‚Äôt always get to open or close the show, so closing was an honor. I couldn‚Äôt have imagined a more beautiful dress. I‚Äôm not even a yellow person, but wearing this was one of the most sensational things that has ever happened to me. I loved everything about it. It was sophisticated, it was flirty, it was fun. It was retro, it was modern. I do love a full-on gown where you get to see the ankle. It had every element for me. I also loved the show and the energy. It was a very exciting moment in fashion, and the audience was just as excited. I didn‚Äôt know it was going to be like that, but when I walked out and felt that energy it was magical.               It was so nice when Bazaar asked me to do the cover, as I did feel like this was my dress. I would‚Äôve been sad to see someone else wearing it. I see girls now, if they go to Disneyland or at Halloween, they want to be a princess or dress as the fairy-tale movie heroine of the moment; for me, this was like, ‚ÄúOh, my God, this is a fairy-tale dress, and I get to wear it on the cover of and take it to the next level.‚Äù  Before this dress I had never owned any couture. Karl [Lagerfeld] had given me some Chanel things, but I never had a couture gown. John gave it to me. I don‚Äôt remember exactly how it went down, but it was shipped to me. The thing took up a lot of square footage. It was tremendous, and I never knew where to put it, so it ended up in my bedroom on a mannequin. But it made me so happy because every morning when I woke up, the first thing I saw was this joyful, sunshiny-yellow dress. I had it for years, and then it started to look like maybe it was too fragile to be exposed. I thought, ‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôm going to box it up,‚Äù and then I thought, ‚ÄúWhat am I going to do with it?‚Äù So I gave it to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. It‚Äôll find its show one day. That‚Äôs the thing about John‚Äîhe goes full-on, full force, and I find his vision entertaining. I always look forward to discovering whatever trip he‚Äôs on. He always has a story for you. When you go to your fitting, he explains to you who you are, where you‚Äôve been, and how you‚Äôve ended up where you are wearing this dress. I remember this cover shoot being the easiest shoot in the world. Whenever I was told, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre shooting with Patrick,‚Äù I would always be like, ‚ÄúYes!‚Äù I can‚Äôt imagine a more pleasant, fun, and wonderful environment to be in for work. He doesn‚Äôt have to do much because he‚Äôs Patrick. He doesn‚Äôt torture you. It‚Äôs not a struggle. Sometimes one has to go through a lot of pain to get their photos, but Patrick just makes everything easy. But then I‚Äôve always adored fashion. I don‚Äôt have a favorite; I love it all, from beautiful gowns to vintage dresses to men‚Äôs suits and androgynous stuff. And I love super-feminine pieces. But I don‚Äôt have as many clothes as one might imagine, as I wear my things more than once. I don‚Äôt wear them as a photo opportunity; I don‚Äôt wear them for my followers. I wear them because that‚Äôs how I dress in life.  What I love most about fashion, especially when it comes to a heavenly gown like this one, is that it can touch you emotionally and transport you back to a place in time. It means so much more than just something on a hanger. The iconic Linda Evangelista is the muse for all seasons. She closed the show in this dress, one of my favorite moments ever. She owned it, she slayed it, and I have since been told it was a ‚Äúfashion moment‚Äù‚Äîmy first! This collection was inspired by the exotic exploits of Misia Sert [the Russian-born pianist and close friend of Coco Chanel who held lavish parties at her Paris salon at the height of the Roaring ‚Äô20s], and as Linda carved her way through the crowds, no one else existed. Jaws dropped. The audience looked on in awe, but they could only dream. Linda commanded her space like no other. The creative process spontaneously kicked in as it always does with Evangelista. She was in character, melting onto a rusty soldier‚Äôs unmade bed surrounded by salty sailors from an imaginary port, and there you have it, the image, captured forever for all to see. The feathers on the bustier were hand-dyed to match the early-morning dew on buttercups, a golden glow only she can work, and she did. Her freshly peroxided hair was a platinum memory of a bygone glamour. Linda, a dear and caring friend, owns this dress. She slept with it at the end of her bed, and I cannot begin to tell you what this means to me. This article originally appears in the November 2017 issue, available on newsstands October 24.
 She brought Kanye West's "Fade" video to the runway. Teyana Taylor might be best known for starring in the music video for Kanye West's "Fade," but the singer and model has caused quite a stir at New York Fashion Week. Her runway walk for streetwear brand GCDS was totally fierce, and showcased just how multi-faceted she is. But her performance at Philipp Plein was like nothing else so far. Taking to the stage while Future performed, Taylor proved that she's an incredible dancer, and she posted a video of her performance on Instagram:  In response to apparent criticism she'd received for walking in Fashion Week, Taylor wrote: "When the haters tried to say I was too extra yesterday.....ü§î I turned around and CLOSED ANOTHER RUNWAY SHOW even more EXTRA!!"  Taylor's performance was a total show-stopper, and unsurprisingly, had the full attention of the audience: Unforgettable.
 The Stockholm-based fashion house is selling handpicked classics for crazy-low prices. Acne Studios fans, mark your calendars. Tomorrow, the Stockholm-based fashion house is scheduled to launch a limited-time online pop-up site‚Äîwhere you can shop handpicked pieces from the coveted fashion label's past collections, priced way below retail.  This Tuesday, April 24th, at exactly 10am EST, Acne Studios will open AcneArchive.com, a fleeting online outlet selling exclusive archived Acne-brand picks to U.S. shoppers, for up to 75% off retail price. The big catch? The site will be shut down just 48-hours after it goes live, meaning you'll have to get your shopping done before the strike of 10am, on Thursday, April 26th‚Äîunless you plan a trip to the Scandinavian city and visit the brick and mortar outlet. Sifting back through the beloved European label's prolific archives, tomorrow's flash-sale promises to offer some of the most iconic old-school Acne Studios pieces from seasons past. From one-of-a-kind matching sets and flirty printed flared culottes, to more versatile staples like black leather moto jackets and oversized blazers‚Äîthe pop-up will be offering a vast array of vintage finds to update your spring wardrobe, without spending off-the-runway prices. Adding to the appeal, the outlet will also feature a full-range of timeless Acne accessories, including shoes, shades, bags, scarves, and jewelry.  So, if you're looking to infuse some fashion girl favorite designer styles into your closet without maxing out your credit card, we'd highly recommend bookmarking the Acne Archives outlet and shopping the limited-time discounted pieces as soon as the site goes live. Because if we known anything about Acne's loyal U.S. following‚Äîeven the pieces from season's past will be quick to sell out. 
 How to dress like the Duchess of Sussex this Halloween‚Äîand beyond.  The Duchess of Sussex always provides us with chic workwear ensembles, beauty inspiration, and hair glossiness for days, so it's no surprise that many will want to dress up as her this Halloween. Whether you're looking for a reason to add some chic and wearable pieces to your wardrobe this fall, or you're simply a die-hard fan of this royal beauty, this is how to dress like Meghan Markle for Halloween‚Äîluxury included.  If you get one thing down for your Meghan Markle Halloween costume, make sure it's the hat. From berets and fedoras to wool bubble caps and fascinators, this statement accessory is a key piece in her royal wardrobe.  This¬†wool felt velour hat by Philip Treacy will make your costume apparent at first glance, especially when paired with a neutral trench.¬† When it comes to wool hats, the wider the better. Meghan's go-to fall accessory comes in varying neutral hues, like this one from cult-favorite brand Lack of Color.¬† Another signature hat look comes in the form of the panama hat. This lightweight, breathable style is handwoven from vacation-ready straw, just like the ones Meghan has been spotted wearing time and time again.¬† Channel one of Meghan's more daring dress ensembles‚Äîthe little black tuxedo dress she wore to attend a Hamilton viewing with Prince Harry. Just wear your hair in a low, parted bun and add black pumps. With a modern construction and modest details, this little blazer dress gets the look just right.¬† The Duchess is a fan of feminine, A-line silhouettes that feature minimal constructions and midi lengths. She typically opts for more modernized pieces that can be worn for a variety of occasions.  You can't go wrong with a classic crepe midi dress, especially one that comes in this feminine polka-dotted iteration.

You can¬†wear it to work the next morning.¬† A trench coat is always a royal go-to, and this modernized version is no different. It's belted and layered for extra warmth on your fun evening out.¬†¬† If there's one thing princesses, duchesses and queens love, it's the double-breasted¬†boucl√© coat. If you don't want to wear a full-on coat, opt for a blazer instead. The duchess loves to throw a neutral blazer over tailored shirts and sophisticated midi dresses, preferably in a classic cut. On the bottom, she opts for walkable, feminine heels with classic construction.  This classic cut iteration from Nili Lotan is crafted in lightweight linen, ideal for layering over a Meghan-like silk dress or A-line skirt.¬† The Duchess of Sussex loves an elegant blazer, so add this to your cart before the holiday and continue to wear it all fall and winter long.¬† Although you'd be using this for a Halloween costume, the styling options for afterwards are endless.

 The Off-White designer kept a close eye on these looks from Diana's closet for his Spring 2018 show. Virgil Abloh took the "people's princess" to the street last night in Paris at his Spring 2018 runway show, just four weeks after the 20th anniversary of Princess Diana's death. The collection was the most formal riff on streetwear Abloh has shown yet, and rightly so‚Äìgiven that it was inspired by an iconic royal wardrobe. Off-White's designer and his team sorted through countless images of the princess, looking to reinvent her wardrobe for today's fashion climate, and we spotted just the looks they sought inspiration from. Here, all the Off-White odes and updates to Princess Di's best looks‚Äîand what Virgil Abloh would fill her closet with if she were with us and on the style circuit today. Princess Diana often wore suiting to royal duties and daytime family affairs, but Off-White gave her '80s suits an update with a more fitted silhouette, a cascading asymmetrical pleat, a wider windowpane plaid and gutsier extras.   Abloh adapted Diana's geometric and bold prints; from ladylike separates paired with conservatively-shaped skirts, to easy-to-wear elegant pieces, to jeans, minis, knee-length shorts (another one of his Diana-isms) and thigh-high boots.   Diana often wore pastel sets paired with pillboxes for cocktail attire, but Abloh imagined the modern day Diana sporting shorter hemlines‚Äîand tennis shoes for evening. For added je ne sais quoi, Off-White's pink suit (and his pastel blue version, below) strutted the runway with a pair of heels in hand instead of a purse. Diana wore white for black die, daytime and casual weekend activities, but for Off-White's finale, Virgil Abloh decked Naomi Campbell in an amazing ivory evening coat, paired with cycling shorts and a sexy lace-up, perspex-covered heel. This was Princess Di 2.0 at its finest, pairing her activewear with inspiration from her most stately of looks and daring accessories. Diana wasn't afraid of color‚Äîand it doesn't seem the Off-White girl is afraid of much at all. For Spring 2018, a modern day Di wears these brightly-toned frocks with a strings of pearls and futuristic over-the-knee boots.   Hemlines went higher, and in some cases, lower. Footwear went both super-sexy and easygoing athletic. For Virgil Abloh, a modern day Diana takes notes from her style heyday, and isn't afraid to mix her easy weekend attire with her black tie wardrobe.

Since then, she has not only worked with Donatella Versace, but designers like Tom Ford, Zuhair Murad, and Balmain to craft her signature look over the years.  The 2019 CFDA Awards will be held at the Brooklyn Museum on June 3. Along with J.Lo, Carine Roitfeld (editor, stylist, and Harper's Bazaar's global fashion director) is also being honored at this year's ceremony with The Founder's Award. Brandon Maxwell, Marc Jacobs, Rosie Assoulin, Kate and Laura Mulleavy (Rodarte), Virgil Abloh (Off-White), and Kerby Jean-Raymond (Pyer Moss) are among the designers nominated for CFDA Awards this year. British designer Sarah Burton will receive the prestigious International Award for her work at Alexander McQueen.

 The revolutionary fashion photographer died yesterday at the age of 74.  There is a good chance that if you're looking at a photo of a supermodel during the height of the '90s, you're looking at the handiwork of Peter Lindbergh. The fashion photographer, who revolutionized contemporary fashion's understanding of the supermodel, died in Paris yesterday. He was 74 years old.  Known for his unretouched, black-and-white, and cinematic portraits, Lindbergh has worked with the likes of Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, Christy Turlington, and Cindy Crawford, creating iconic photos that have graced the covers of venerable fashion magazines everywhere, including our own. Most recently, Lindbergh worked with Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, to shoot the September issue of British Vogue.  Today, models took to Instagram to honor the late photographer and the fashion legacy he left behind.  "Broken Beyond Words," Campbell wrote, captioning a selfie of her and Lindbergh. "@therealpeterlindbergh your vitality , your animated Smile ... your kindness and generosity of giving me your home in Paris while mine was being put together !!

 One thing people may not realize about Kate Spade‚Äôs new creative director, Nicola Glass: That doppelgaÃànger in the front row is her identical twin. Here, she opens up about hijinks with her sister and her first fashion show for the brand.  After Kate Spade's Spring 2019 show‚Äîthe brand‚Äôs first ever‚Äîguests rushed across the pale pink runway to congratulate a slim Northern Irish woman with icy blue eyes and a sleek blonde bob. They did so in the mistaken belief that she was the new creative director, Nicola Glass, a Gucci and Michael Kors alum who had been tapped to head the Tapestry-owned label in November 2017. Only it wasn‚Äôt Glass. It was Tara Barwick, Glass‚Äôs twin, a London-based radiologist who had flown in for her sister‚Äôs debut. Well-wishers could be forgiven for the mix-up. Physically, the two are identical save for their coifs‚ÄîBarwick has a classic chop, while Glass sports a cheeky buzzed undercut.‚ÄúI felt like we were back at university in Edinburgh,‚Äù Barwick said the following day.‚ÄúNow that we live on different continents, that doesn‚Äôt happen too much.‚Äù In their teens and 20s, the sisters, now 46, relished the confusion, playing tricks on boyfriends, swapping high school classes, and generally perplexing people. Early in her medical career, Barwick recalls, she treated a urology patient who squirmed in her presence.‚ÄúHe was behaving really strangely, and after I examined him he told me I looked a lot like someone he knew,‚Äùshe says. It turned out he was someone Nicola knew from art school.  ‚ÄúWhat I do makes people happy. It brings them joy.‚Äù  Another time Glass pretended to be Barwick during an interview for a summer job. ‚ÄúIt was to be a Coca-Cola promotion girl,‚Äù Glass says. ‚ÄúI was home from college before Tara, and I‚Äôd gotten her the job, but there was a training day and she still wasn‚Äôt back. I was like,‚ÄòI don‚Äôt think I can train for you too!‚Äô‚Äù But for the sisters, who come from a family of M.D.‚Äôs (their brother is also a radiologist, as was their late father), their relationship hasn‚Äôt been just high jinks and switcheroos. ‚ÄúNicola is my best friend,‚Äù Barwick says.‚ÄúShe‚Äôs been my support system.‚Äù Adds Glass, ‚ÄúTara always keeps me grounded and encourages me. My career path was quite winding, and there were times when I doubted that I was doing the right thing. I went through a phase when I would look at what Tara was doing and I would see all this worth because she‚Äôs saving people‚Äôs lives. I would ask what I was adding to the universe, but I‚Äôve realized that what I do makes people happy. It brings them joy.‚Äù There was plenty of joy in Glass‚Äôs first Kate Spade outing, from the surrealist twists (lips at the center of abstract florals, a matchstick zipper pull) to the candy-colored palette and playful flourishes, like off center bows and subtle ruffles. These expressive, optimistic looks were rooted, Glass says, in the late founder‚Äôs vision.   Kate Spade, the trailblazing Midwesterner who launched her brand with accessible yet luxurious nylon handbags in 1993, left the company in 2007, and died tragically last June. At the spring show, a touching note placed on each guest‚Äôs seat paid tribute to her memory. ‚ÄúShe left a little sparkle everywhere she went,‚Äù it read. The catwalk was dusted with glitter, a nod to Spade‚Äôs enduring shimmer, which was threaded throughout Glass‚Äôs collection. ‚ÄúMy starting point was thinking about the brand‚Äôs core DNA,‚Äù says Glass. ‚ÄúI felt I‚Äôd honored her because she was the one who inspired me.‚Äù   ‚ÄúThe Nicola is my 						go-to bag. Deep evergreen is the new black!‚Äù ‚ÄúI like a slimmer, easy						shape‚Äîwith a ruffle.‚Äù ‚ÄúKnee-high lilac boots add a beautiful pop of color.‚Äù Glass succeeded not only in honoring Spade‚Äôs legacy but also in modernizing the brand, proposing fluid silhouettes, lots of pattern, and an understated sensuality via cutout details and liquid satin fabrics. She evolved the novelty the label is known for into something quieter and more nuanced, for instance, Glass‚Äôs Nicola Twistlock handbag features a heart-shaped lock that transforms into a spade when opened. Most important, Glass has embraced the whimsical spirit that Spade so loved. ‚ÄúShe encouraged women to have fun and express themselves with fashion and create their own identity,‚Äù Glass says.‚ÄúShe didn‚Äôt want fashion to feel intimidating, and I really liked that idea.‚Äù Glass will extend these codes into the Kate Spade home range (e.g., colorful Perspex wine stoppers that match the heel of a spring shoe) as well as the imagery. Photographer Tim Walker, whose dreamy ads for the label were one of Glass‚Äôs key inspirations, shot the spring campaign.   Barwick was impressed by her sister‚Äôs freshman collection.‚ÄúI‚Äôve always known that Nicola was talented, but when she walked out at the end of the show I was like, ‚ÄòWow!‚Äô I was so proud of her,‚Äùshe says. ‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôs so wearable,‚Äù adds Barwick, listing the cropped button-front denim and intarsia knit sweaters among her favorite pieces. She was also a fan of the Nicola shoulder bag, whose soft, feminine details balance the strong, graphic silhouette. But where, pray tell, is the Tara bag? ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll design one,‚Äù promises Glass. ‚ÄúAn oversize bucket fits my tablet, documents, and other essentials.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôll wear this dress with a blazer to work, but it would look equally great for a party.‚Äù ‚ÄúThese block-heel sandals are gorgeous and super comfy.‚Äù This article originally appears in the February 2019 issue of Harper's BAZAAR, available on newsstands now.

 Add this to the list of items you never knew you needed. If you think you might be in need of New Year's fitness motivation, perhaps Dior has just the stylish thing to spur you on. Dior Homme has created its first ever BMX bike via a collaboration with Parisian company Bogarde. The chrome-tinted, limited-edition bike comes in the brand's black and red house colors and the logo is printed on the handlebars and metalwork. Only 70 of the bikes will be produced, retailing at $3,200, and available upon request at selected Dior Homme stores from December 7. News of the project was first teased by creative director Kris Van Assche back in October.  COMING SOON @DIORHOMME  #HARDIOR  #diorhomme #krisdior #krisvanassche #kris_van_assche #bmx A post shared by @ kris_van_assche on Oct 25, 2017 at 1:25am PDT The label's take on the item was inspired by 90s' street culture‚Äîa theme that often dominates Dior's menswear collections. Patrick Demarchelier was enlisted to shoot the launch campaign, a moody black and white shot where a model poses on the bike.

 This marks the creative director's first piece for the French fashion house. While visiting Paris, Lady Gaga took a trip to the Louvre yesterday looking like a walking piece of art. Despite it being nearly 70 degrees in the French capital, the singer committed to a dramatic all-black leather look for her visit to the museum. But along with her floor-length, Matrix-inspired Alaia coat and Ray-Ban sunglasses, Gaga's ensemble featured one very important accessory: the new, never-before-seen C√©line bag.  The bag, as Business of Fashion confirms, is Hedi Slimane's first design for C√©line. It's slated to hit the runway as part of his inaugural collection for the brand during Paris Fashion Week next month. Slimane was announced as the new artistic, creative, and image director of the French fashion house back in February, succeeding Phoebe Philo.  A post shared by Lady Gaga (@ladygaga) on Aug 30, 2018 at 4:48am PDT "Oh, this old thing?" Giving it a grand debut, Gaga whipped her new C√©line bag all around Paris‚Äîfrom the Louvre to her hotel balcony, serving us angles and LEWKS all along the way. The structured bag is personalized with her initials (L.G.) and features gold clasp detailing.   A post shared by Lady Gaga (@ladygaga) on Aug 30, 2018 at 4:48am PDT  This isn't the first time Lady Gaga has debuted Hedi Slimane's designs, though. In 2012, the "Born This Way" singer was the first to wear Slimane's inaugural collection for Saint Laurent just a week after it hit the runway. Hopefully this means we can expect to see Gaga cheering on Slimane from the front row at C√©line this Paris Fashion Week.  But if not, she's currently giving us her own Paris Fashion Week while there now:  In a red, ladylike look on Monday. In a metallic blue Nicolas Jebran jacket and Naked Wardrobe shorts on Tuesday. And carrying the new C√©line bag out of the Louvre today.

 Paris Fashion Week meets the Upside Down. Louis Vuitton gave a nod to the Upside Down today when the brand presented a Stranger Things graphic tee with its Spring 2018 collection at Paris Fashion Week.  The top is a classic, black oversized T-shirt featuring one of the show‚Äôs new posters for Season 2, which were fashioned after iconic ‚Äò70s and ‚Äò80s movie posters. (This one is inspired by Stand By Me.) On the shirt, the show‚Äôs leading quartet of boys‚ÄîWill (Noah Schnapps), Mike (Finn Wolfhard), Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin), and Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo)‚Äîmake an appearance on an eerie design. The piece, which includes a chain detail at the neckline, was layered over a bohemian floral blouse and baby pink ruffled pants. It also marked the only graphic tee in the entire Vuitton show; creative director Nicolas Ghesqui√®re's way of injecting youthful, sci-fi fantasy in a collection of otherwise billowy silhouettes, sequined dresses, ruffled accents, and embellished overcoats.  However, this isn't the only time Vuitton crossed paths with Stranger Things. A year ago, three stars from the show‚ÄîMcLaughlin, Matarazzo, and fashion's new favorite, Millie Bobby Brown‚Äîvisited Ghesqui√®re in the City of Lights. The tweenage trio took a tour of the brand's headquarters just before Paris Fashion Week.   GOT STRANGERS IN THE HOUSE TODAY @strangerthingstv @netflix @netflixfr @milliebobby_brown @therealcalebmclaughlin @gatenm123 @louisvuitton #strangerthings #netflix A post shared by @ nicolasghesquiere on Sep 23, 2016 at 4:47am PDT  We have a feeling the designer will be binging Season 2 like the rest of us once the sci-fi hit returns to Netflix on October 27.
 From New York to Paris, what the runways looked like before social media.  In the era of Instagram, we've all become accustomed to what Fashion Week looks like, whether you're physically at the shows or not. But long before the front row was filled with iPhones, runway shows looked a lot different. From the first ever New York Fashion Week in 1943 to small shows held in designer's ateliers to the golden age of supermodels in the '80s and '90s, we're taking a look back at the evolution of Fashion Week over the last six decades. Here's what the runway looked like before social media took over. A model wears a slit evening gown by Jo Copeland at the first ever New York Fashion Week.  With the end of WWII in sight, service girls get a glimpse of their peace-time fashions with a Spooner and Co. Ltd. runway show full of  bridal gowns and evening attire. Models walk the runway in a mix of evening gowns and tailored daywear as a room of fashion buyers watches on.  A woman models a mink coat as a group of fashion buyers and editors look on.  A model walks the runway in a two-piece skirt suit, a pair of gloves, and a stylish hat at the Pierre Balmain runway show in Sydney, Australia. A model walks the Christian Dior catwalk wearing a belted evening gown.  A model poses backstage showing off a floral hairpiece before hitting the runway.  Christian Dior poses with a group of models after his couture runway show in Paris.  At a Balmain runway show, a model carries a poodle down the runway to match her tailored blouse and trousers.  Models walk the runway wearing ball gowns and full-length gloves at the Third Italian High Fashion Show in Florence, Italy. A crowd of fashion editors and buyers packs into a Seventh Avenue showroom for a fashion show by Samuel Winston.  A model hits the runway wearing a one-piece swimsuit with pockets. Christian Dior flew 172 gowns, eight models, and three dressers from Paris to Scotland for a 1955 fashion show at a ballroom in Gleneagles that raised money for the Friends of France charity.  It was a tight crowd for buyers, editors, and photographers who packed into Maison Christian Dior in Paris for the designer's 1956 collection. Coco Chanel gives one of her designs a final look before presenting it as part of a 1957 show in Paris.  A trio of models wears swimsuits for a runway show in Paris.  A model demonstrates how to make an entrance while walking the runway at W.F. Adlmueller's fashion show in Vienna.

A model walks the runway at Mary Quant's show in London. The designer, who invented the mini skirt, went on to shape the Youthquake fashion of the '60s.  Pierre Cardin opted to present his collection on models at the 50th Paris Car Show.  Two models wear evening gowns by Yves Saint Laurent at the designer's show in Paris.  In the midst of the mod era of fashion, a model wears a mini stop sign dress and white boots at a runway show held in a Parisian hotel.  A British model shows the latest mod fashions from London to a crowd on the streets of New York City.  Twiggy fronts a runway show for her own namesake fashion brand of colorful Sixties designs.  The era of space takes over in a galactic, futuristic-themed runway show by Pierre Cardin.  A parade of models marches down the street in London. Twiggy leads a pack of models in matching outfits at a runway show.  Naked dresses make their way to the runway: model Kalio walks the Zandra Rhodes show in a sheer dress. Anjelica Huston strikes a pose on the catwalk at a show in the Seventies.

 The fashion designer celebrates her immigrant roots in her new role as fairy godmother of the Statue of Liberty Museum.  In 1976, Newsweek famously anointed Diane von Furstenberg ‚Äúthe most marketable woman since Coco Chanel.‚Äù Just six years after immigrating to New York from Belgium, von Furstenberg had sold more than five million of her signature wrap dresses, making hers a bona fide American success story. The dress came to symbolize power and independence for a generation of women. In the process, it helped establish its designer‚Äîa Jewish woman, n√©e Diane Halfin, who married and divorced a prince but kept his name‚Äîas a global luxury-lifestyle powerhouse whose brand is sold in more than 70 countries. As she steps down from her position as chairwoman of the Council of Fashion Designers of America in June, von Furstenberg is focusing on her new role as chair of the fund-raising campaign for the Statue of Liberty Museum, opening Wednesday. Here, she discusses the future of the museum with one of the top donors, her friend Mellody Hobson, an African-American businesswoman who is president of Ariel Investments and the former chairwoman of DreamWorks Animation. MELLODY HOBSON: You‚Äôre a Belgian immigrant and the daughter of a Holocaust survivor, so I imagine the Statue of Liberty has particular meaning for you. Can you tell me about that? DIANE VON FURSTENBERG: The first time I ever saw a picture of the Statue of Liberty was when I was a little girl. My parents were visiting New York and they sent me a postcard. So for me, she represented America. The first time I really saw her, I was 22 years old. I had just married Prince Egon von Furstenberg, and he was starting a bank job in New York. Egon flew over, but I chose to take the ship because I wanted to have some time to think about my future. MH: What was your reaction to seeing her? DVF: I was a privileged immigrant, but like anyone who leaves their homeland behind I carried my hopes and dreams. I had my son inside of me and my little dresses inside my luggage. I was going to try to sell them in America. We arrived at dawn. There was this big noise, and I looked up and there she was. That image is forever imprinted on my mind. MH: How did you come to lead the Statue of Liberty Museum fund-raising campaign? DVF: In 2013, I made a speech with the king of Belgium at the opening of the Red Star Line Museum in Antwerp. That museum commemorates a shipping company that ferried millions of immigrants to America in the late-18th and early-19th centuries, including Albert Einstein. At the event I met Stephen Briganti, the president and CEO of the Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation, and from that time on he was courting me to join his board. I was honored at the Ellis Island Family Heritage Awards two years later. MH: You were already pretty busy serving on the boards of the Shed and Vital Voices, not to mention being president and later chairwoman of the CFDA, and your day job as a designer. What convinced you to join?  DVF: I said, ‚ÄúIf I go on another board, my husband, [Barry Diller], is going to divorce me.‚Äù However, Stephen wasn‚Äôt letting me off that easy. He showed me a copy of my book The Woman I Wanted to Be, in which he‚Äôd underlined something my mother, who spent 13 months at Auschwitz, once wrote to me:  ‚ÄúGod has saved my life so that I can give you life. By giving you life, you gave me my life back. You are my torch, my flag of freedom.‚Äù The symbolism of her words was uncanny.     MH: Wow. What was your first task? DVF: They wanted me to raise $100 million for the Statue of Liberty Museum, which is being relocated from a cramped space inside her pedestal to a brand-new, 26,000-square-foot venue on Liberty Island. I don‚Äôt like to ask for money, but I said that I would try. With Edwin Schlossberg, the museum‚Äôs designer, I came up with the idea for an abstract ‚ÄúStars and Stripes‚Äù mural for the entrance. The stripes are iron bars from the Statue of Liberty‚Äôs original armature created by Gustave Eiffel. And I asked the sculptor Anh Duong to design 50 stars to sell to donors. MH: Why did you pick her? You know a lot of people in the art world. DVF: Because she is a French-Vietnamese immigrant, she is my friend, and I love her work. So she designed these beautiful stars, and I started making calls. I have to say that this was the easiest thing I‚Äôve ever done. ‚ÄúThe first time I really saw the Statue of Liberty ... I had my son inside of me and my little dresses inside my luggage. I was going to try to sell them in America.‚Äù MH: It wasn‚Äôt hard to convince people to pay $2 million for a star? DVF: Well, I got it from you pretty fast! The first star I sold was to Michael Bloomberg. Mike‚Äôs the best person to start with because he always says yes. Then I went to Jeff Bezos, and he said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to get one to honor my stepfather, who emigrated from Cuba.‚Äù From there I went to Chanel, Ralph Lauren, Disney, Coca-Cola, and other corporate partners. MH: Why do you think it was so simple?  DVF: There‚Äôs something magical about the Statute of Liberty: She belongs to everybody. Why did you agree to participate? MH: My husband, George [Lucas], and I wanted to be sure that there was a person of color on the wall, so we named ours for Muhammad Ali. We felt very strongly that there couldn‚Äôt be an American flag without all of us being represented.  DVF: That‚Äôs true. There‚Äôs also an Oprah star. MH: Which is great. What values does the Statue of Liberty represent? DVF: She reminds us about the power of friendship between nations‚Äî MH: Countries? DVF: Yes, but not their leaders, their people. The Statue of Liberty was given to us by the people of France to commemorate the centennial of the American Revolution at a time when they were disappointed by their own political situation. The French Revolution started not long after the American Revolution, but the result was very different: the Terror, and then Napol√©on and the Second Empire. So the French looked to America as this utopic democracy.  MH: In the context of the current debates about immigration and displaced people, how important do you think the Statue of Liberty is today? DVF: I think she‚Äôs never been more relevant. Did you know, by the way, that the first model for the Statue of Liberty was actually an Arab girl? The French sculptor Fr√©d√©ric-Auguste Bartholdi began work on a monument to commemorate the opening of Egypt‚Äôs Suez Canal, but the project fell through. He recycled his prototype later when the Statue of Liberty commission came along. MH: How significant is it that the Statue of Liberty is a woman?  DVF: She has broken chains at her feet, but she is strong and she is the light. The message is important: Women‚Äôs voices can save humanity. Ironically, no women were invited to attend the statue‚Äôs opening in 1886. Suffragists chartered a boat to circle the island during the unveiling. MH: What do you want people to take away from a visit to the museum? DVF: The importance of liberty and the importance of freedom. The museum is directly across from Ellis Island, so it‚Äôs also about the importance of welcoming people. MH: This project was an ambitious one, but you made it look so easy. For the woman who‚Äôs done it all, what‚Äôs next? DVF: After coming to New York City, I was lucky and privileged to become the woman I wanted to be. Now that I‚Äôm older, I would like to spend the rest of my life using my voice, my knowledge, my connections‚Äîanything I have‚Äîto help all women become the women they want to be.

 A few tricks on how to wear the classic accessory like a fashion editor.  The right scarf, with the perfect print and a luxe silky texture, can transform any ensemble‚Äìadding a bit of vintage-inspired sophistication and detail. Legacy fashion houses have issued their signature prints in the form of scarves for decades, creating a timeless accessory in the process. But, how are all the cool girls wearing scarves in 2019? Ahead, master these seven scarf styling tips to keep the look fresh and modern throughout every season. Then, shop our favorites.  Lay your scarf down flat, fold it along the diagonal axis, fold two of its corners down to the middle, and fold in half.  Twist your scarf around the handle of your bag, then tie excess ends into a bow or knot for an elevated update to your favorite bag. Fold your scarf into a triangle, twist over into a thin silhouette, then wrap around your wrist, and secure with a knot.   Put your hair into a low bun or let it hang down at the nape of your neck, then fold your scarf on the diagonal to create a triangle. Tie the ends into a knot at the back of your head.     Simply wrap your silk scarf around your neck, let it drape down your chest and loosely tie leftover strands into a delicate knot at the bottom.   Fold your silk scarf into a triangle then roll up. Wrap around your neck, crossing the ends behind, and tie a gentle knot beneath the chin. Adjust the scarf to the left or right and leave long strands to hang.    
 It wouldn't be our first guess. A pair of Christian Louboutin heels would be at the top of many a woman's wish list. With their sky-high stiletto heels and that iconic red sole, Louboutins are an instantly recognizable fashion statement.  Thursdays are So Kate. üì∑ @lnestyle A post shared by  Christian Louboutin (@louboutinworld) on Aug 3, 2017 at 10:01am PDT But we never knew the story behind that iconic red sole until now. After dissecting Christian Louboutin's Rizzoli book, Marie Claire discovered that it was actually nail polish that gave the designer his inspiration.

He loved the result so much that from then on he produced all his shoes with a red lacquered sole‚Äîsomething which quickly became his signature.  Leave on a high note in Louloudancing. üì∑ @upcloseandstylish A post shared by  Christian Louboutin (@louboutinworld) on Aug 1, 2017 at 9:06am PDT Fortunately, Louboutin no longer uses red nail polish to paint his shoes but, in tribute, you can now buy a 'Rouge Louboutin' nail varnish that is exactly the same color as those iconic soles.

 Please enjoy these photos from the twin‚Äôs forgotten runway debut in 2004.  Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen may now be the CFDA Award-winning designers behind The Row, but their road to the high fashion world wasn't always so well...high fashion. In case you forgot, the sisters' first foray into fashion design was back in 2004 with the launch of the Mary-Kate and Ashley collection (sold at the fashion mecca you may know as Walmart, nonetheless). Designed for kids and the coolest of teens, the line included apparel and accessories for every fashun star in the making. Mary-Kate and Ashley's Walmart collection may be a long way from The Row's luxe leather handbags and ready-to-wear retailing for upwards of $2,000, but that doesn't make this 2004 runway debut in Paris any less iconic. Bask in all the nostalgic glory that is the Olsen's first fashion show below.  For their debut as designers, Mary-Kate and Ashley wore some signature early 2000s trends: a dress over jeans for MK, a stringy scarf for Ashley, and ultra-pointy pumps to top off both looks.  On the runway, there were going-out tops for pre-teens, ribbons worn as belts and pink handbags giving off some Paris Hilton vibes.  But because Mary-Kate and Ashley understood versatility, there were some khaki pants and knit sweaters for the more conservative‚Äìyet cool‚Äìteens.  Then, there was the beach look made of early 2000s dreams: colored lens sunglasses, crimped hair (that nearly burned off from being in the crimper so long) and a rhinestone-belted bikini.  Do you see these poses and capri pants? Don't mess with anyone wearing Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen for Walmart, thankyouverymuch.  For a more elegant playdate, there were pretty floral satin looks with matching handbags for your Lip Smackers and Nokia phone.  Okay fine, would definitely still wear this matching look today.  The All-American looks for teens didn't disappoint either.  Who needs shoes when you've got an outfit this good?  The Row is luxe and great but honestly, will anything ever compare to the genius of these iconic designs? I think not.

 Are they boots or are they jeans? An investigation.  Hello, yes, 911? I‚Äôd like to report a case of stolen identity. Jennifer Lopez‚Äôs Versace boots appear to be impersonating a pair of miniature jeans and I‚Äôm concerned. They even have their own leather belt and tiny pockets, please hurry. The singer stepped out in the denim Versace boots yesterday, making us all do a double-take: are they jeans or are they boots? This is a case for the FBI. Embracing the perplexing fashion hybrid, JLo skipped wearing pants altogether and styled the over-the-knee denim boots with an oversized white button-down shirt. Despite the fact that the boots are going through a severe identity crisis, she managed to make it a full LOOK anyway.    Versace then shared a close-up of the jean boots and revealed that in addition to a leather belt, they also have tiny pockets (which seems fully necessary).  #JenniferLopez wearing a pair of denim boots from the #VersaceResort19 collection. #VersaceCelebrities https://t.co/3RxPsl4NwR pic.twitter.com/LEnbqb7Mwy Now the real question is: what is JLo carrying around in her boot pockets?

 For Gabriela Hearst, luxury isn't a matter of "more is more," it's about making the most of what you have. As a civilization, we spent more than 8,000 years creating beautiful objects that were made in a sustainable way. Now, almost all of the plastic found in the North Pacific Ocean is from the past 15 years, according to a recent study. I've lived in New York for longer than that! Researchers estimate that only about 9 percent of mass-produced plastics ever made has been recycled. We just got used to this premade life. Try spending a day without using plastic‚Äî it's practically impossible.  We have to be very conscious that potato chip bags and candy wrappers, as innocent as they look, have nowhere to go. As I travel around the world, I see plastic everywhere. I was born on a ranch in Uruguay that is far away from everything, yet you still find plastics in the rivers there. Last year, I traveled to Turkana County, Kenya, to help with famine relief, and even in this desolate, drought-stricken area you find plastic. I come from a culture in which you‚Äôre meant to leave the earth better for your children than you found it, and I don‚Äôt feel we‚Äôre doing that. ‚ÄúIf you know that something is made with the utmost integrity, it‚Äôs more valuable, and therefore less likely to be viewed as disposable.‚Äù My dream was to create a luxury company that does all the home work for our customers on sustainability. I want to do as many products of high quality and integrity as I can. To me, that‚Äôs true luxury. It‚Äôs not trend-based; it‚Äôs timeless design that speaks to the past, present, and future. And ‚Äúpresent‚Äù is the keyword: Clothing needs to feel contemporary and relevant, which is what we try to achieve each season. To this end, we produce collections using beautiful, sustainable fabrics, and that way we don‚Äôt create waste. This makes sense from a business perspective, an environmental perspective, and a desirability perspective. IF you know that something is made with the utmost integrity, it's more valuable, and therefore less likely to be viewed as disposable.  For me, sustainability is about taking responsibility personally, professionally, and civically. At Gabriela Hearst, we have a company-wide goal of being plastic-free by next April. A lot of people don‚Äôt realize this, but nearly every piece of clothing being worn right now arrived wrapped in plastic‚Äîlike a dry-cleaning bag‚Äîbefore it landed on a shopping rack. To combat this kind of waste, we‚Äôre partnering with the innovative Israeli company TIPA, which makes 100 percent biodegradable packaging. Once a piece is unpacked, say, a dress, the packaging is composted, similar to an orange peel! I‚Äôm really big on reusing and recycling in general‚Äîmy desk at my office is a farm table from the 1800s, and the chairs are upholstered in leftover cashmere from previous collections. We are not adding to the negative, and the hope is that eventually we can add to the positive. I‚Äôm opening my first store this fall, on Madison Avenue, right by the Carlyle hotel. The goal of this store is to prove that you can create a green environment without sacrificing luxury.When people think of sustainability, many still think granola and tree-hugging. I want to educate consumers. Within the environmental movement, there‚Äôs a place for luxury, pleasure, great design, and quality.

 Alfeya Valrina's mini bags are about to take over.  We're always on the hunt for the next cool bag brand. The latest designer on our radar doesn't hail from a major fashion capital like New York or Paris. Instead, a small, female-led brand based out of Jakarta is catching our eye for all the right reasons. You may have seen Alfeya Valrina's colorful mini bags on the street style scene at Fashion Week or while scrolling Instagram. But beyond creating a buzzy new micro bag that's 'gram-worthy, the designer built something much bigger: a sustainable fashion brand that supports fair labor and local artisans in her native country, Indonesia.   Valrina studied fashion design in New York and L.A. at FIT and FIDM. But when it came time to launch her own brand, the young designer opted out of the traditional New York or Italy-based route, instead moving back to her native Indonesia to build something that could support her home country.  At a time when fashion brands around the world are struggling to get sustainability right, Valrina built her brand with zero-waste, fair labor, and ethical sourcing at its core. Instead of importing leathers from Europe, the brand only uses materials locally sourced from tanneries throughout Indonesia. Valrina employs local artisans to create jobs and promote fair wages‚Äìan especially important practice in Indonesia, where many large fashion brands exploit factory workers with extremely low pay and dangerous working conditions.     The artisans use minimal machinery, which saves on energy consumption and reduces the brand's carbon footprint. Bags are produced on-demand to avoid overstocking and excess products, and leftover pieces are up-cycled into new accessories to eliminate waste.  As for the bags themselves, the styles range from croc-embossed leather to smooth, buttery finishes in an array of colors. The mini Joe Joe bag, available in playful textures including shiny patent red, lime-green corduroy, and glam black croc, became an instant favorite amongst the fashion set. The prices range from $98 - $350, making for an affordable bag that you don't have to feel guilty about‚Äîa rarity in today's fast fashion-filled world .  After many decades of It bags coming solely from the world's biggest fashion houses, the rise of a small, one woman-led brand like Alfeya Valrina indicates more stylish women are trading in the fancy logos for purchases they can actually feel good about. 
 This is how you get through a jam-packed schedule in style. Victoria Beckham really is the very best advert for her own designs‚Äîand at the moment she is doing an excellent job of showing off her autumn/winter 2017 collection. Yesterday, the fashion designer headed to New York City to attend various meetings and talks, as well as to have a dinner date with her eldest son. For each occasion, Beckham changed into an ensemble more fabulous than the last. The day began with Beckham speaking on a panel for which she wore a high-necked, ankle-length, pink dress, which she teamed with knee-high burgundy boots. She added a pair of oversized green stud earrings and, of course, her trademark sunglasses. Next up, Beckham was spotted wearing a geometric-print ensemble. It featured a long skirt with a matching top. She wore the same burgundy boots and the same sunglasses and carried a boxy top-handled tote.   For her final ensemble of the day, Beckham headed out to dinner with her eldest son, Brooklyn, who has just relocated to the city from London to study photography at Parsons. She wore a bright orange, oversized ensemble in the form of a short-sleeved, silk, button-up shirt and matching flared trousers. Despite the late hour, her sunnies were still firmly on. The look was actually from her spring/summer 2018 collection, where it was shown in white on the catwalk. Beckham also shared a snap to her Instagram of her cuddling up to Brooklyn.

 She got it from her mama. If anyone's aware of Cindy Crawford's supermodel legacy, it's her daughter Kaia Gerber. Yesterday, the 16-year-old‚Äîwho's a rising model herself‚Äîgave her mother a very subtle sartorial shoutout, paying homage to one of her most iconic model moments. Gerber was spotted in New York City on Wednesday sporting a Pepsi bomber jacket, bringing to mind Crawford's Super Bowl commercial for the soda brand 25 years ago. The reference might not have been intentional, but it's a sweet callback nonetheless. Gerber doesn't actually have a Pepsi deal (she's currently the face of Marc Jacobs Beauty), but who knows? She could be following further into her mother's footsteps in the future. For reference, here's Crawford's original ad, circa 1992: Gerber is slated to make her NYFW debut in the days to come, but luckily she doesn't have to go through it alone; her mother is also in New York to offer her support as she achieves the major modeling milestone. "I‚Äôve given her a lot of advice," Crawford told WWD about her daughter's first NYFW. "Specifically to fashion week: There‚Äôs always another party, you don‚Äôt have to do every single thing. You can‚Äôt do every single thing."
 The designer presented his Collection 2 show in Brooklyn over the weekend.   Back in June, Alexander Wang embarked on his new runway schedule outside of the traditional New York Fashion Week calendar. The designer, who will now be presenting a Collection 1 show in June and Collection 2 show in December, debuted the latter on Saturday night with a leather and tweed-filled runway in Brooklyn.  Delivering his own take on "The American Hustle," Wang merged a melting pot of aesthetics together for a collection celebrating working women (and men) on the go. There were Matrix-inspired leather skirts fused with Chanel-esque tweeds for a fresh take on uptown meets downtown style. There were nods to '80s power suiting and a series of casual sporty looks bringing the "work hard, play hard" mentality to life on the runway. But perhaps most impressively, there were grownup pigtails and towel-wrapped hairstyles that managed to look not only cool, but somehow chic.    Wang, who has always been a master of party girl style, continued his foray into the working girl world with more matured looks for the woman who hustles well beyond her 9-to-5. While doing so, he managed to stay true to the brand's DNA‚Äîbringing a touch of downtown cool to every look, even ladylike tweed cardigans and jackets.    The collection's real pi√©ce de resistance that everyone can get at home? Bath towel-wrapped hair topping off on-the-go looks (a vibe every busy woman can get behind). Consider it the modern-day take on your mom's hair in curlers look‚Äîor perhaps bathleisure? Either way, expect to see this "hair trend" take over Instagram.    As always, the show delivered a front row filled with members of the Wang squad, including 21 Savage, Teyana Taylor, Paloma Elsesser, and a surprise appearance from Sophia the Robot.    Special guest @realsophiarobot, @21savage and @teyanataylor sitting front row at our #Collection2 runway show tonight in New York City.

 The Queen of bikini Instagrams introduces Inamorata Swim.  If there's one person who won the summer of 2017, it was Emily Ratajowski with all her endless, picture-perfect vacation Instagrams. Chances are if you are a living, breathing human with a pulse and access to Instagram, you liked at least one (or all) of the model's bathing suit snaps over the season.  Now taking her penchant for swimwear beyond the 'gram, Ratajkowski is introducing her own bathing suit collection, Inamorata Swim. The line, which is launching with six different swimsuit styles, ranges in price from $75 - $160.    Including some of the key swim elements Ratajkowski is known to rock (high-waisted cuts, cheeky backsides, and ultra-sexy cut-outs), the styles include both bikinis and one-pieces. From a leopard high-cut one-piece to a sweet polka dot bikini, Inamorata suits are ideal for getting that perfect vacation Instagram √† la Em Rata.   To celebrate the launch, the model shared a super sexy topless photoshoot wearing the brand's polka dot bikini and a towel wrapped on her head. I think I can speak for all of us when I say that I'm hoping the bathing suits come with a magical superpower to make me look like this when I wear them:  Though Ratajkowski has collaborated with brands like The Kooples on capsule collections in the past, the launch of Inamorata marks her first foray into designing a brand entirely of her own. And while it may have only launched with six styles, there's a good chance the model-backed brand will only continue to grow and take over all of our Instagram feeds (not that we're complaining).  Shop the new swimsuits now at inamorataswim.com.

 Meet the whole gang. Now this definitely isn't your grade school swim team one-piece. Cult-favorite Solid & Striped has tapped 13 top models to join their summer '18 swim team, and design their very own swimsuits. This collaboration comes as no surprise considering S&S, founded by Isaac Ross in 2012 (with women's launching in 2014), has been a go-to for the leggy set, and those that want to look like them. Are you an Elsa? A high-cut sporty bikini, or maybe you're more of a Jourdan? A sexy cut-out one-piece. The capsule collection has a little something for everyone. While we don't imagine you'll be doing laps in these chic suits, you can stock up for your next Instagram-worthy getaway starting now on solidandstriped.com. Click through to see the whole collection. Inspiration: "Sporty '90s editorials of Claudia Schiffer, Elle Macpherson, Naomi Campbell. I was also inspired by simple white cotton underwear, like understated, simple, crisp and sexy."  Inspiration: "sexy, 1970‚Äôs beach and nightlife. I wanted a suit that could transition from beach to lunch or dinner, by putting on a wrap skirt, a hoop earring and go!" How her swimsuit is reflective of her style: "I love strappy pieces ‚Äì whether it be on a shoe or a piece of clothing. It makes for an edgy and sexy look which I absolutely love! Plus, this feature also allows you to wrap and wear it however you want!" Inspiration: "I wanted it to have a vintage vibe, be wearable and comfortable. I think a high wasted brief is flattering on most figures and If I could only design one swimsuit I wanted it to be something that would appeal to more than one body type." On how she'd wear her swimsuit: "It‚Äôs great as a suit and looks super cool leaving beach with a pair of old Levi‚Äôs" Inspiration: "A modern open back simple Calvin Klein dress with the 90 degree angled straps." Inspiration: "I was inspired by the struggle to find a one piece that was both flattering and fit my body properly." Inspiration: "to create a sexy, comfortable and ageless piece, that fits every single body type!"
 Ready or not, festival season is upon us.  Whether you live for festival style or painfully cringe at the sound of those two words, Coachella season is upon us! We've all come to expect the token flower crowns, boho sundresses, and abundance of choker necklaces, but dressing for the Californian music festival doesn't have to be so predictable. Get inspired by the girls who got Coachella style right last year, and shop fresh outfit ideas for this year's festival below. It doesn't have to be all flower crowns and boho dresses.

 Take note from the ladies who wear this iconic duo with ease... Once upon a time, skinny jeans were the only acceptable denim to pair with ankle boots. With the influx of trends, in both footwear and denim, the modern pairings of now feature a variety of jean lengths, fits, and volumes that look oh-so-good when complimented by the perfect bootie. Get inspired by these new outfit combinations that will have you ready to swap out sandals for booties.  For a casual and classic ensemble, wear your favorite striped sweater with white jeans and a pair of suede booties; the variety in this look is easy to recreate for the weekend.  The buttery cocoa brown of this little suede boot looks so good against a stark white jean.¬† Take your outfit to the Old Town Road with an updated western inspired look. Keep things modern by pairing high-waisted straight-leg jeans with a pair of patent leather stiletto boots.  These patent boots are a wardrobe essential that'll last stick around for seasons to come.¬† A cropped, raw-hem pair of denim is the perfect way to show off a shorter statement bootie, especially one featuring croc-effect.   This easy-to-wear croc-effect boot from Ganni deserves to be shown off.¬† Wearing classic pieces with a trendy print is the perfect way to upgrade an everyday look.  Elevate even the most casual of errand-running outfits with a snakeskin boot like this one.¬† Leave it to Alyssa Coscarelli to make a case for the two-tone bootie. Opt for a cropped wide-leg pair of jeans so these unique boots can do all the talking.  A black leather two-tone boot featuring a pointed toe and cow-girl inspired details.¬† White on white on white is always a good idea; take it from Rihanna in styling white boots with white wide-leg pants. If she does it, then it's definitely a cool-girl move.  A kitten heel that was made for walking.¬† A longline plaid coat looks extra chic when worn with neutral, matching booties.  For a trendy twist on your favorite neutral shoe.¬† You can't go wrong with the classics, right? A belted coat, vintage Levi's, and a camel-hued kitten heel boot goes a long way.  These are easy to walk in, and easy to style; no matter the aesthetic. Despite our love and obsession for cropped high waisted denim, flare leg jeans are still just as chic. Play with proportions and lengths by pairing them with sleek patent leather kitten booties.  For an affordable and subtly elegant kitten heeled boot option.¬† Comfortable outfits aren't exclusive to leggings and flip flops anymore. Put a twist on your casual wear with an oversized chunky sweater, creamy colored jeans and a pair of lace-up booties that'll surely turn heads everywhere you go.  These budget-friendly booties feature a stacked wooden heel and corset lacing, making them look more expensive than they are.¬†
 The Swedish model on killing it on the 'gram and what makes the perfect pair of jeans. If you're one of Elsa Hosk's 5.4 million Instagram followers, you know that she's not just another model who posts all of her editorials and covers‚Äîthis is a girl who loves fashion, and wears it. Her images are fun and cool and a little off-the-cuff, the kind of French hotel room shots and NYC street style images that get reposted by lesser-followed "influencers". She wears vintage Dior, Gucci and Fendi, along with current Saint Laurent suits and inexpensive brands like Reformation. Hosk has also dipped a toe in designing and collaborations. The latest on the docket is an 11-piece sustainable collection with model-favorite denim label J.Brand‚Äîand it's good.  The new line, called the #LittleJean collection‚Äîfollowing a successful #LittleBlueJean and #LittleBlackJean collaboration with former Kardashian assistant and social media darling Stephanie Shepherd‚Äîis comprised of a leather blazer and five pant styles, including a '70s-inspired high rise, a classic vintage pair, and an '80s cut with added hardware.  As for the sustainability element, the brand went for it. There was an average 90% water reduction used during the wash process, manmade eco stones were used, eliminating the need to incorporate mined pumice stones, a natural resource from the Earth that results in large amounts of post-use waste‚Äîwhich is ultimately discarded in our oceans‚Äîand all tags, trims, and hardware are made of recycled and/or sustainably sourced materials. Hosk oversaw the design and creative of the collection (which ranges in price from $248 to $1298) including the lookbook, photographed by Zooey Grossman. Read about Hosk's inspiration, her influencer status, and how her hometown Stockholm style melds with her NYC life. What do you look for in great denim? For me a great jean is about the whole package‚Äîit‚Äôs got to have the fit, the wash, the cool-factor and flatter my body. In this collection it was so important for me to do a few different styles for every woman to feel great and comfortable and look amazing. Denim is so personal! Not everyone looks good in one jean, so I really tried to make something for every woman regarding both fit and style.  What‚Äôs your ideal denim silhouette? I think I‚Äôll be living in loose denim for a while. I‚Äôm in love with the wide '70s style (the Monday Jean) and the round '80s style in this collection (the Playday Jean). Oh and the straight gray jean (the Sunday Jean) has been my go-to ever since I got the sample.  How would you describe your style? Mix and match, vintage and designer together, comfortable, unique!   What was your vision for this collection? To make a bad-ass collection for every woman!  I wanted every jean to be cool but wouldn‚Äôt go out of style, have modern shapes and vintage looking washes, and be comfortable while flattering!  Shop additional pieces at jbrandjeans.com. What is your favorite piece? It's so hard to choose but I love the leather pieces and the round '80s style (the Playday Jean) and the straight gray jean (the Sunday Jean) that I live in every day.  How would you style it? I‚Äôve been styling the jean with little crop tops , sweatshirts, sneakers or strapped heels.  Has living in the US influenced your style? If so how? In the US the style is very laid-back and casual, a bit more influenced by sport than Europe.  How does it compare to Stockholm style? I haven‚Äôt been there a lot in the past years so I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs changed but people really love fashion and wear a lot more tailored and structured  pieces. I used to have so many nice structured coats that just feel too dressy on the streets of New York. I think the weather also influenced Scandinavian style a lot so people wear a lot of gray, black, and white.  You‚Äôve become a fashion influencer on social media, how do you feel about that role? I‚Äôm ok with that because I love fashion! I love finding vintage pieces and mixing it with my designer wardrobe. I‚Äôll wear a 20 dollar vintage dress with a Vuitton chunky sneaker. That‚Äôs my favorite way of dressing, something a bit off but it still goes together somehow. I wear a lot of color because it makes me happy.  What‚Äôs your approach to Instagram? How often do you post? Do you plan content? I never plan anything so all my posts are pretty organic. I try to snap a cool photo on my way to an event or when I‚Äôm out to lunch with my boyfriend, or after work, I never let it take more than five minutes. I don‚Äôt look for good locations, just if I happen to walk by something and it doesn‚Äôt seem like it would take up too much of my time. I don‚Äôt really have time to plan my Instagram 'cause I‚Äôm always working so it has to be on the go, which I think makes it look a bit more real too, because it is! How would you describe what‚Äôs in your closet right now? What‚Äôs the mix? Just too much stuff! But a lot of oversized blazers and little simple strappy sandals, vintage Chanel and new Prada!  In your years of modeling what did you learn about posing for a photo effectively? To know your angles and face expressions.  Do you treat how you pose for Insta differently than a modeling job? Yes definitely! For Instagram I just try to make it in the moment kind of more real life moments and more natural poses, and for fashion it can be that or very extreme.  Do you see more designing in your future? Definitely more to come I hope! I have so much fun designing and coming up with concepts. 
 Welcome to Sustainable Style, a new series in partnership with the New Standard Institute, where we'll be publishing stories devoted to the fashion and beauty industry's effects on the environment. Click through for lessons on how to shop sustainably, explorations on what the future of your closet really looks like, and plenty of myth-busting along the way.  Shapeless silhouettes. Hippie fabrics. Crunchy designs. These words have long been synonymous with sustainable fashion, but a new guard of eco-conscious clothing pioneers are proving that earth-friendly and fashion-forward are no longer mutually exclusive.  Focusing on artisanal labor, high-quality natural fabrics and local supply chains, along with a reduction of energy and water consumption, elimination of chemical use, and minimal impact on forests and biodiversity, we've put together eight sustainable looks from brands that have our seal of approval. One thing you won't see? Recycled polyester, which has become synonymous with sustainability, despite data suggesting it may have a higher carbon footprint than natural fiber‚Äînot to mention the micro-plastic pollution it generates.  As we steer the industry on a more sustainable path, we hope to impart one important message to our readers: Only buy what you love, and what you will wear for decades to come.  This, we've come to learn, is the best solution‚Äîoutside of wearing no clothes at all. Did you know fashion made from polyester is responsible for 500,000 tonnes of plastic microfibers entering our oceans every year?   Did you know garment workers usually receive only .5 - 4 percent of the final retail cost of a garment?   Did you know the fast fashion industry is responsible for over 8 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions? 
  Did you know by 2030, CO2 emissions from the fashion industry are projected to increase by more than 60 percent? Did you know Americans are throwing away 81 lbs of clothing per person, per year? Did you know plastic microfibers shed from synthetic clothing are ending up in our food supply? If the industry continues on its current path, by 2050 it could use more than 26 percent of the total global carbon budget.

 The actress is taking notes from her royal BFF. Even while they're thousands of miles apart it seems that best friends Meghan Markle and Priyanka Chopra still influence each others personal style.  Today in New York City, Chopra stepped out of her hotel in a sleek, shiny red leather pencil skirt, and coordinating silk blouse by Akris. She punctuated the look with the perfect red lip, and a tiny Stalvey box bag to her business casual look.  Did the Quantico actress take a page from Markle's royal style book? Just last week the Duchess was seen wearing an almost identical monochromatic ensemble while visiting the University of Chichester's Engineering and Digital Technology Park in the UK. The Duchess got a little edgy with her regal wear for the occasion, in a green leather pencil skirt, matching blouse and nude pumps.  Markle and Chopra have only been friends about three years but they clearly have a true bond in the style department, or could their stylists be comparing notes? Markle works with Canada-based stylist Jessica Mulroney (who she also counts as a friend), and Chopra works with celebrity stylist Mimi Cuttrell who also styles Gigi Hadid, Bella Hadid and Arianna Grande. The actress is also adding tech investor to her already accomplished resume. The New York Times announced just last week that she is the latest investor in the dating app Bumble, as well as, Holberton, a computer training school. Chopra also shared the news on her Instagram to her 28.4 million followers saying, "I am honored to join two companies that strive to expand gender diversity in the tech space, and make a social impact for the greater good... let's do this!!"   A new chapter for me! I am so excited to partner with @bumble and @holbertonschool as an investor.

 "What I once felt ashamed of, I now celebrate." Lately I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about space.  What does it mean to navigate a world that does not create space for you? One that shuns you and constantly reaffirms your otherness‚Äîhow do you find your place? For me, it took creating an identity for myself outside of my appearance, my family history, and my socioeconomic background. It took removing the labels I was forced to wear (‚Äúpoor‚Äù and ‚Äúfemale‚Äù) and the expectations that came with them (that I was inadequate, inferior, and could not perform at the same level as my male or affluent peers). It took speaking candidly about subjects that we, as a society, have stigmatized or deemed taboo. It took wearing my hair in an afro regardless of the venue. It took uninhibited self expression and raw vulnerability, even at the risk of being disliked or misunderstood. There have been times, particularly in situations where I am being considered for a job, when I‚Äôve contemplated shrinking my afro rather than wearing it in its stretched-out state so that it wouldn‚Äôt take up so much space or make people uncomfortable. But making myself small for the comfort of others would be a disservice to me and to those who feel forced to shrink their truth in any capacity‚Äîespecially Black women.  "There have been times when I‚Äôve contemplated shrinking my afro so that it wouldn‚Äôt take up so much space or make people uncomfortable." From our curves to our lips to our hair, our body parts have been commodified and sold by the very same people who shamed us into not loving ourselves. Unlearning the belief that my natural features were unattractive, and allowing my hair to grow and exist in its natural state, was a significant part of my healing process.  Much like my hair, I have grown and transformed internally in ways that I did not know were possible. I learned to love myself, and that self love has manifested not only as acceptance, but as gratitude for my physical appearance, where I come from and what I have been through. What I once hated and felt ashamed of, I now celebrate. I took the anger, pain and frustration I had buried deep inside of me and turned it into treasure. That‚Äôs how evolution works: we experience periods of intense pain, sadness and anxiety and transform it into something beautiful, just like caterpillars becoming butterflies. I realized that my darkness‚Äîthe things I was taught to feel ashamed of and to hide‚Äîis actually my light, and by exposing that to the world I could free myself and give permission to others to do the same. Right now we are experiencing metamorphosis on a social level. We are in the midst of darkness but soon our species will emerge with a new sense of awareness: one that does not give priority and privilege to an elite few based on race, gender, or affluence, but one that has equal space, for everyone.  I have made it my mission in life to both occupy spaces that already exist‚Äîspaces that people like me have been intentionally excluded from‚Äîand to create entirely new spaces: spaces within our education system that address the specific needs of students in each district, instead of applying a one-size-fits-all algorithm; spaces within entertainment and fashion that give a platform to artists who have been systematically excluded; spaces within our homes that allow for authentic self expression regardless of what we have come to consider "normal". "Unlearning the belief that my natural features were unattractive was a significant part of my healing process." I want each of us to fearlessly create our own pathways through life rather than following the ones that have been marked for us. I want to normalize being abnormal. It is time to usher in a new paradigm centered around compassion, empathy and living authentically from the heart. For me this starts with healing the Black community through art that accurately reflects our multidimensional nature‚Äîrather than the one dimensional characterizations we‚Äôve been forcefed, and that have dominated our collective narrative. Recently, I shot a documentary about my family‚Äôs fight for freedom after having been brought to America as enslaved people. The film, which will be released in 2019, highlights the intergenerational movement toward liberation and how it is the job of each new generation to become a little more free than the last. I also finished writing a book, which will also be published in 2019, chronicling the process of my evolution and the lessons I learned during my healing journey. I believe art made for those, and about those, who have been neglected, misrepresented and unrepresented can help heal the world, and I want to use all mediums (television, books, film, theatre, dance, and photography) to assist in that process. As a model, creating powerful imagery has also become an important tool for raising consciousness. The intention behind this series of photos was to play with the concept of dimension and space. The hair was purposefully stretched out as far as possible to create contrast with the light-colored background so that it could be seen and celebrated in its natural glory.  It is my hope that we, as individuals, come to recognize the power each of us holds to help reshape the world. By living authentically and sharing our perspectives, we are able to create space for ourselves and for those who are constantly made to feel invisible.

 DVF has held the position for 13 years.  It's the beginning of a new era at the Council of Fashion Designers of America. Today, the organization named Tom Ford as its new Chairman. He is succeeding Diane von Furstenberg, who has held the role for 13 years.  After holding a vote today, the CFDA revealed the designer's appointment will be effective on January 1, 2020.

 Kanye West's Yeezy Calabasas pants are dropping soon. Adidas is releasing Kanye West's Yeezy Calabasas track pants‚Äîthe athleisure bottoms favored by Kim Kardashian. The rapper's wife and design muse has been flaunting the striped sweatpants everywhere from Snapchat to the streets since early this year.  West already debuted an earlier installment of the pants online at yeezysupply.com in March, but this iteration‚Äîwhich comes in black and maroon‚Äîwill be available on a larger scale, thanks to his partnership with Adidas. (But there's no promising it won't sell out as fast as the rest of West's covetable designs.) The track pant, $120, hits retail stores on October 8 in the U.S. and November 22 worldwide. Cop yourself a pair on adidas.com/yeezy and select stores. LOCATIONS
 The model confirmed the news on Instagram. Update, 9/14: Slick Woods has confirmed that she did indeed give birth to a baby boy right after walking Rihanna's Savage x Fenty show during New York Fashion Week. The model took to Instagram to share the announcement and reveal that she was actually in labor while walking the lingerie runway show.  According to the caption, Woods spent 14 hours in labor before welcoming a baby boy. "This is the face of a WOMAN IN LABOR, we hold shit down most of us don‚Äôt even know how much we‚Äôre going through, I‚Äôm here to say I CAN DO WHATEVER THE FUCK I WANT WHENEVER THE FUCK I WANT AND SO CAN YOU," she wrote.  Though Woods has yet to confirm the baby's name, the model previously revealed she planned to go with the name Saphir in an interview with Elle UK.  Congratulations to Slick on an epic runway walk and a new baby boy!  Original Article, 9/13: Model Slick Woods reportedly went into labor after walking in Rihanna's Savage x Fenty lingerie fashion show in Brooklyn last night. TMZ first broke the news and E! News confirmed. TMZ reported, "We're told paramedics showed up to help Slick along. She was taken to the nearest hospital." It's still unconfirmed if she gave birth. Woods has not yet publicly addressed the baby news. However, Rihanna's cosmetics brand Fenty Beauty congratulated the model on Instagram this evening. BAZAAR.com has reached out to Woods for comment.  The 22-year-old first revealed she was pregnant in July, with a baby bump photo on Instagram. "In good company," she captioned the photo of her hugging her belly in a swimsuit. Woods previously told Elle UK that she's due to September (which means she walked the runway while nine months pregnant). She also revealed to the magazine that her baby is a boy, and she wants to name him Saphir, inspired by the September birthstone.  Saphir's father is Adonis Bosso, who is also a model. Woods gushed over him to Elle UK, "‚ÄòI hear sob stories about baby daddy drama. Being 21 and my baby‚Äôs father being excited is just step one. There are girls who don‚Äôt even have that." Woods' appearance was one of the highlights of Rihanna's empowering Savage x Fenty presentation last night. She worked black pasties and a strappy, barely-there leotard that showed off her baby bump. She strutted in sheer thigh-high tights and heels‚Äîwhile nine months pregnant!‚Äîand totally stole the show.  She also wasn't the only pregnant model to walk the show; another mom-to-be made an appearance on the runway too. Twitter was abuzz over the bump-baring stars at the presentation. Congrats, Slick!

 Couture and bridal‚Äîballgown not required. It's not uncommon for Haute Couture designers to end their runway spectaculars with a bride.  Giambattista Valli sent down a parade of ivory confections yesterday, while Ralph & Russo ended their show with Elsa Hosk as their bride of the season; and, while not explicitly bridal, even Maria Grazia Chiuri graced her runways with a handful of ivory pieces worthy of an aisle.  At Chanel, an ornately-decked bride is the expected finale to each otherworldly collection, set in the scene that inspires Lagerfeld and his design team for the season. For Haute Couture Spring 2019, guests entered the Grand Palais from the snow-covered streets of Paris, and were seated poolside in the garden of an Italian villa. The show began with Chanel's statement suiting, followed by cocktail dresses in shades of pastels. A black-and-white section gave way to eveningwear in the candy-colored hues of the collection, punctuated with exceptional embroideries and plays on volume.  While a bride in soft color, or with an exaggerated skirt seemed the clear finish, Chanel is never about the expected. A bride clad in an embellished one-piece swimsuit and a bridal swimcap with a trailing cathedral-length veil finished the show, giving beach bridal a whole new look.  While we at BAZAAR feel the modern beach bride is anything but basic, Chanel's fully-encrusted swimwear paired with an over-the-top veil proves that bridal doesn't always include a ballgown‚Äìor even a dress for that matter.  Coco Chanel famously said, "Before you leave the house, look in the mirror and take one thing off,‚Äù and ‚ÄúIt is always better to be underdressed.‚Äù Chanel's Couture bride of the season is case in point.
 Dogs and supermodels and Barry Manilow, oh my!  Another New York Fashion Week has come and gone and while this season was relatively quiet, there were still a few standout moments to highlight. Many brands are trying to navigate the changing landscape of traditional runway shows, but in the midst of the unknown, there were several new runway debuts worth noting, along with a few gimmicks that we unabashedly enjoyed anyway (hello Barry Manilow singing "Copacabana" on the runway). From the inspiring to the unexpectedly fun, these were the best moments from the New York Fashion Week Fall 2019 runways.   Now this is how you close a fashion show! @11honore set the bar high for the kickoff of #NYFW. @lavernecox in @zacposen A post shared by  Harper's BAZAAR (@harpersbazaarus) on Feb 6, 2019 at 3:59pm PST The week kicked off with an inclusive runway debut from 11 Honor√©, the luxury e-commerce site offering designer fashion in sizes 10 and up. A diverse cast of models, including Precious Lee and Candice Huffine, hit the catwalk in a range of designer looks that will be available to shop in extended sizes on the site. The cherry on top of an already incredible show? The brand tapped Laverne Cox for the runway finale and she delivered the most dramatic, instantly iconic walk in a Zac Posen gown.  Nobody knew what to expect from the debut of Japanese costume designer Tomo Koizumi, but what resulted was one of those unexpectedly magical moments that takes the whole room's breath away. After being discovered by Katie Grand on Instagram last month, the designer was immediately invited to present a collection at Marc Jacobs' Madison Avenue store. A star-studded cast of models including Rowan Blanchard, Gwendoline Christie, Bella Hadid, Emily Ratajkowski, Joan Smalls, and more cascaded from a  staircase in a series of colorful and whimsical puff gowns. Fashion loves a fairytale story and Koizumi's‚Äîboth colorful and unexpected‚Äîwas just that.  It was a season of model legends making comebacks on the runway. Patti Hansen, who served as the inspiration behind Michael Kors' '70s collection, closed the show in a metallic suit, marking her first runway appearance since the '90s. Seventies supermodel legend Pat Cleveland led the finale walk at Hellessy in a red hooded gown and sequin pants. And Christie Brinkley closed Elie Tahari's 40th anniversary show after high-fiving with her daughter, Sailor Brinkley Cook, on the runway.  Two years since taking the creative reins at Oscar de la Renta, Laura Kim and Fernando Garcia delivered their best collection for the fashion house yet. There was strong suiting followed by a series of stunning, red carpet-worthy gowns ranging from feathers to a full ball gown worn by Bella Hadid in the finale. It was an elegant mix of daywear and eveningwear that felt fresh, but still worthy of the late De la Renta‚Äôs approval. Despite the eternal buzz around legacy fashion houses, a growing list of emerging designers proved they're the ones to watch during NYFW. Instagram-favorite Batsheva made its debut with a performance art presentation, while newbie Khaite staged a stunning first runway collection atop a pile of leaves. Though not their first shows, rising brands Marina Moscone and Area were worth noting too. Moscone presented her collection against a backdrop of books at The Strand, while Area once again delivered a series of ultra fun accessories and ready-to-wear.  From left: Khaite, Marina Moscone, Area, and Batsheva Giving us the most precious moment of the week, Lela Rose hosted a dog show and a fashion show all in one. The designer presented her Fall 2019 collection with the "Roseminster Dog Show," which cast both canines and models on the runway. The main takeaway: cocktail dresses and suits look infinitely better when worn next to a lineup of English sheep dogs, poodles, and golden retrievers.  It wouldn't be NYFW without a surprise runway performance and this season we got not one, but two. The first came in the form of Lil' Kim closing out The Blonds runway. The rapper performed her classic "The Jump Off" while dancing down the runway in a sparkling gold bodysuit.  Neutrals and bright colors had the ultimate showdown in this season's collections. Predominantly beige and butter hues shaped collections at The Row, Gabriela Hearst, and Boss, proving you can never go wrong with a classic color palette. But more designers than ever filled the runways with color, color, and more color. Bright pinks, purples, oranges, and blues took over at brands like Carolina Herrera, Sies Marjan, and Rosie Assoulin. But which palette will be the winner come Fall 2019?  From top left: The Row, Boss, Gabriela Hearst; Carolina Herrera, Rosie Assoulin, Sies Marjan   We can always count on @michaelkors for a fashion show with a great soundtrack. This season he upped the ante with a performance by @barrymanilowofficial, (and got everyone up out of their seats) to celebrate the disco- inspired collection. A post shared by  Harper's BAZAAR (@harpersbazaarus) on Feb 13, 2019 at 8:07am PST In one of the most unexpected runway surprises of all time, Michael Kors' '70s-inspired disco show ended with an impromptu performance of "Copacabana" by none other than Barry Manilow. The legend hit the runway in a bedazzled orange jacket as he performed his classic dance hit alongside Bella Hadid and Fran Summers. It was ridiculously fun and will undoubtedly be stuck in our heads for the rest of the week.  As per usual, Marc Jacobs delivered a theatrical grand finale to the week. This season, the designer tapped Christy Turlington Burns to close his show. The iconic supermodel's appearance marked her grand return to the runway for the first time in over two decades‚Äîwith her last walk taking place back in the '90s. It was an epic, and stunning, return and according to Christy's Instagram, perhaps her last show ever. 
 These uniquely different women show you how.   The power of fashion is strong, and the clothes you wear have the ability to influence all aspects of your day. At their very best, they make you feel like you. And while each season comes with its own handful of major trends, they won‚Äôt do much for your wardrobe if they lack your own unique spin. Fortunately, you don‚Äôt need to hire a personal stylist to learn how to incorporate each piece into your closet. Inspiration can come from everywhere: an influencer‚Äôs Instagram, the runway, and resources like The Edit, a curated site created by Macy's Fashion Office that offers expert fashion styling tips, trend guides, and home and beauty advice. For even more inspo, we asked five very different women with their own unique sense of personal style to share how they‚Äôd wear a few of this fall‚Äôs most exciting trends: the menswear blazer, florals, metallic boots, and red handbags. Not to mention how each outfit makes them feel. The Floral Midi Dress As a BAZAAR editor, Lauren Fisher spends her days scouring the internet, streets, and social media to uncover the latest trends, stylish It-girls, and fashion news.  The conclusion: There‚Äôs a lot out there, so looking to a trusted source like The Edit for tips is imperative.  That‚Äôs where she discovered this muted floral dress. An all-over subdued print pairs seamlessly with any neutral color‚Äîlike this dark green‚Äîand allows a red handbag to grab the most attention. 
  The Multitasking Floral Jacket-Dress Katie Sturino is an entrepreneur. The woman behind #supersizethelook is an advocate for plus-sized fashion, and has her own beauty brand called MegaBabe. As a woman who grabs life and gets the most out of it as possible, it makes sense she wants her clothes to work for her‚Äîthey need to be comfortable, functional, and occasion appropriate. This floral blazer works as both a coat over jeans and a T-shirt, or buttoned up as a dress with heels. As Katie says, ‚ÄúMenswear-inspired pieces can work on any body type.‚Äù 
  The Statement Making Blazer After spending years as a fashion editor at Atelier Dor√©, Tori Lazar has acquired a wealth of knowledge about what the most stylish women of New York like to wear (and how they pull it off). She‚Äôs also developed her own sense of personal style along the way, and has discovered that the most important component of any look isn‚Äôt what you wear‚Äîit‚Äôs the attitude you wear it with. For Lazar, it's important to step outside your comfort zone. ‚ÄúPairing bold colors in similar hues, like this burgundy and blush pink, is a fun way to interpret a menswear blazer,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a little Gucci-inspired!‚Äù 
  The Bold Botanical Minidress Aubree Ashtyn isn‚Äôt afraid to show off her style. As a ballet and hip-hop dancer, she loves to express herself and isn‚Äôt afraid to push her boundaries. She's accomplished a lot in her career, including launching her own successful YouTube channel, as well as learning a Beyonc√© dance routine in 24 hours‚Äîwith no instruction. Whether it‚Äôs through dance or what she's wearing, personal expression is her A-game, which is why she chooses outfits that show off her personality. An example: this bright floral minidress that's such a show-off piece, it needs little to no adornment. #nailedit. 
  The Mismatched Plaid Skirt Suit Jessica Wu knows a thing or two about style. As an e-commerce director and Instagram star, she‚Äôs always sporting the latest trends. Her take on a menswear blazer involves pairing it with a similar but slightly mismatched plaid skirt and metallic ankle booties (another key trend for the season). ‚ÄúBalance an oversized blazer with a slim mini skirt,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúAnd always push up the sleeves.‚Äù
 From '80s florals and bucket hats to the little white dress and the little white top. Nothing says summer quite like barely there sandals, the ideal little white dress, Bardot-ready tops, floral dresses, and of course, bucket hats. See what to buy now to look so perfectly summer 2019. Fashion blogger Leonie Hanne incorporates plenty of trends in one single look‚Äîwide leg trousers, hair barrettes and a square neck knit top. The latter is a '90s throwback that's flattering,  architectural, and works perfectly with everything from pencil skirts to mom jeans. Your goes-with-everything summer top. Barrettes, scrunchies, and bows are just that little pick-me-up you need for your summer looks. Feel free to have fun with your hair accessories‚Äîlife is too short not to put a bow on it.  This genius hybrid is both a bow and a scrunchie‚Äîperfect for that easy Parisian moment you've been waiting for.¬† There's a lot of goodness happening here‚Äîa belted swimsuit, a robe as cover-up‚Äîbut we're falling hard for that bucket hat. It's somehow both current and retro, and does an excellent job at protecting you from the sun. A colorful frock made out of poplin‚Äîas seen on Hannah Bronfman‚Äîgives you the structured, summery feeling you didn't even know you'd been needing. Wear it with white slides during the¬†day and swap for block heels at night. A great linen trouser that you can belt is a dream summer pant‚Äîlight-weight, but still smart. We love the idea of pairing it with a sexy top, like this one from Posse or a simple white blouse for daytime. Wear these with a silk button-down to the office and over a simple maillot on the weekends. A little puff sleeve dress is just what your Insta feed ordered this summer. This dress is just straight-up cute and will definitely help you stand out against the¬†after-dark crowd at the beach. This modern iteration on the Laura Ashley style would look just as pretty and feminine with strappy low-heeled sandals as it would with knee-high boots. Heels are getting lower and shoes are getting more subtle‚Äîbut with interesting flourishes by the likes of Jacquemus, Staud and The Row. These shoes can pair with anything from shorts to slip dresses, and denim to minis. These barely there babies are ultra-flattering and pretty enough to put on display. Be easy breezy‚Äîbut also power-hungry‚Äîin a bold summer suit. Swap your work pumps for sexy barely-there sandals to take this look from work into the weekend. Tibi jacket, $949, and coordinating pants, $569, matchesfashion.com. SHOP NOW There's something inherently European riviera about a white blouse with that extra something special‚Äîlike Birkin or Bardot might show up in the same top at any moment. Nothing says summer quite like a pretty white blouse paired with vintage jeans or a maxi skirt after dark. A good animal print is a year-round staple, but find your wild side for summer in a sleek slip dress. Wear alone when the weather calls for it, and layer a light knit underneath come fall. Beach bags have hit the city streets, too‚Äîpick just the right bag to take you from concrete to sand.  SHOP NOW There's nothing quite as romantic as a whisper thin floral dress on a balmy summer night. This pretty piece is fit for weekends at the beach and a summer wedding. Nina Agdal proves all you really need in the tropics is a great little white dress, a hat for shade‚Äîand someone to snap the pic. Does it get more summer-ready than a fresh-to-death white dress?¬† We adore the shape of this mini with cut out details.

 Comme Si founder Jenni Lee on picking the right mentor, investors, and more. Where you see socks, Jenni Lee sees opportunity. The Comme Si founder is betting that women want more from the accessory than just something to slip into their shoes every day. Her first collection, rendered in Italian silk and Egyptian cotton, proves that she‚Äôs on to something. On the cusp of her second season, she‚Äôs looking to the next steps for the business, as well as who she wants to work with along the way. Speaking with fellow Wing member Natalia Oberti Noguera, founder and CEO of Pipeline Angels, Lee was able to get another supportive perspective on the areas of the business she feels are too critical to compromise on, from using top-quality materials to hiring an inclusive team of women and people of color. Here‚Äôs what she learned about why good partners can make all the difference. ‚ÄúNow that the brand is out there and I have real customers who are reacting to my product and my brand, it feels like the foundation of Comme Si is established. I personally can see the huge opportunity in where it can go and how big it can grow. It feels like this stage of a business is the right time to look for investment, when you know who your customer is and how you want to grow, and you just need the capital to move forward and do that at the pace that you want. ‚ÄúIt was reassuring to hear Natalia confirm that if there are values and certain things that are really important to me, I should not sacrifice them, and I should look for partners who also care about or want to get on board with those same things.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe talked a lot about what she calls ‚Äòsmart money:‚Äô You shouldn‚Äôt be looking for just the money. You should be looking for money, plus, what‚Äôs the network that this person has? What skills and expertise and background do they bring to the table? What are the values that they care about? Which was really great to hear, because it's something I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about‚Äîthat if I were to take on investment, that is what I‚Äôd be looking for. ‚ÄúI forget who told me this, but apparently the average relationship between a founder and an investor usually spans 10 to 12 years, which is longer than the average marriage in the U.S. It‚Äôs interesting to think of it in that way‚Äîthey are someone that you will work with for a really long time, and so it makes sense that you should make sure your values align. You should make sure you want the same or similar things.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI will say, it‚Äôs very important to find a really good accountant and a lawyer. It‚Äôs been mostly friends, or people that I know who have started businesses, who I‚Äôve asked, Who do you work with? Who would you recommend? Who would you definitely not recommend?‚Äô ‚ÄúThat whole idea about social capital is so important. And it‚Äôs so true: If there are people who have gone through it before that you really trust, I find that those recommendations go so much further than if you‚Äôre navigating it on your own. ‚ÄúNatalia was really kind, too, saying, ‚ÄòIf you‚Äôre looking for anything from accounting help to legal help, I know great women who are in senior positions who want to support female entrepreneurs that I'm happy to recommend you to.‚Äô I think continuing that network effect of women continuing to support women, it‚Äôs so important.‚Äù Worn throughout: Veronica Beard blazer, The Line by K bodysuit, Vince shorts, Poppy Finch earrings, Musier shoes

 Gaga's eccentric style is back‚Äîand so is her iconic hair bow.  You may have used Memorial Day Weekend to catch up on some rest, attend a barbecue or two, etc etc, but Lady Gaga used the four-day weekend to make an astounding 12 (I repeat: TWELVE!!) outfit changes while hitting the recording studio in New York. From ultra-ladylike dresses to head-to-toe leopard to the resurgence of her iconic 2008 hair bow, the singer pulled out all the stops with her looks this weekend.  Bringing a mix of the Fame Monster era with her Tony Bennett jazz collab years, Gaga brought back the eclectic and dramatic style we all know and love her for this weekend. Here's a look back at all 12 of her outfit changes that will have you saying "yaaaaas Gaga, you look so gooood." Going for an ultra-ladylike, ballerina-inspired look, Gaga stepped out in a white tulle dress, black cat-eye sunglasses, and black Neil J. Rodgers slingback pumps on Thursday.  Later in the day, she emerged in a Cher Horowitz-meets-Working-Girl-inspired outfit. Once again, she topped off the look with cat-eye-sunglasses, a clutch, and Neil J. Rodgers pumps.  Oh, this old thing? That night, Gaga went full-on showgirl in this red tulle Christian Siriano look, black satin opera gloves, diamond jewelry, and retro cat-eye sunglasses for a totally casual dinner out in New York. Iconic.  On Friday, the singer hit the studio once again in a polished little black dress, oversized sunnies, a Delvaux bag, and pumps for a look that practically screamed "I'm about to sue you for every penny you have." Keeping with the polished, ladylike style, Gaga went for a Jackie Kennedy-esque look in a mock-turtleneck dress, Delvaux bag, and beehive-inspired hairstyle later in the day.  Adding an unexpected splash of fun to her classic white blouse and black mini skirt, the singer opted for a pair of sparkling Rochas glitter boots that lended a playful go-go girl vibe to her look.  ...and then later emerged in a high-neck houndstooth dress and platform heels.  On Sunday, Gaga ditched her polished look for an over-the-top leopard ensemble, a Mark Cross bag, and ultra-skinny cat-eye sunglasses. Oh, and do you see what I see? A tiny braided hair bow sitting atop her head‚Äîreviving her iconic 2008 hair bow in a fresh way.  ...but then she went back to the elegant look with a Peter Pan collared dress, a Mark Cross bag, and pointed pumps later that day.  Continuing to serve up boss lady looks, Gaga then stepped out in a double-breasted Mola Walker pantsuit, Erickson Beamon hoop earrings and a crossbody logo bag the next day.  Once again rocking her hair bow, Gaga tapped into her Fame Monster days by wearing a blue leather dress, matching gloves, and sky-high patent heel platform boots.  And that same night, she then changed to a second leather ensemble‚Äîthis time a sleek black leather coat √† la The Matrix.  Yaaaaaaas Gaga, you look so gooood.  Bow down to the queen of outfit changes. 
 Jackets, required... Not all blazers are created equal. Oversized menswear blazers are having a moment, but a sleek '90s leather single-breasted jacket also feels right on time. Are you stocked with something colorful? Perhaps a longer black jacket that does the job of le smoking? Get your blazer game tight with 7 jacket that will instantly update your wardrobe‚Äîand shop them, of course. A good cream or white jacket is just the thing to make all your looks really come alive. Double points if you belt it like Sophie Turner. A total classic, this will live in your closet for years to come. We love the contrasting buttons and double-breasted shape happening on this jacket. A gray, menswear inspired suit jacket with a subtle plaid pattern will take you miles. The look right now is a bit oversized, so you can wear it as a suit like Hailey Bieber, over vintage Levi's, or on top of a slip dress.  We love the muted yet¬†colorful plaid pattern in this single-breasted version. Bella Hadid makes the case for a slim, '90s inspired leather jacket. While she wears hers with an all-leather look by Altuzrra, we think it would be equally chic with cream trousers or a silk maxi skirt. Store your moto in favor of this fresh silhouette. Gabrielle Union proves how perfect a great fitting black jacket can be‚Äîwe love it with nothing underneath for evening. Tr√©s Yves Saint Laurent. This longer one is exceedingly elegant. We adore that this one can also be worn as a dress with sheer tights and pumps. It's all about a bit of a rumpled tan jacket for day for Emrata. The model wore this same jacket with a cropped top and coordinating trousers earlier in the week, proving its inherent versatility.   Say it with me: linen blend. Get all the cool vibes linen provides with less wrinkling on a great shaped jacket. Pick a shade, any shade. A blazer in a color is a one-stop shop to statement-making perfection. Yoyo Cao proves the point. Try it double-breasted. I know we said any color, but light blue feels right on time right now. Whether you opt for a sculptural Balenciaga jacket, a double breasted belted number like Christine Centenera, or a cropped piece, this is the blazer that you put on when you're ready to stand out. Just wait for the compliments to roll in. This hot take on a bolero jacket feels like a totally fresh iteration on the classic blazer.
 The luxury conglomerates created a charter to improve working conditions for models.  Two of fashion's largest conglomerates are teaming up to improve working conditions for models in the industry. As New York Fashion Week officially kicks off, Kering and LVMH announced the formation of a charter which seeks to protect models' health, well-being, and rights while working.  The charter states that female models must be a French size 34 (U.S. size 2) or above and male models must be a French size 44 or above. Size 32 women (U.S. size 0) will be banned from working with all Kering and LVMH brands in any capacity. Along with weight guidelines, the charter also forbids the hiring of models under the age of 16 for shows or shoots. Models between the ages of 16 - 18 years old are not permitted to work between 10 PM - 6 AM and must be accompanied by a parent or guardian.  Moving forward, both Kering and LVMH have agreed to only work with models who can present a medical certificate and additionally, will provide a psychologist/therapist on call for models during working hours.  As for the fashion houses implementing these changes, Kering owns Gucci, Saint Laurent, Balenciaga, Stella McCartney and many more while LVMH owns Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior Couture, C√©line, Marc Jacobs and more. Considering both the industry influence and the number of brands the luxury conglomerates own, the charter will undoubtedly pave the way for much of the fashion industry.  The long-overdue guidelines, which will go into effect immediately, follow France's ban of excessively thin models and James Scully's disturbing abuse allegations at model castings last season. 
 She hasn‚Äôt gone out in five months, and has forged a friendship with Huma Abedin. Though she didn't dress up like the Pope, like Rihanna did, Scarlett Johansson still caused some controversy with her Met Gala gown on Monday night. That's because she decided to wear a dress from Marchesa, and one-half of that designer duo, Georgina Chapman, is the ex-wife of Harvey Weinstein.  It was the first time a major star had worn Marchesa on the red carpet since Weinstein became the center of a sexual misconduct scandal. And Chapman herself had remained silent‚Äîuntil now. To recap: Since October, more than 50 women have come forward with allegations against Weinstein; the allegations include sexual assault, harassment, and unwanted advancement over the past three decades. In a response to a New Yorker article on the matter, Weinstein‚Äôs spokesperson noted, ‚Äúany allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein.‚Äù Shortly after the allegations became public, Chapman announced she was leaving Weinstein, and back in January they agreed on a divorce settlement, according to People. In a new interview with Vogue, Chapman reveals what her life has been like since the scandal, from getting therapy to striking up a friendship with Huma Abedin, whose ex-husband is disgraced politician Anthony Weiner. Here are some of the biggest takeaways from Chapman‚Äôs first return to public life. When asked whether she was ever suspicious of Weinstein, Chapman responded, ‚ÄúAbsolutely not. Never.‚Äù She said that their marriage was a happy one, with Weinstein giving her confidence and being a great father to their children (India, 7, and Dashiell, 5). ‚ÄúThere was a part of me that was terribly naive‚Äîclearly, so naive. I have moments of rage, I have moments of confusion, I have moments of disbelief!‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. I wish I had the answers. But I don‚Äôt.‚Äù Chapman told Vogue that she hasn't felt right going out in public since the scandal hit. ‚ÄúI was so humiliated and so broken...that...I, I, I...didn‚Äôt think it was respectful to go out,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI thought, Who am I to be parading around with all of this going on? It‚Äôs still so very, very raw. I was walking up the stairs the other day and I stopped; it was like all the air had been punched out of my lungs.‚Äù Chapman said she‚Äôs been seeing a therapist, and it‚Äôs clear from the interview she still has a lot to emotionally process, especially as a mother to their two children. ‚ÄúI have moments when I just cry for my children. What are their lives going to be?‚Äù she said, through tears. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like, they love their dad. They love him. I just can‚Äôt bear it for them!‚Äù It‚Äôs easy to presume that after the Weinstein scandal hit the news, celebrities would steer clear from wearing clothing made by his wife. In the past, Chapman‚Äôs friend Neil Gaiman admitted, Weinstein would sometimes push actresses to wear Marchesa on the red carpet.  But Chapman insisted that the decision to scale things back post-scandal was hers. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt feel it was appropriate given the situation. All the women who have been hurt deserve dignity and respect, so I want to give it the time it deserves. It‚Äôs a time for mourning, really,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúA lot of people reached out and said, ‚ÄòLet me wear something.‚Äô‚Äù And post-Met gala, perhaps they'll get to.  A few months before Weinstein‚Äôs scandal broke, Chapman met Huma Abedin, the now-ex wife of Anthony Weiner. Abedin, who rarely gives interviews, spoke to Vogue about how the two grew closer, bonding over their husbands‚Äô scandals. ‚ÄúWe just...bonded. In allll kinds of ways,‚Äù Abedin said. ‚ÄúThis particular club, ironically, it‚Äôs not such a small one: women who have had to endure it in such a public way, women like Georgina and me. People don‚Äôt feel sorry for us; you don‚Äôt get that empathy.‚Äù

 Yes Cardi!!! Cardi B is making her Paris Fashion Week debut with a bang. The rapper arrived in the French capital looking like a walking runway in a showstopping Michael Costello look.  Giving us vintage French couture vibes mixed with a little bit of '80s Dynasty, Cardi wore a colorful high-neck print dress with a high-slit and exaggerated shoulder pads. The pi√®ce de r√©sistance of the Michael Costello-designed look was her matching wide-brim hat.   I‚Äôm Mrs OMG that bitch is shameless .

She also shared some excellent commentary on the look via Instagram. A sampling: "Man, these Italians got me f*cked up, giving me champagne in the afternoon, they must not know that I'm light. What's good, b*tch? We out here in Milan, drinking sparkling water, eating some spaghettis (insert evil laughter)....b*tch!!!"

 After Calvin Klein, Marc Jacobs and Burberry, a mother-daughter spa day What's the perfect way to celebrate your fashion month catwalk debut? If you're Kaia Gerber, a spa day (or at least a spa moment) with supermodel mum Cindy Crawford. The pair took a quick pampering break from fashion month, according to an Instagram post shared by make-up artist Hung Vanngo .  Current mood üòõ#spaday A post shared by  Hung Vanngo (@hungvanngo) on Sep 19, 2017 at 12:06pm PDT   The 16-year-old made her official debut at NYFW's kick-off Calvin Klein before walking in Alexander Wang, Fenty Puma and closing the Marc Jacobs show.  Both mother and daughter opted for under-eye masks and Crawford took it a step further by getting a brow tint treatment. This, of course, isn't the supermodel's first rodeo, so she obviously knows how to recover like a pro.

 For those who wouldn't be caught dead wearing Party City.  If you've ever celebrated New Year's Eve, chances are you've worn one of those classic feathered "Happy New Year!" headbands once or twice in your lifetime.  For those who crave the finer things in life and won't settle for Party City's version of the headpiece, Alexander Wang is here to save the day with a high fashion rendition of the look. Made for girls who party like it's NYE all year round, the range of headbands features phrases like "Wangover," "After After Party," and of course, "Party Animal." A little steeper than a Party City price point, Wang's "After After Party" headband will cost you a cool $6,000. Yes, just to reiterate: six thousand dollars.  Good news for those looking for a bargain: the brand is also offering a "Wangover" version of the headband for $5,100 and a "Party Animal" headband that's practically a steal at $3,900.  Wang's party-ready headbands first appeared back in September at the designer's Spring 2018 show on Bella Hadid and Kendall Jenner. Right after the looks walked the runway, Wang hosted one of his most over-the-top #WangFest after parties ever‚Äîcomplete with donut towers, pools of Budweiser, and performances by Cardi B, Ja Rule, Ashanti, and A$AP Ferg. In other words, Wang has the art of partying down pat‚Äîjust in case you needed some background on the luxury headbands.  While most of us will probably just settle for the $5 drugstore version of the look, you can bet that the #WangSquad will be out in full force wearing these $6,000 accessories.

 Tracking all the standout looks from this season's top collections.  There's a luxury that comes from Italy that can't be matched‚Äîa tailoring from the likes of Prada, Jil Sander, Gucci, and more, that makes high fashion feel both the work of artisans and designers. See what Milano has to offer for Spring 2020 with the five best looks from each major collection.   What's old is new again‚Äîbut Donatella Versace proved with her Spring 2020 collection that she has no plans of veering away from fashion's forefront, while still staking claim on the brand's accomplishments of the past. The show began by hearkening back to basics: killer coats, sexy suiting, and sultry (as expected) takes on officewear and outerwear, all strutting through a scene where prints where projected on the walls, hinting at what was to come. Then came the jungle prints, printed via a Google-provided technology on beaded cocktail looks, coats, pants, and more, with fluorescent options of the same ilk breaking them up in between. The jungle print was hard not to recognize. We so rarely think about the world before Instagram, and Versace's show asked us to take ourselves back, to the late '90s, when red carpets were paramount to street style and social media. One gown, above all, changed that game (and red carpet coverage) as we know it‚ÄîJennifer Lopez's jungle-printed Versace gown for the 2000 Grammy Awards. The gown was part of the inspiration behind Google Images, given the world's voracious desire to see it up-close, and Donatella's play with projections and smart printing acknowledged the brand's inspiration on modern technology with an ode to the past.  And then came the showstopper: The new, even more revealing (if you can imagine), version of the iconic jungle-print gown made its appearance‚Äîon J.Lo‚Äîas the show's finale, finally giving the gown the Instagram moment it deserved. ‚ÄîCarrie Goldberg When one thinks about Italian fashion and what it represents, craftsmanship above all else comes to mind, followed by heritage, leather, and sex appeal. Tod's offers the top three in droves, and is expected to deliver quality basics made in top-notch fabrics one knows will last a lifetime and end up in the closet of future generations.  That pressure to deliver heirloom-quality products sometimes leaves drama and ostentatiousness to other labels, and this season didn't go out of its way to break the mold. Standouts included the opening bomber and palazzo shorts ensemble paired with the brand's signature loafers (pictured here), a waist bag shown on an almost-'80s chocolate short suit, and a zebra trench coat, which seemed to be the show's biggest departure from the classics‚Äîbut would easily complement a wardrobe of them. ‚ÄîCarrie Goldberg
 A casual gift for the man in your life.  Picking out the perfect gift for the man in your life can be a daunting task. Luckily, Balmain's debut pre-fall menswear collection is here and it's filled with all the glitz and sparkle that's undoubtedly missing from your man's wardrobe.  The standout item of the collection, however, is a crystal-encrusted baseball jacket, which retails for a casual $40,000. The jacket (pictured above) took two whole months to create and features the words "Balmain Army" across the back, of course. ‚ÄúWhen it was completed, it was like Christmas, it was like, ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs done, it‚Äôs exactly what I wanted,'" Balmain's creative director Olivier Rousteing told WWD.  This marks the first time Balmain has produced a pre-fall collection for its menswear line. Citing a "revolution" in men's fashion, Rousteing told WWD the fashion house will be taking more risks with its men's collection, embracing "glamour without feeling ridiculous." And what better way to do that than with a $40,000 crystalized baseball jacket?

 Step one: try to get the owner of a luxury fashion house to adopt you.  "I‚Äôve wanted to work in fashion ever since I saw The Devil Wears Prada, but how do I get my foot in the door if I have no connections?" ‚ÄîHire Me, Miranda  First of all, that's the thing that made you want to work in fashion? Did we see the same movie? I mean the Chanel boots were good but phew, I think you may have missed some of the plot lines and mental breakdowns in there. But okay, one girl's toxic work environment is another's treasure, I suppose. Let's continue... Breaking into the fashion industry can seem daunting, especially since it's still a world where nepotism largely rules (unfortunately). But it's still possible to succeed even if your parents don't own a major fashion house or small country (I'm proof of this).   The trick is to make your own connections. Make a list of the people and companies you admire within the industry. Do diligent research, make sure your resume is up to date, and start reaching out to a few key people for informational interviews (not to ask for jobs, just to learn more about their career!). Reach out via email or LinkedIn (or a social media platform if appropriate), tell them you admire their work, and politely ask for 15 minutes of their time over a quick coffee to discuss their own career path and how they got to where they are. Most people are happy to help (any excuse to talk about themselves is always good). You never know what you'll learn or what opportunities these quick coffees can lead to, the fashion industry is a very small place! It takes a lot of time, patience, and applying to many, many jobs, but don't be afraid to put yourself out there. In the meantime, read the below books by fashion veterans who've done it themselves.  "What‚Äôs the best way to explain gaps in a resume or multiple short term jobs?" ‚ÄîMichael That entirely depends. Were you off volunteering to save the world, taking time to raise your children, or exploring other career trajectories? Or were you laying on your parent's couch suffocating underneath a pile of Doritos packets while scrolling Instagram? If the answer is the latter, LIE!! But in most cases, it's best to just be honest in your cover letter and interviews. Without drawing too much attention to any gaps in your previous experience, tell the truth if asked instead of concocting some wild, intricate story. Before any interviews, be prepared with how you're going to explain any gaps or short-term jobs so you don't appear flustered when asked. Be confident in what your journey (short-term jobs or not) has taught you‚Äîand how it has prepared you for whatever job you're applying for. It's best to be well-versed in the job description, as well, so you can tailor your previous work experiences or resume gaps as learning opportunities for the job ahead. "I'm stuck in a career rut. How do you find your *true* purpose and what type of job you‚Äôre meant to do?" ‚ÄîNess  I really wish there was some magical formula I could give you that would reveal the answer, but sadly I think the process and journey is different for everyone. Some people know their purpose the minute they start talking; others probably never really take the time to discover it (sorry, this isn't a motivational TedTalk, I'm just telling you the facts).  The most important thing for you to do is connect with yourself: What makes you feel fulfilled and happy? Don't think about the job that's going to make you the most money, clout, or seem most impressive at your high school reunion. What actually brings you joy and fulfillment? It might be helping people, or it might be basking in solitude while avoiding the entire human race. But either way, the next step is to find a job that supports this purpose and joy in some capacity. This is something that will likely take some time (and trial and error) to find the real answer to.  How do you actually connect with yourself in the Year of Our Lord 2019? It's not with sheet masks or CBD bath salts, but with actually taking real time for yourself. Keep a journal, write daily to-do lists and weekly goals to stay focused. No matter what your current job is, don't let it fully consume your entire life. If your job title is the only thing that defines you, you're probably not going to feel like you have a real, balanced purpose in life. Get some hobbies, connections, and joy outside of your workplace, too. Go towards whatever makes you feel happiest and inspired, the rest will eventually fall into place in a way that aligns with all areas of your life. While trying to find your own purpose, I highly recommend reading the You Are a Badass book series (it's not as corny as it sounds, I swear) to better learn the art of connecting with yourself.

 This season, designers cast a spell with gothic silhouettes, mystical prints, and otherworldly textures. On February 24, 2017, thousands of witches across the country gathered to cast a binding spell on Donald Trump. Singer Lana Del Rey took part in the mass hex, and encouraged her fans on social media to participate too. The gatherings have since become a monthly ritual, taking place at the stroke of midnight on a night of the waning crescent moon. Time was when witches were burned at the stake‚Äîor, at the very least, relegated to the margins of society. But in recent years, witchiness‚Äîas a personal style, a philosophy, and, yes, even a form of self-care‚Äîhas not only gone mainstream, it‚Äôs taken on a patina of cool. Stores like Urban Outfitters are lousy with crystals and candles. On Instagram, influencers like Emma Roberts are as likely to show off an aura reading as they are a new outfit. And in the beauty world, many of the hottest skin-care ingredients (snail mucus, bee venom) sound like they‚Äôve been formulated in a steaming cauldron instead a lab.   Witchcraft has also spread its wings into the bright halls of fashion, with Gucci leading the way. After Alessandro Michele‚Äôs much-discussed fall collection, which included a procession of dragon bearers and cephalophores‚Äîsaints who are depicted carrying their own severed heads‚Äîthe artistic director ushered in Resort 2019 with a collection that can best be described as a goth teen‚Äôs wildest dream. The show took place in a Roman necropolis in southern France, accompanied by smoke and candles and a dramatic 17th century musical composition sung in Latin. Fashion‚Äôs elite surrounded by the dead‚Äîand, by extension, reminders of their own mortality. And the clothes were anything but breezy holiday fun. There were crucifixes, lace, brooches, tall boots, capes, veils, crushed velvet, spikes, high collars, long sleeves. Other brands showed similar inclinations: Picture Louis Vuitton‚Äôs bone-white Victorian gown, Vera Wang‚Äôs jet-black tulle, and Max Mara‚Äôs ethereal capes. "Modern witchiness reveals itself through fashion in clothes that articulate joy and express a healthy relationship with mortality while also being difficult for the male gaze." Modern witchiness reveals itself through fashion in clothes that articulate joy and express a healthy relationship with mortality while also being difficult for the male gaze. It‚Äôs not about dressing to please an amorphous other but yourself: Grey Gardens meets Wednesday Addams meets Stevie Nicks meets nuns. Luxe meets feeling yourself meets fuck off.    Today‚Äôs witches couldn‚Äôt care less about outward approval: Their focus lies in their own pleasure and craft as they carefully construct their identities, one aesthetic and/or metaphysical choice at a time. The titular witch in Mikhail Bulgakov‚Äôs The Master and Margarita becomes that way by rubbing a cream from a demon all over her body and then taking off, flying, into the night. The rest of us? We‚Äôve donned our capes, we‚Äôre right behind her. This article originally appears in the November 2018 issue of Harper's BAZAAR.

 Send help. Last season, we reported The Great Jeans Apocalypse was among us when new designer Thibaut debuted no pants-pants (aka thong jeans) at Tokyo Fashion Week. Understandably, the internet quickly lost its cool over the extremely ripped and deconstructed jeans.  For those who thought the jeans (or lack thereof) were just a runway gimmick, think again: LA-based brand Carmar Denim created their own thong jeans knockoff‚Äîand they're already sold-out. Yes, I repeat: a pair of $168 denim seams now has a wait-list of people who want to buy them.  If you're wondering who exactly is buying all these thong jeans and where exactly they're wearing them, you're not alone. But fear not, Carmar has already taken to Instagram to prove the barely-there jeans can be worn totally casually in a multitude of social situations... Here we have the kid-friendly thong jeans in action at an amusement park...

 She gave the new baby a truly unique name.  Coco Rocha welcomed her second child, a baby boy named Iver Eames Conran, earlier today. The new mom took to Instagram to announce the news and share a sweet photo of her new baby.  According to her caption, the baby weighed in at 7lbs and 10oz. And just like the model's first child, baby Iver Eames already has his own Instagram handle at just 1-day-old. In fact, the newborn posted his first Instagram from inside the womb... The account, which is managed by Coco Rocha and her husband James Conran, then shared another sweet photo from the hospital room. In the photo, Coco and her oldest child, daughter Ioni, pose alongside the new baby boy.  Iver is following in the footsteps of Coco's first-born, Ioni James Conran, who already has over 70,000 Instagram followers at just 2 years old.  Along with the toddler's impressive social media following, she also made her runway debut alongside her supermodel mom at Paris Couture Week in January. Ioni and Coco had a high-fashion mommy-and-me moment on Jean Paul Gaultier's Spring 2018 Couture runway, closing the show in matching icy blue gowns, black opera gloves, and ornate headpieces. The duo also served up some seriously fierce poses.  Get ready for Iver Eames to have just as much fashion influence as little Ioni. Congratulations to the happy family!
 Balmain‚Äôs creative director‚Äîwhose collaboration with Victoria‚Äôs Secret just debuted in Shanghai‚Äîcan‚Äôt wait to get home for Christmas.  8:30 A.M. On Christmas morning I‚Äôll wake up in Bordeaux in my childhood bedroom surrounded by my posters. As a kid, I was obsessed with the Backstreet Boys, Britney Spears, Claudia Schiffer, and Cindy Crawford. I don‚Äôt want to say what I‚Äôll be wearing because it looks a bit strange, but, okay‚ÄîPetit Bateau striped pajamas with a matching cap, which my mom still buys for me. My dad and I will have breakfast next door with my grandma and granddad. We‚Äôll eat ome- lets with bacon and nice homemade bread. 10:30 A.M. I‚Äôll go back home to shower and then put on skinny pants, a tank top, and my double-breasted jacket. No matter where I am, it‚Äôs my uniform. When I travel I take 10 pairs of pants and 10 jackets with me, but in my house in Paris I have, like, 50. 11:30 A.M. Bordeaux is a really French city in the Napoleonic style, and there‚Äôs a big garden next to my high school where I used to go for lunch. I‚Äôll walk there with my dad and sit and talk forever about my life, my fears, and his personal life as well. 1:30 P.M. After that I‚Äôll go to my mom‚Äôs house. We love watching Fantaghir√≤, a children‚Äôs fantasy series from when I was growing up. It starred Alessandra Martines, who was the wife of director Claude Lelouch. 3:30 P.M. My mom and I usually go antiques shopping and pick out something for her house or mine. I‚Äôm into 18th-century paintings with Baroque frames. I also love desks that look like they are from some castle. My mom collects glasses, carafes, dishes, and lace napkins. 5:00 P.M. It‚Äôs really cold in the winter in Bordeaux, so we‚Äôll sit in a tea place and have little biscuits. 8:00 P.M. I‚Äôll have a special dinner with all of my dad‚Äôs family. We‚Äôll have seafood as a starter, followed by roasted chicken with potatoes and some mustard. If my grandma bakes a cake with strawberries, I‚Äôm the happiest person in the world. 10:00 P.M. At the end of the night we‚Äôll sit by the fireplace and eat so many Ferrero Rocher chocolates. When I‚Äôm back in Bordeaux, I feel like I‚Äôm far away from everything. But I do keep up with Instagram, and I love posting nice moments with my family. Social media for me is like underwear‚ÄîI can‚Äôt go without it! My granddad is really bad at selfie-taking, but my two little cousins are pretty good. 11:30 P.M. I need my rest because I usually go to Dubai for New Year‚Äôs. I‚Äôll throw a party on the beach, and all of my friends from L.A. and New York will join together at this moment to enjoy being under the sun. A lot of girls come, and sometimes they‚Äôre just like, ‚ÄúBabe, I‚Äôm here.‚Äù One year, Kendall, Gigi, and Selena came. We‚Äôll watch the fireworks, and I‚Äôll close my eyes and make wishes. I can tell you that all the wishes I‚Äôve made until now have come true. I hope for much happiness for us all in 2018.  From left: "My mom and I usually go antiques shopping."; MERRY XMAS WITH MY 2 Angels #clara #anna #familytime #cousinsforever; "If my grandma bakes a cake with strawberries, I‚Äôm the happiest person in the world."; "When I‚Äôm back in Bordeaux, I feel like I‚Äôm far away from everything."; Seasonal sparkle, Balmain by Victoria‚Äôs Secret bra, $248, victoriassecret.com.
 One of the first memories I have related to fashion was being a kid and buying a pair of shoes that were entirely covered in rainbow glitter. They were as fantastic as you might imagine. I remember my mother turning to the saleslady and saying, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt we all wish we could have a pair of those?‚Äù And thinking to myself, ‚Äúwait, why can‚Äôt you?‚Äù That was before Kate Spade.    Kate Spade changed so much when she started her line in 1993. That was a time when cool adult fashion consisted of overalls and plaid shirts. And into that grungy world, Kate Spade entered with preppy bags in a variety of wildly bright colors.    "Kate Spade seemed to understand that women who liked wearing pink dresses weren‚Äôt stupid or frivolous." The line spoke to women who still wanted to be girly, who never saw anything wrong with being girly. Not everyone wanted to emulate the actors from The Craft (though, to be fair, the women on the Craft poster looked great). And, inspired by vintage handbags, Kate Spade allowed them to embrace that feminine spirit. Time Magazine wrote about how she ‚Äúpersuaded women in the '90s to trade what she calls 'the nothing black bag' for a purse with personality.‚Äù    I suspect not all that much persuasion was necessary. Women were just waiting for an affordable option that allowed them to have a little fun with fashion. And, God, her pieces had personality. Inspired by her mother‚Äôs old purses that came in a variety, ‚Äúoranges, pinks, chocolates, huge pearl buttons,‚Äù Kate Spade‚Äôs purses were never nothing black bags. Go to the company‚Äôs website today and you‚Äôll see that her first collection inspired a range of bags that look like pineapples, purses covered in comic print, totes that declare they‚Äôre ‚Äúout and about‚Äù and clutches emblazoned with flamingos. In 2003, The New York Times wrote that, ‚ÄúIf Dorothy Parker were a product, she would be a Kate Spade clutch.‚Äù That may account for the dizzying number of Kate Spade products with Dorothy Parker quotes emblazoned upon them. Like Dorothy Parker, Kate Spade‚Äôs pieces started conversations. And it wasn‚Äôt just the handbags. The whole line seemed able to find the fun in femininity without ever making fun of femininity. Kate Spade seemed to understand that women who liked wearing pink dresses weren‚Äôt stupid or frivolous because of that style choice‚Äîafter all, she proudly donned pink tights and founded a multimillion dollar empire. It was an affordably priced wardrobe made for the Elle Woods of the world.    And if you‚Äôre looking for a pair of sparkle shoes, your first stop should be Kate Spade. They‚Äôve made countless glittery pairs of shoes since they started doing footwear in 1999. My mother and I both have pairs of her shoes now.    Today, Mindy Kaling tweeted that Spade‚Äôs clothes ‚Äúwere colorful, bold, cheerful, and encouraged women to find the twinkly person inside them. You couldn‚Äôt walk into her boutiques and not smile.‚Äù   I am heartbroken about the news of Kate Spade. I have worn her clothes many, many times. They were colorful, bold, cheerful, and encouraged women to find the twinkly person inside them. You couldn‚Äôt walk into her boutiques and not smile. Rest In Peace, Kate. Kate Spade taught us that we can still enjoy color and sparkle, and that fashion can be as playful as it was when we were children. We can still be twinkly in adulthood. It was fashion that focused on making people happy.   Which is one of the reasons why it‚Äôs so tragic that Kate Spade's life ended with such sadness. It seems shocking, always, when someone who has brought so much joy into the lives of so many takes their own life, as Kate Spade did. The fact that many of us will miss her creative gifts certainly has nothing on the pain that her family must be feeling. But will miss those gifts, all the same. She was inspiring to many of us.    The world will be a less sparkling place for the loss of her. But the twinkly person she inspired in many of us will hopefully go on, in shoes that she created for us.

 The late First Lady gets the Moschino treatment.  From human bouquets to McDonald's merchandise to actual garbage and beyond, Moschino's Jeremy Scott knows how to commit to a theme when it comes to his runway shows.  Following last season's maximal garden-inspired collection, the Italian fashion house looked to a different source of inspiration for its Fall 2018 show today: the women of the 1960s. Namely, Jackie Kennedy.  In a season full of '80s-inspired collections, Moschino instead went full-on '60s with a colorful runway that reimagined Jackie Kennedy's signature look for 2018. Featuring oranges, purples, and yellows, the bright lineup of 62 looks recreated the late First Lady's iconic tweed skirt suit and pillbox hat.  The skirt suits, hats, and tights weren't the only colorful things to hit the runway though. A few of the models sported head-to-toe body paint in bright colors of neon yellow, blue, and lime green‚Äîmaking for an alien-like take on Jackie O's classic style.  The parade of @moschino alien Jackie Kennedys #MFW pic.twitter.com/mXoVbpx4Yx Kaia Gerber, Joan Smalls, Bella Hadid, and Gigi Hadid were amongst those who walked the show, each sporting a different rendition of Jackie Kennedy's look. Kaia hit the runway in a bright orange skirt suit, pillbox hat, and matching pumps.  Bella wore a bright purple iteration of the look with a colorful patterned pillbox hat.  The eldest Hadid, meanwhile, wore an orange coat featuring patent leather trim and a matching hat.  Channeling a different side of the '60s woman, Joan Smalls wore a little black dress, leather gloves, and black sunglasses.  The final 15 looks of the show departed from the skirt suit look and instead, entered into evening wear territory. Featuring dazzling crystal-embellishments, silky draping, and striking colors, the pieces were a modern-day take on '60s evening attire‚Äîall while keeping the elegant bouffant hairstyle in check.  Though tame in comparison to Scott's previous runways, Moschino's take on Jackie Kennedy and the Swinging Sixties felt equal parts quirky and cool during a season of many subdued collection themes. And who doesn't love an unexpected ode to a style icon?
 Silvia, Delfina and Leonetta Fendi reflect on a decade of the Peekaboo... The Fendi Peekaboo first hit the runway a decade ago in September 2008 for the Spring 2009 season. This was prime It bag era‚Äîwhen, in fashion speak, what you carried mattered more than any shoe, dress or coat ever could. Fast forward to now, and while many It bags have fallen out of favor and gone the way of other trend-driven items on eBay and The Real Real, the Peekaboo has made its way into the realm of collector's item.  And collectors have their pick. The Peekaboo now comes in multiple iterations: the Large Peekaboo, Regular Peekaboo, Mini Peekaboo and Micro Peekaboo.   There is also the higher-end  Peekaboo Essential and the newer Peekaboo Essentially (a smaller sized Essential). There are more than one thousand materials and nearly unlimited color combinations of the Peekaboo. To date, the most expensive Peekaboo is the Fendi Gems Mini Peekaboo in white croco, white gold, diamonds, rubies and amethysts. Swoon. To celebrate 10 years of the chicest game of hide and seek this side of Milan, Fendi is releasing the #MeAndMyPeekaboo campaign with a video featuring the designer of the iconic bag and Creative Director for accessories, menswear and kidswear for Fendi, Silvia Venturini Fendi and daughters Leonetta Luciano Fendi and Delfina Delettrez Fendi. The way the ladies speak of the bag is almost of something mythic and well-loved‚Äîlike a mysterious, but favored family member. ‚ÄúThe Peekaboo is my baby. It‚Äôs a creature that belongs to me," says Silvia Venturini Fendi; "The Peekaboo bag is precious, mysterious and timeless," Delfina Delettrez Fendi comments; and "The Peekaboo bag is timeless, versatile and full of surprises," chimes in Leonetta Luciano Fendi. Watch the video in full below.

 Finally. On Tuesday, just two days before New York Fashion Week officially begins, the Council of Fashion Designers of America, in partnership with the Model Alliance, has announced that for the first time ever, models will have a private area to change at the shows. If you go backstage during NYFW, you might find any number of people ‚Äî members of the press, show runners, PR reps, photographers and more ‚Äî milling about as models strip down and change into their show outfits. In the many years that NYFW has been going on, models simply have had to get dressed in front of everyone as if it were no big deal. "Models have raised concerns about invasive photography and lack of privacy while changing clothes backstage at New York Fashion Week," Model Alliance founder Sara Ziff said in a statement. "The Model Alliance takes these concerns seriously, and we decided to take additional steps this season to ensure a safe and respectful work environment by providing private changing areas backstage." The CFDA and the Model Alliance have worked with IMG and Pier59 Studios, which hosts many of the runway events during NYFW, to build these spaces. Right now, it's unclear what the areas will look like and whether or not they'll be limited just to the shows at Pier59 ‚Äî or if they'll be a fixture at every official show, although all participants have been encouraged to comply. What is clear: These concerns, and other issues surrounding sexual harassment and safety, are now the focus of the fashion industry in America. In an open letter dated February 1, CFDA chairwoman Diane von Furstenberg wrote, "The current climate has been marked by brave women and men and their revelations about an unacceptable culture in politics, sports, and entertainment, as well as in fashion." The statement outlines the three main focuses‚Äîhealth, safety, and diversity‚Äîof an evolved initiative to ensure the standards in the fashion industry in America are up to date: In addition, the CFDA has provided a clear outline for what sexual harassment means to them, per the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission:  A step in the right direction.

 Bow down... And that's a wrap on another season of collections‚Äîbut really, it's just the beginning. Here, our 10 top looks from a season that favored bold shoulders, vacation-wear, pastels and a return to pretty.   Karl Lagerfeld took showgoers to la plage for Spring 2019, complete with sand, blue skies and a tide. There were straw hats and suiting, little dresses and lace pants‚Äîbut it's this seemingly simple black and white number on Kaia Gerber that stole our hearts.  Nicolas Ghesqui√®re has always been at home in the future. His space age set sat in direct opposition to the ornate Louvre , whose grounds it stood upon. Futurism was a hallmark of the 1980s, a decade the designer borrowed from, while simultaneously embracing modern fabrications. But it's this Memphis Milano wallpaper print on a "Blade Runner" shaped suit that is haunting our dreams.  Looking through Dries van Noten's Spring runway gives us that excited Christmas day feeling that only the rare collection we really, really want to wear can give us. It conjures those terms that aren't so much about fashion as they are about joy‚Äîlike wow these pieces are so "pretty" and "cool." Forgive us for our lack of eloquence, but something about a floral print, a bandeau top, a sheer overlay and a blue and white plaid skirt with matching shoes leaves us at a loss for words and a vast appreciation for one of the Antwerp 6.  Kerby Jean-Raymond made the New York set decamp to Brooklyn‚Äîand Weeksville in particular. Not the sort of spot Alexander Wang throws parties or Eckhaus Lata shows off its cool factor, but instead a place rich in history, as home to one of the country's first free black communities post abolition.  The Spring runways were rife with nods to seaside life, but this net dress with fringe and feather detail with a sheer pink overlay coat was our favorite.  Just when boho was starting to feel like a forgotten word, Natacha Ramsay-Levi is bringing back the vibe, thanks to a collection inspired by, well, Morocco and Ibiza of course. This scarf print, fringed pants and vest, low slung belt and beaded earrings look is the boho babe grown up, a little tailored, but still laid back af.  Jonathan Anderson can do no wrong as far as we're concerned. His collections feel like the well-curated rooms of art collectors and architects. They're smart, never overwrought, and just the right amount of playful. Yes, there's a blazer, but it's pink, and it has a matching sweater vest and there's shirting and cool boots, but it's all finished with a bold crocheted raffia, oversized bag. It's Anderson's world right now and we're happy to live in it.  Pierpaolo Piccioli has cornered the market on beautiful and beautifully made dresses and gowns. Spring 2019 elicited a standing ovation from a crowd of people who had seen somewhere between 20 and 50 runway presentations in the preceding weeks. Consider it proof of pretty then that his billowing cotton dresses, kaleidoscope prints and sequin suiting literally got people to their feet. This pin-tucked pink number with oversized sleeves and a jaunt chapeau has our number.   There are the clothes you want to step into the moment they leave the runway and the clothes that create the fantasy we all want to live in. Marc Jacobs is a bit dreamer, a bit Mad Hatter. His dive back into the 1980s last season helped create a veritable wave of returns to the Greed Decade. This season, we're here for this prom dress and oversized blue jacket with matching hair.  We'll take a walk in Rodarte's garden anytime we're invited. With glorious, diaphanous gowns, lace skirting, and a shimmering, bold gold dress, all topped off with flower crowns that would make Frida Kahlo proud, Spring was a magical showing of ultra-femininity by Laura and Kate Mulleavy. This white suit with puff sleeves is seemingly simple, but just the sort of special and timeless look we've come to expect from the sister design duo. Welcome back to New York  Julien Dossena has taken the fashion world by storm since beginning his tenure at Paco Rabanne. What started as a study of Rabanne's well-known futuristic designs has evolved into a clever mix of those famed chain links, mixed with prints from far off lands, lingerie details and a decidedly-90s silhouette. Even with that lean silhouette throw-back these looks feel incredibly new. Put us on the pre-order list for these fantastic pants and maybe 5 other looks on our wish list.
  Witness her killer moves with your own eyes.  Last night, Rihanna cemented her status as a fashion mogul when she presented her latest Savage X Fenty lingerie collection with a stunning runway spectacle. The show, which was filmed on September 10 in Brooklyn, featured supermodels from Alek Wek to the Hadid sisters, diverse women of various shapes and sizes, dancers, and musical performers. The standout star in the roster (aside from Rihanna herself)? Normani, without a doubt.  The breakout pop and R&B singer, formerly of the girl group Fifth Harmony, modeled a printed bra, underwear, matching gloves, and black tights for the show, but rather than doing a typical runway strut, she delivered a fierce dance performance (to Sean Paul's "Get Busy") that left viewers in complete awe.  good morning to normani destroying ‚Äòget busy‚Äô üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî• pic.twitter.com/zPXicG3fEI NORMANI ladies and gentlemen üíãüñ§ @Normani #SAVAGEXFENTYSHOW pic.twitter.com/iIhGQ9p5vR Omg @Normani you look so amazing #SAVAGEXFENTYSHOW pic.twitter.com/1kUc0rArAq Normani is everything.

Rihanna did not let the young artist's talents go unnoticed.  "I wanted to highlight women who are powerful," the designer told ELLE.com of her Savage X Fenty show, which was choreographed by Parris Goebel. "To me, power in whatever way you master it is very sexy. And with someone like Normani, you know, she's an incredible dancer, and dance is athleticism. Dance is powerful. It would be a shame to miss out on the opportunity to have that kind of beauty and power in the show."  Rihanna claimed that she is "not nearly as good a dancer as Normani," but she does try to test-run her lingerie pieces by dancing in them in her kitchen. 
  Down Under designers are having a moment. Every so often we see a shift around designers of a certain region really make an impact in our style stateside. Whether its the Scandinavian's "norm core" or the Colombian designers color and print-enhanced movement‚Äîand let's not forget the great Danes. Now, it's Australia and New Zealand's turn. Not only are they redefining the modern woman's wardrobe but many are also making great strides, and leading the way in sustainability. From Maggie Marilyn, to Hansen and Gretel, and Paris Georgia, see all the Oceania brands that are catching our eyes.  This New Zealand brand counts top models like Kendall Jenner, Lily Aldridge and Georgia Fowler as fans. It's easy to see why, their sleek designs are uncomplicated, and instant wardrobe staples.

SHOP NOW Launched in 2008, Aje has seen major success thanks to the street style set (like Bettina Looney) who rely on their effortless frocks that are still impactful enough to make the photographers coming running during fashion week.   ¬† It's only been three years since launching her eponymous line, but this New Zealand native is making an impact not just on our wardrobes but also on the environment. Sustainability is just ingrained into the culture of her brand, from ethically sourced fabrics, to spotlighting factory workers that help produce the brand with care.  During the spring 2020 shows, from New York to Paris you couldn't walk into a fashion show without seeing It girls in Esber's "negative space" dress. The brand fuses masculine and feminine details into an ultra modern collection that exudes a quiet confidence.   ¬† Best friends Sophie Coote and Nikki Campbell translate Australia's signature style into closet must-haves from gauzy white tops to petite floral separates.  ¬† Designer Anna Quan launched her label in 2011 under the principle "less is more"‚Äîand specializes in sourcing the finest fabrics and perfect tailoring that keeps the style set coming back for more.  This Aussie staple is another brand making a serious commitment to sustainability, clearly disclosing their production chain for customers to view.

 His Fall 2018 show in February will be the last shown during NYFW.  The mass exodus of designers leaving New York Fashion Week isn't slowing down anytime soon, and now the CFDA-helmed week is losing one of its biggest designers: Alexander Wang.  As WWD reports, the designer is opting out of the traditional NYFW calendar following the Fall 2018 shows this February. Moving forward, Wang will instead present his collections in June and December.  "Our customer will be better served through the new system. The innovative approach reframes product on the month that it ships, rather than the outdated labels of ‚Äòresort‚Äô or ‚Äòpre-fall,‚Äô giving our customers more relevant and consistent merchandise throughout the year," Lisa Gersh, CEO of Alexander Wang, told WWD.  Under the new format, collections shown in June will hit stores between October and March, while collections shown in December will be available to shop between April and September.  Wang's departure follows a growing list of designers who have already exited New York Fashion Week, including Proenza Schouler, Altuzarra, Public School, Rodarte, Thom Browne and more. This season's NYFW calendar will also be missing Tommy Hilfiger and Victoria Beckham, who are showing in Milan and London, respectively.  With his over-the-top after parties and #WANGFEST, however, Wang brought something especially unique to the usually subdued week of shows. Without his presence, it's unclear where exactly the future of New York Fashion Week is headed. As a result, the CFDA is considering the addition of a summer and winter season in New York, possibly launching this year in June and December (or July and January).  Steven Kolb, CEO of the CFDA, told WWD the plan is still very much up in the air, but conversations are in the works, "The idea is, could there be a core group of brands that sat well together and combined their interests to do something during pre-collections?" "I think for it to have any significance in terms of making a mark, I could see a collective of maybe five or so brands that have the right adjacency and might align to it," Kolb added.  For now, it seems the future of the traditional NYFW calendar will remain uncertain...
 A real mood.   While attending Paris Fashion Week, Bella Hadid and Kendall Jenner had an epic date night last night. And just like your typical date night, there were red hot matching dresses, models galore, and wine glasses carried to-go down the streets of Paris.  In lieu of handbags, the models channeled their inner Rihanna and carried wine glasses out of their Paris hotel. Bad Gal Riri, a real pioneer for accessorizing with wine glasses, has been spotted carrying her drinks to-go for years now.  
  Not only did Bella and Kendall give us some major Rihanna vibes, but their night out also channeled another iconic BFF drinking moment in history. Back in 2003, Cameron Diaz and Drew Barrymore were spotted carrying an open bottle of champagne and two glasses down the streets of New York for an epic girls night out. Let's take a moment to remember the real OGs here: Along with their must-have wine glass accessories, the It models also served up some looks in coordinating red dresses. Kendall opted for a sparkling one-shouldered dress by Alexandre Vauthier paired with clear PVC heels. Bella, on the other hand, went for a bit more buttoned-up look in a long-sleeve collared dress by Emilio Pucci and colorful patent heels. She accessorized with an orange croc Dorateymur shoulder bag, which still allowed her to carry her wine because, priorities.  The duo was attending a Paris Fashion Week party hosted by YouTube alongside Karlie Kloss, Joan Smalls, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, and more of the fashion crowd. 
 Her son, Presley Gerber, will also make an appearance. Cindy Crawford is recreating her iconic 1992 Pepsi commercial for this year's Super Bowl. The new iteration arrives 26 years after the original, and will costar her 18-year-old son, Presley Gerber. The full ad will debut on February 4, the night of the big game, but Pepsi already teased a photo from the TV spot.  Like she does in the original, Crawford  sips a Pepsi at a gas station, but that signature white tank top is missing. This time, she's sporting a denim shirt. The new ad will also include footage from Michael Jackson's dance-filled Pepsi commercial from 1984. The supermodel, 51, was excited to work with her son for the project. "Just as a mother, we drove to work together that day and we shared the same trailer. And when he was doing his thing, I was just a proud mom watching from the sidelines, trying not to annoy him," she told the Associated Press yesterday. We're still waiting for a joint ad between her and her 16-year-old daughter, Kaia, who's become a breakout star on the runways. Crawford is aware that her Pepsi spot has become a pop culture classic. "It was one of those moments in my career that when I walked down the street, people were like, 'Pepsi!' Or I'd be at a bar and people would send me over a Pepsi," she told AP. She's even seen women channel the ad for an easy Halloween costume. This isn't Crawford's first time revisiting the commercial, however. In 2016, she parodied the ad on The Late Late Show with James Corden, which featured the late-night host in the same tank top and cutoff denim shorts.  The Associated Press contributed reporting. 
 The model has opened up about her famous ex in a new interview.  In a new interview with PORTER magazine, Gisele B√ºndchen has finally opened up about a plethora of topics‚Äîfrom her incredible career as a Victoria's Secret model, to what life is like with her husband Tom Brady. But one subject that fans might not have expected the supermodel to discuss at length is her former relationship with Hollywood heartthrob, Leonardo DiCaprio. In the incredibly honest interview, B√ºndchen reveals that her split from the famous actor in 2005 came at a difficult time in her life. Having faced anxiety, which included having panic attacks, the model realized that she needed to make some major changes if she wanted to feel better.  Per  PORTER, B√ºndchen "had lost control of herself entirely; she was living out of a suitcase, subsisting on mocha Frappuccinos, cigarettes and wine. A doctor suggested Xanax, but she didn‚Äôt want to take a pill. Instead, she imposed strict new rules to force herself out of the cycle." The model's new rules included, "No sugar, no caffeine, no alcohol," cutting back on work commitments, and beginning instruction with a yoga teacher.   As for why she ended her relationship with DiCaprio, B√ºndchen tells PORTER, "No longer numbing myself with smoking, drinking and too much work, I was becoming more and more aware of things that I‚Äôd chosen not to look at. Was I alone in wanting to do some serious soul-searching while he stayed the same? In the end, unfortunately, the answer was yes." Of course, B√ºndchen has since moved on. Per E! News, the model went on a blind date with Brady in December 2006, and ended up marrying him in April 2009. Brady and B√ºndchen have since welcomed two children‚Äîson Benjamin, who was born in December 2009, and daughter Vivian in December 2012. Brady has another son, John, from his previous relationship with Bridget Moynahan. SUBSCRIBE

 From to Dior to Chanel, all the runway highlights from the fall collections in Paris.  Bonjour, Paris: the final leg of Fashion Month is here. As the Fall 2019 collections hit the runways in the French capital, we're highlighting all the standout looks along the way. From Dior to Chanel, these are the runway looks that will shape next season's biggest trends.  The Centre Pompidou, Paris' epicenter of modern and contemporary art, served as a primary source of inspiration for Nicolas GhesquieÃÄre this season, as did "Culture" more loosely, which he describes as "what we see, what we accept,what we learn. What‚Äôs left to us..."And rather than look to the oh-so-haute Louvre, the designer chose a more urban, modern, downtown approach. As his show notes began, "perceptions shift..." And shift they did, although GhesquieÃÄre's girl is still the tough, mini-skirt-wearing girl she has been for seasons.  For Fall 2019, the designer paired bold shoulders, ruffles, sparkles, and other fanciful elements with grungier street elements for a mix that feels resemblant of the streets. He also played with a piece of every bold tone for a reason‚Äî"Green is water, blue is air, yellow is electricity. Red is human."‚Äîbut used them sporadically. For the most part, this is still the cool-kid Vuitton girl you've come to know and love; she's just expanding her horizons. ‚ÄîCarrie Goldberg Television screens surrounded the Miu Miu runway, looping old school VHS imagery including such disparate themes as Mariah Carey, random nudes, cats, and blooming flowers. The whole look was very mid-‚Äò90s MTV. The clothing vibed on that idea a bit but not too literally with a cool, young mix‚Äîcamo and shearling jackets, some pop floral slim maxi skirts, layered leather mini skirts, and sheer puff sleeve mini dresses. A black velvet cape and anorak cape-jacket hybrids were standouts. At the end of the show, models walked to Dolly Patton‚Äôs rendition of "Stairway to Heaven," further proof that sometimes it‚Äôs the unexpected pairings that really soar. ‚ÄîKerry Pieri Karl Lagerfeld‚Äôs final collection for Chanel, designed before he passed away last month, walked at the Grand Palais today on a bed of faux snow, next to trees and charming chalet houses against a backdrop of snow capped mountains. A moment of silence and a recording of the posthumous designer speaking before the collection walked served as tribute‚Äîbut as a drawing of Coo Chanel and Karl Largerfeld sketched by the late designer at each seat read, ‚ÄúThe Beat Goes On.‚Äù  Chanel is a joyous brand and this collection brought that joy,  apr√®s-ski style. The Chanel woman is a true traveler, who requires a wardrobe for each of her fabulous destinations, including the world's chicest mountaintops. Whether that be Gstaad, Aspen, or Hokkaido, she‚Äôs certainly covered in puffer jackets, black and white tweeds, white suiting, a furry snow cape, fair isle sweaters and snow boots, bien sur.  Penelope Cruz helped close the show in an ice queen-worthy mini dress before models walked to0 "We Could Be Heroes" by David Bowie, the same song which closed Karl's last show for Fendi in Milan. Karl will always be missed but he was most certainly still felt today. ‚ÄîKerry Pieri For Fall, Sarah Burton looked back to her hometown in Northern England for inspiration. In her show notes, the creative director revealed she brought her team to the countryside and mill towns in which she grew up, leading to a collection inspired by ‚Äúthe bolts of cloth we saw woven both by man and machine.‚Äù  The end result was a garden party of new sorts‚Äîone that traded in traditional floral print frocks for futuristic, couture-like roses that came to life in new form. There were 3-D florals that blossomed as the exaggerated shoulders of an ‚Äò80s-inspired jacket and a series of belted pouf dresses. A range of metallic looks‚Äîfrom jewel-encrusted suiting to chain evening wear‚Äîleaned towards the futuristic, machine-driven aspect of the collection. All together, it was a stunning contrast of old meets new, delicate meets tough, and nature meets technology. ‚ÄîLauren Alexis Fisher Giambattista Valli has long mastered the art of swoon-worthy dresses‚Äîand his Fall 2019 collection was no exception. A masculine-meets-feminine juxtaposition set the tone for the collection, with boxy tailored suits sprinkled in-between flouncy floral dresses and gowns. It was the range of colorful print dresses accessorized with floral neck scarves and fanciful feathered shoes that stood out most, however. Puffed sleeves and strong shoulders served as the main focal points, echoing the ongoing ‚Äò80s revival that doesn‚Äôt appear to be slowing down anytime soon‚Äîmuch to our delight. ‚ÄîLauren Alexis Fisher 
 Only if we can wear these Jacquemus boots though.  White boot season is upon us, according to Hailey Bieber. The 22-year-old model sported the favorite fall trend yesterday while out in Los Angeles with a chic, '90s-inspired outfit‚Äîminus the pants.   Hailey layered an oversized J Brand x Elsa Hosk leather blazer over a long, cotton MM6 Maison Margiela T-shirt. And although her bottoms were either MIA or hiding under her shirt, she kept her legs partially covered with a pair of white fold-over boots by Jacquemus. Additional accessories included Celine square cat-eye sunglasses, gold hoop earrings, a gold watch, and a black leather bag from the Alexander Wang x Bvlgari collaboration. To complete the nostalgic aesthetic, she kept her hair in a laid-back updo with a jaw clip.    Hailey and husband Justin Bieber, who legally married a year ago, are reportedly having their religious ceremony this month. Will the model wear an equally modern and risqu√© bridal look, or will she opt for something more traditional?    Hailey recently opened up about the rocky start of her modeling career and how she used to feel "inferior" to her friends‚Äîlike Kendall Jenner, Gigi Hadid, and Bella Hadid‚Äîbecause they were taller and booking more runway jobs. "My burn in the modeling industry has been slow and I've had to learn to be okay with that," Hailey told Vogue Australia.  She added, "You can make it work and not have to do runway, and I've done a good job with that. I'm proud of myself for building a more commercial career that worked for me and being confident about it."
 But she's still inspiring women to love their bodies. Sixteen-year-old Natalie Nootenboom made her runway debut earlier this month during New York Fashion Week, and made history as the first plus-size model to ever walk for Anna Sui. But her record-breaking achievement came with its downsides‚Äîwhen the first-timer arrived backstage, people thought she was part of the crew. "I did get a few looks," Nootenboom told The Hollywood Reporter. "But I get it, I was the first plus-sized model to walk for Anna Sui." The model, who's also the niece of DJ-turned-designer Steve Aoki, had to clarify to some crew members that she was walking in the show, not working backstage for it. "It was uncomfortable at first. Being the first of anything requires a little uncomfortability," she explained in a separate interview with ELLE.com.  In case you missed it here's an edit of my walk for Anna Sui's #nyfw show. I remember I would always play this song and daydream about walking on a runway and the day has finally come! Thank you so much @annasui  and I am so honored to be chosen  to be your first plus model to walk your show! ‚ù§Ô∏è A post shared by  ùêçùêöùê≠ùêöùê•ùê¢ùêû . (@natalienootenboom) on Sep 11, 2017 at 11:01pm PDT Nootenboom won't let that initial rough patch get in the way of her goal to inspire other curvy women to embrace their bodies. "I felt out of place when I first got there," she told THR, "but I just remembered that I‚Äôm making a place for curvy girls." The fashion world has been getting better representing plus-size women on the runways. There were 90 plus-size model appearances this NYFW, a significant improvement from the 26 last season, according to The Fashion Spot's diversity report. Twelve out of the 94 shows surveyed in the study featured curvy women, but that includes plus-size lines like Addition Elle and Torrid.  Nootenboom's debut also defies body image norms on a more specific level, as she challenges stereotypes that Asian women are all skinny and petite. The model, who is of Japanese descent, revealed that she received plenty of thank-yous from fellow Asian women on social media after making her runway debut.  She recalled one emotional exchange: "I got this one elderly lady who told me, 'I wish there was someone like you representing us when I was young.'"  We hope to see Nootenboom on many more runways to come.
 Floral dresses, sequin animal prints, sexy swimwear‚Äîneed we say more? London-based RIXO is no stranger to ShopBAZAAR. We‚Äôve been smitten with the line‚Äôs vintage-inspired pieces since day one and continuously collaborated with co-founders (and BFFs), Henrietta Rix and Orlagh McCloskey, for exclusives and amazing features. With a growing list of devoted followers that include editors, influencers and celebs, this is the buzzy brand you need to add to your closet if you haven‚Äôt already. We talked to RIXO about their beginnings, the ShopBAZAAR Hero and what‚Äôs next. Describe the beginnings of the brand. Orlagh: We met at university‚Äîwe were both studying at London College of Fashion in the same Fashion Management course. We bonded over our shared love of vintage and became best friends straight away.  Henrietta: We‚Äôd scour charity shops and vintage fairs together all over London, parts of the UK, and even abroad (whenever we went on holiday together) hunting for vintage treasures‚Äîwe still make time to fit this in now! Whenever we go anywhere, the first thing we do is look up where the local vintage shops and flea markets are. We get so much inspiration from different cultures and countries we visit. Orlagh: We had the initial idea at university after working on a project together. After that, it was only a matter of time before we set up RIXO. As soon as we graduated in 2014, we worked behind-the-scenes for RIXO on weekends and evenings‚Äîevery spare minute we had that we weren‚Äôt working at our other jobs! Eventually we quit our jobs and RIXO was launched from our university house in September 2015.      RIXO dress, $400, shopbazaar.com  SHOP NOW Style tips for wearing the ShopBAZAAR Hero?Henrietta: Our Coleen dress is a really versatile transitional piece, no matter the season or time of day. Wear it casually in the winter months with trainers or boots and layered with an oversized knit jumper on top. For evening or a special occasion, remove your jumper and throw on a pair of heels to dress it up. Due to the lightweight silk fabric, worn on its own with flats or sandals, our Coleen dress will see you right through the warmer months too or if you‚Äôre heading to a sunnier climate to escape the cold! In the past few years, RIXO has gained a huge following with editors, celebs and influencers making the brand their go-to‚Äîwhat do you think is the main reason for this?Orlagh: It‚Äôs a mixture of design, quality, and price-point all amalgamated together. All of our pieces are high-quality and mostly 100% silk and our prints are all hand-painted, so that also gives us a really strong, personal brand identity that people recognise. I design every print and so, because it‚Äôs always my hand and my handwriting, it will always look like a RIXO piece. Our shapes are also flattering and very unique to us. Additionally, we don‚Äôt have investors; RIXO is self-funded by both Henrietta and I. Therefore, unlike other brands we don‚Äôt work to a certain margin for pricing. We work backwards, looking first at what we think the true value of something is and what we would be happy to pay for it ourselves as a customer.  Henrietta: We feel so passionately about not being greedy and ensuring it‚Äôs the end customer that gets the true value for money! Instagram has also played a part in our growth and ability to reach new global audiences. It‚Äôs something we have handled personally from the beginning‚Äîit has all been very organic. Since we launched our Instagram I‚Äôve manage it entirely and I think part of the success is because it‚Äôs our own personal stream of thought and no one else is posting, commenting or replying on our behalf. I try to reply to all of our DMs or comments and also proactively like and comment on posts of people wearing RIXO who have used our #HumansOfRIXO hashtag. Our account is really inclusive, personal, and natural; we‚Äôre not trying to be something we‚Äôre not or alienate a certain customer‚ÄîI think people connect with that.Biggest hurdle you had to overcome to make your business work?Henrietta: We are completely self-funded and hopefully as two young, determined hard working women, we can keep it that way. We feel really passionate about business as well as design and growing RIXO ourselves, without investors, in an organic manor. When we first started RIXO in 2015, it was just Orlagh and I doing everything ourselves, right up until this past year‚Äîfrom launching an e-commerce website to designing and marketing to packing and sending the orders customers made on rixo.co.uk. Not having funding or help meant all the workload and decisions about the business were left completely to us, which of course was challenging‚Äîwe had to completely give up our personal lives for a while. However, it was the best thing we could have done! Not having anyone else to answer to meant that we could be agile, make decisions quickly, create pieces that we really loved, and focus on areas of the business that we knew would help drive success. Orlagh: In the first six months of starting the brand, it was a challenge getting people to understand the ethos of the brand without having product to show them. As soon as we had product it was easier to show them what RIXO was about. How do you see your brand growing/evolving? Henrietta: We‚Äôre expanding into new categories so people can shop the whole RIXO look. We just launched swim and beach cover-ups and in February we launch our first accessories category, including handbags, belts, jewellery, neck scarves, and hair accessories. Eventually our goal is to make RIXO a complete lifestyle brand.  Orlagh: The new categories are in response to the demand from our customers. We‚Äôd style up RIXO ready-to-wear pieces on rixo.co.uk with our own vintage accessories and we always had customers asking to buy the full looks‚Äîsometimes we‚Äôd end up selling or loaning out our own vintage belts and bags to customers who were coveting them.Powerful advice your received?Henrietta: Be willing to put the brand above everything else. We gave up our twenties for RIXO and there‚Äôs no sign of slowing down. You have to be completely immersed and passionate about your brand, otherwise the long hours and sacrifices you have to make will get the better of you.  Orlagh: Follow your gut! We‚Äôve made lots of decisions in the past based on what we felt was right for the brand, against what sometimes was advised by others who perhaps had more experience than us. No one knows your brand better than you!     What's next?Henrietta: In February we are launching an accessories collection for the first time within our Spring/ Summer 2019 collection. Our SS19 accessories, like ready-to-wear, are vintage inspired and feature our hand-painted prints. There‚Äôs bold printed scrunchies, decorative chain belts with shell detailing, Napa leather and printed bags with chain bracelet handles and shell closures, as well as decadent ‚Äò80s inspired costume jewellery (the bigger the better!). Orlagh: Our upcoming SS19 collection ‚ÄòLove Over Gold‚Äô, a nod to Princess Diana‚Äôs favourite Dire Straits album, is inspired by our favourite ‚Äò80s icons‚ÄîPrincess Diana, Jerry Hall, Brooke Shields, Madonna‚Ä¶ We created pieces that we could imagine those icons wearing back in their heyday, but with a contemporary twist. From Jerry Hall supermodel glam pieces with sweetheart neckline and clashing prints, to demurer Princess Diana inspired co-ords, silk midi skirts, and midi day dresses with high necklines and balloon sleeves. It‚Äôs exciting because there‚Äôs a wider variation of shapes and prints in this collection‚Äîmaxi polka dots, pastel tone animal prints, abstract florals, multi-coloured houndstooth and ‚Äò80s style chain print. Plus, it‚Äôs the first time we‚Äôll be launching RIXO accessories!

Meghan Markle continued her busy week of royal engagements by attending the Invictus Games Sydney celebration reception in London today with Prince Harry.

 Did you meet the world in plaid flannel or bell bottoms? Fashion changes at a rapid pace. When we say the '80s, everyone thinks of big shoulders and Madonna, but each year of each decade had its own unique sartorial mood. See what was at the top of the style conversation the year you were welcomed into the world. The question remains: Are you more or less likely to embrace the choker if Victoria Beckham was wearing it in the year of your birth? The Summer of Love was in full swing as was the Vietnam War. Girls like supermodel Twiggy were rocking mini skirts, often with matching or coordinating tops. It was a year of smart camel coats, Love Story and strong female silhouettes. Take note from a post-White House Jackie Kennedy in this dream jacket and cross-body bag to really pinpoint the vibe. Everyone was embracing stripes, good suiting and a solid wide brim hat. Women in ties was optional, but gave a good indication that Women's Lib was alive and well. A great wide collar was perfect for disco dancing. Bianca Jagger proved that embracing menswear shapes for women, as pioneered by Yves Saint Laurent's Le Smoking was all the rage. Obviously, this idea endures. The bell bottom was just the thing for men and women. It was all about showing your curves and making room for a big platform shoe underneath those roomy hems. It wasn't all suiting and menswear inspired in the 1970s. Off the shoulder-easy breezy dresses were having a moment. All the better in white cotton. The world saw the end of the Vietnam War and the rise of platform sandals, mini dresses and turtlenecks for layering. There was an ice-skater vibe in fashion and the price of a brand new Mustang was just over $4,000.   The Apple Computer Company formed and Charlie's Angels premiered on TV. Women were wearing shirt dresses, midi skirts and pussy bow blouses. Feathering your hair was an unofficial mandate. Spain held its first democratic election in 41 years, the Trans Alaskan Oil Pipeline opened and Saturday Night Fever hit the big screen. Ladies wore a little sparkle whereever they could, smart, slouchy turtlenecks and anything that you could do the Hustle in. If you weren't wearing a giant collar and fitted vest in 1978, who even were you? Harvey Milk became the first openly gay person elected to public office in California and Fleetwood Mac was at the top of the charts.  It was two more years before nothing could get between Brooke Shields and her Calvins but dark, fitted denim was already everywhere. Everyone was reading  The Hitchhiker‚Äôs Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams and life expectancy for males was 70 years old.  It was gold lam√© or bust, baby and the question on everyone's lips was ‚ÄúWho Shot J.R.?‚Äù It was all glamour and glitz and looking like the richest girl in the room. Consider it the precursor to today's athleisure boom. It was all about a Jane Fonda-style workout with the leotard and leg warmers to match. Heather Locklear pulled it all off with particular aplomb. A lace portrait collar and smart velvet with a statement shoulder was just the sort of tasteful look royals and non-royals alike favored. This was a time when the world was falling in love with Princess Di and happily hadn't embraced neon yet. Pick your polka dot, any polka dot. Black, white and red was having a graphic moment, shoulders were still big and a wasp waist was everything. Everyone was naming their daughters  Jennifer, Jessica, Amanda or Ashley. Everyone was still feeling the sartorial affects of "Flashdance." Off the shoulder sweaters and stir up leggings hit the masses. Christie Brinkley was the supermodel of the moment and Vanessa Williams became the first black Miss America.  It was all about big hair, the slouch boot and "Girls Just Want to Have Fun." Mikhail Gorbachev became the leader of the Soviet Union and Michael Jordan was named "Rookie of the Year" in the NBA.  It was only one look of Madonna's many looks, but it was a big one. Off the shoulder velvet and a lot of taffeta made appearances at proms all over America. Girls were wearing their boyfriends' leather jackets and it was all about a good pump.  For every primary color and fuchsia silk rosette available, there was also a sleek buttoned-up moment in fashion. Brows were bold, cheekbones were high and so were collars. Heavy jewelry was a must and Whitney Houston just wanted to dance with somebody.  The sleek skirt suit, preferable in a color of the rainbow was in every power woman closet. "Working Girl" was in theaters and it wasn't out of the question to throw on that suit with some slouch socks and sneakers. The glass ceiling was just beginning to show cracks and Wall Street was booming. It was all about getting a jacket that could stop traffic, jewelry with gem stones to spare and, if you're really feeling special, gloves as accessory. George H.W. Bush became president, Michael Keaton was Batman and Paula Abdul was Forever Your Girl. Welcome to the year of layered necklaces and chain belts. Fashion in general was more toned down than in the '80s‚Äîwith an emphasis on basic white blouses and black trousers rather than over-the-top wide shoulder jackets and crazy colors.  "Cheers" and "Designing Women" were on TV and Julia Roberts was the It-girl, wearing oversized blazers, natural makeup and simple gold hoops. Everything was understated and cool and the edgy youth were listening to Nirvana‚Äôs Nevermind. The designer to wear was Versace, Versace, Versace. Black and gold form-fitting looks with major sex appeal were everywhere as was the high, slick pony tail. The Bodyguard was the soundtrack to listen to and the movie to see. It was a year to look like you were headed directly from school to a rave, from work to a rave, or from the dentist, directly to a rave. Life was a Delia's catalogue with overalls, rainbow everything, patches and floppy hats. It's also the year Coachella began, thanks to Pearl Jam.  Marc Jacobs was the designer to know, My So Called Life was premiering and plaid flannel was already emerging along with grunge bands. Cindy Crawford was the supermodel of the moment and unnatural red hair was the color to have. Minimalism was one of the major looks of the decade, with Carolyn Bessette as one of its greatest champions. Calvin Klein ruled, as did black and white and clean lines. Shoes were the simple mule or Doc Martens. Little tiny sunglasses were everywhere, as were striped highlights for men and women. Girls wore their button-downs open at the bottom, Beanie Babies reached fever pitch and the top songs were "Don't Speak" by No Doubt and "Wannabe" by the Spice Girls. You couldn't walk a city block without seeing at least a few vibrant track suits. Musicians were the greatest style inspiration, including singer Aaliyah, who favored cropped tops‚Äîalong with every other girl with good abs. It also wasn't unlikely to see men's underwear bands peeking out of everyone's pants. Butterfly clips, chain mail tops and pleather pants added up to a great look in 1998. Makeup had a general silver sheen to it and and the haircut to have was the "Something About Mary" bob. 
 We've got moves you've never seen before... Get your spring style story straight‚Äîfrom the perfect little red dress, to statement tops, and a new take on the boyfriend blazer. Get inspired by the ladies who wear them well and shop the looks.  Chloe is a vision in red with white accessories in this killer Khaite dress with an unexpected drop waist. This spring-ready piece is the ideal day to night, winter to spring transition piece. It's all about a little drama and ease in wearability. A little Victorian, a little modern. Wear it with boots now and sandals later. While they have a more utilitarian rep, a great pair of slouchy khakis is anything but boring. Indya Moore proves they're the perfect balance for even the sexiest tops.  A subtle cargo pocket and slouchy fit put these right at the top of our spring wish list.¬† The boyfriend jacket is now worn best with a strong shoulder, in a light hue. We love how Rihanna styled hers with a slip dress and minimal sandals. This jacket will take you through spring over denim, with coordinating trousers for a suiting look, over dresses a la Rihanna. The options are endless. An ultra luxe jumpsuit, like this Ralph Lauren one on Rosie Huntington Whiteley, is a spring must. Gilded accessories only up the chic ante. Easy but elegant. Has there ever been a better combo? The most modern spring uniform is a great blazer paired with biker shorts, seen here on Marion Cotillard in Chanel.  These sleek babies are meant to be dressed up. It's all about the balance of a great jacket.¬† Cara Santana knows the quickest way to look pulled-together is a sleek bun and a tweedy menswear-inspired suit. The hoops are just a bonus. This pinstripe number also¬†has coordinating pants, which leads to nearly endless combinations of smart looks. A subtle statement dress with a sleeve is just the thing as temps get higher. A pretty print makes it that much better. We love the idea of this dress with a white slouchy boot. A relaxed jean with cowboy boots and cashmere turtleneck sweater is the exact transition look we have in mind. Kaia Gerber looks beyond cool in it.  Finding the right oversized jean isn't easy‚Äîbut we have you covered with this slightly distressed pair. A shift dress is a modern option for evening at the moment. Go bold a la Gigi in Prada and try a knee-high sock. It's fashion but fun. This charming dress is work (with tights!)¬†to weekend approved.¬†¬† Pairing neutral pieces together is elongating‚Äîand signifies the turn of seasons. We love Bella's double breasted, 80s inspired jacket. This pencil skirt will provide that same elongating vibe‚Äîjust pair with a coordinating bodysuit or knit. Statement tops are here to stay. Take note from Bettina Looney and wear your bold shoulders with pride. Get a similar vibe in a great dress with a statement sleeve.¬†
 Christine Centenera and Josh Goot's pared-down collection is also getting the denim treatment. WARDROBE.NYC capsule collections are a one-stop shop to looking like the coolest kid in the room. Designer Josh Goot and stylist Christine Centenera founded the direct-to-consumer brand with the concept that each drop would be sold only in fixed four- and eight-piece wardrobe sets through the brand‚Äôs website and New York concept store. It‚Äôs an innovative idea and appealing to many, but  also somewhat limiting to shoppers who just want those perfect bike shorts. Now the individual pieces will be available at Matchesfashion.com and the brand‚Äôs site.‚ÄúThe concept of WARDROBE.NYC as a brand that was designed in capsules to build the perfect wardrobe, was something that we found incredibly innovative,‚Äù Natalie Kingham, the fashion and buying director at Matchesfashion.com, said in a release. The e-comm site will also be releasing the brand‚Äôs first denim collaboration with Levi‚Äôs, as well as select items from past Releases 01 TAILORED, 02 SPORT, and 03 STREET.A slim stovepipe style, pencil skirt, and bold shouldered denim shirt are standouts from the denim collaboration. ‚ÄúLevi‚Äôs heritage and cultural significance, combined with their design team and resources in San Francisco, allowed us to explore our own notion of democratic luxury‚Äîcreating a denim wardrobe concept that felt new and elevated,‚Äù co-founder Goot tells BAZAAR.com. As for a chic minimal trench, easy oversized blazers, and button-downs that make up more of Release 04, Centenera explains, ‚ÄúRelease 04 is inspired by the idea of a new classic wardrobe. We all wear denim, and we wanted to distill the perfect pieces for a modern wardrobe‚Äîreinterpreted Levi‚Äôs denim as the foundation, backed with luxury jersey staples and Italian‚Äìmade tailored essentials.‚ÄùAs for the design duo‚Äôs overall denim philosophy? ‚ÄúPractical urban minimalism,‚Äù Goot answers.

 The model will walk in the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show in November. Another model will be gracing the runway alongside the Victoria's Secret Angels this November. In an extremely moving Instagram post this weekend, Winnie Harlow revealed that she'd been cast in the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show, and would finally be making her debut as a VS Model. Taking to Instagram to announce the news, Harlow described how nervous she was going into the casting at Victoria's Secret, and how she was "beyond honored to be given the opportunity to try out." Clearly, everyone was impressed with Harlow, as she will be walking as one of the Victoria's Secret Angels this fall. Overwhelmed by the magnitude of the accomplishment, Harlow thanked just about everybody in her Instagram announcement, most of all pointing "to my fans who have been pushing me forward to this point in my career."   S H A N G H A I üíôüá®üá≥ A post shared by  ‚ôîJamaican Canadian‚ôî (@winnieharlow) on Sep 4, 2018 at 2:49am PDT  Harlow also revealed, "I can‚Äôt believe this!! Thank you for giving me all the energy and kindness in that room! Thank you for allowing me to walk for VICTORIA‚ÄôS SECRET!" From her appearance on America's Next Top Model, to her uncensored Instagram presence, Harlow has been making a huge impact on the world. Outspoken about her vitiligo, a condition that results in the loss of skin color in patches, Harlow's fierce attitude and unmistakeable style make her a perfect fit for Victoria's Secret.   ü¶Å the real difference isn't my skin. It's the fact that I don't find my beauty in the opinions of others. I'm beautiful because I know it. Celebrate Your unique beauty today (& everyday)! A post shared by  ‚ôîJamaican Canadian‚ôî (@winnieharlow) on Aug 16, 2017 at 8:10am PDT You can even watch a video of the moment that Harlow found out that she'd been cast as a Victoria's Secret Model, and it's clear that one of her biggest dreams had come true.
 Oh yeah, literally while walking in the show. Does Gucci ever learn from their previous mistakes? First, the brand and its creative director, Alessandro Michele, received significant backlash in February after selling blackface clothing. Then, shortly after, the brand came under fire again in May for selling Sikh turbans online for $790. And now, the brand has messed up again‚Äîthis time, by showcasing clothing that seriously disregards people with mental health issues. During Milan Fashion Week, Gucci sent straitjacket and uniform-inspired looks down the runway for its spring/summer 2020 collection. And while this likely was not the brand's direct intention, it came off kind of callous to the point where a Gucci model named Ayesha Tan-Jones made a statement against the looks while walking the runway.  Before coming down the catwalk, Tan-Jones wrote, "Mental health is not  fashion" on their palms, and held their palms up for the show attendees to see as they came down the runway. Honestly, it was truly a badass moment of silent protest: After the show, Ayesha took to Instagram to make a full statement regarding the moment, and said that the stigma surrounding mental health and illness (especially towards PoC and LGBTQIA+ communities) needs to end. "I believe, as many fellow models do, that the stigma around mental health must end," they wrote. "As an artist and model who has experienced my own struggles with mental health, as well as family members and loved ones who have been affected by depression, anxiety, bipolar, and schizophrenia, it is hurtful and insensitive for a major fashion house such as Gucci to use this imagery as a concept for a fleeting fashion moment."  STATEMENT for my protest of the @gucci show ‚úäüèΩ MENTAL HEALTH IS NOT FASHION A post shared by  YaYa Bones (@ayeshatanjones) on Sep 22, 2019 at 8:23am PDT After Sunday's show, Alessandro Michele made a statement pertaining to the fashion faux-pas and said that the straitjacket-inspired looks were really just a very extreme version of a uniform. ‚ÄúFor me, the show was the journey from conformity to freedom and creativity,‚Äù Alessandro told The New York Times. ‚ÄúUniforms, utilitarian clothes, such straitjackets, were included in the fashion show as the most extreme version of restriction imposed by society and those who control it. These clothes were a statement for the fashion show and part of a performance.‚Äù  Given the nature of the show, Alessandro added that Ayesha was free to protest the looks. Thankfully, these Gucci pieces will not be sold online, but we can only hope that the brand does better with sensitive issues like mental health in the future.

 As Stranger Things returns for a second season, stars Noah Schnapp and Finn Wolfhard experience a close encounter of the fashion kind. Fall 2017 is a season of bizarre, gorgeously bonkers fashion. I dare you to toss convention out the window and join the new freakfest. There are many advantages to going strange. First and foremost, strange clothing is empowering. Nobody messes with a strange person. I regularly test this theory on the New York subway. Whenever I board the A train in a strange outfit‚Äîstripy socks with sandals, flowery man-blouses, straw sombreros, massive shades‚ÄîI precipitate a flurry of elbow nudges and anxious side-eyes. Too terrified to make eye contact, my fellow travelers immediately revert to playing Ballz on their smartphones. Sometimes people even cover their children‚Äôs eyes. By dressing as if I am totally unhinged, I get total r-e-s-p-e-c-t. Another benefit: When you dress strangely, you keep the spotlight where it should be‚Äîon YOU. Everyone else on the planet is so busy trying to look that you, with your eccentric fashion choices, are able to be an utter raving, screaming standout, unless, of course, Daphne Guinness, RiRi, Tilda Swinton, or Lady Gaga is in the vicinity. ‚ÄúWhen you dress strangely, you keep the spotlight where it should be‚Äîon YOU.‚Äù But perhaps the greatest benefit of dressing strangely is that it affords you, the wearer, endless opportunities for creative expression and experimentation, thereby providing you with a hobby. You become your own work of art. While others recoil in horror at the notion of prints, you can spend hours mashing them up with crazy artistic abandon. While others are oppressed by pedestrian notions of season-appropriate dressing, you, liberated you, can concoct endless alternative approaches, such as wearing furs in summer, and bikinis on the tundra. (Don‚Äôt blame me if you catch pneumonia.) And dressing strangely doesn‚Äôt have to break the bank. Bust an arm off your spectacles and replace it with a pink toothbrush, and you‚Äôll see exactly what I mean. Wearing your existing wardrobe in unexpected ways will also hit the spot: All Little Edie Bouvier Beale had to do was tie a blouse on her head and turn her skirt upside down‚ÄîI‚Äôm referring to the strange heroine of the classic documentary‚Äîand she became a perennial fashion icon. All C√©line Dion had to do was wear a jacket backward. #Dior. Revolving or inverting your garments is one low-cost way to get results; improbable layering is another. In our society, convention dictates that certain things are worn over certain other things. Cardigans are worn over blouses, as sure as day follows night. Deviating from these precepts is an affordable way of looking offbeat. Skeptical? Try wearing your black brassiere on top of your Burberry duffle coat, and get back to me. Finally, let‚Äôs discuss your crowning glory: a jaunty chapeau. The donning of a batty hat‚Äîa tiara, a basket of fruit, a steering wheel!‚Äîis a fail-safe way to signal your strangeness. In the early 20th century, a lady named Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven delighted the denizens of Greenwich Village by wearing the lid of a filthy coal bucket on her head. Come summer, the taboo-busting Elsa would insert her head into a birdcage, complete with live canary. Her signature flourish? She might be the only person in history to have glued postage stamps to her face. Dressing strangely is a great way to enter the history books. Back in the 1960s, a strange group of lads named the Doors had a big hit with a song titled ‚ÄúPeople Are Strange.‚Äù This haunting ditty became an anthem for all the counterculture freaks of my generation in our caftans and vintage finery (think Saint Laurent, circa late 2015). Unfortunately, it contains a blatant bit of fake news. I refer to the chorus, in which lead singer Jim Morrison sang the following lugubrious lyrics: ‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre strange/No one remembers your name.‚Äù NOT TRUE! Shove a birdcage on your head‚Äîor wear a dead swan to the Oscars‚Äî and you will be remembered forever. This article originally appears in the September 2017 issue of Harper's BAZAAR.

 Louis Vuitton's artistic director speaks out after the president visited a new Louis Vuitton factory. Louis Vuitton's artistic director, Nicolas Ghesqui√®re, pushed back against President Donald Trump's appearance at the opening of a new Louis Vuitton factory in Texas last week. During the visit, the president posed for a photo op alongside top executives from Louis Vuitton Moet-Hennessy, including Chief Executive Bernard Arnault and Louis Vuitton CEO Michael Burke.  Ghesqui√®re took to Instagram to denounce the ties between Trump and LVMH. Posting the album cover of Evelyn Thomas's 1984 hit, "High Energy," Ghesqui√®re captioned the photo, "Standing against any political action. I am a fashion designer refusing this association #trumpisajoke #homophobia"  Standing against any political action. I am a fashion designer refusing this association #trumpisajoke #homophobia A post shared by @ nicolasghesquiere on Oct 19, 2019 at 8:33pm PDT The event in question was the opening of a new Louis Vuitton factory in Texas. Trump was invited to attend, where he posed with LVMH Chief Executive Bernard Arnault and Louis Vuitton CEO Michael Burke for the ceremonial opening. Ivanka Trump also made an appearance and posed for the photo op.  Along with Louis Vuitton, LVMH owns 75 luxury, fashion, and beauty brands, including fashion houses like Christian Dior, Givenchy, Celine, and Loewe. The visit prompted immediate backlash online, spurring the hashtag #boycottlouisvuitton.  One user on Twitter wrote, "Yes, a man worth $70 billion has nothing to lose from Trump's policies. But people of color, immigrants, Muslims, women, and #LGBTQ communities are loosing too much. @lvmh #votewithyourwallet #boycottLOUISvuitton" Yes, a man worth $70 billion has nothing to loose from Trump's policies.

"This shows two commitments: One, the commitment of LVMH to the American market, and two, the commitment of President Trump to the American worker,‚Äù Arnault reportedly said. ‚ÄúI have always been close to the U.S. since the beginning of the Eighties when I lived here. You remember that France, a beautiful country, was becoming a little bit socialist at the time, and so I tried to find a country where business was welcome.

 Shop the look for less right now. Over the summer, bike shorts inspired by the late '80s and '90s (ahem, Princess Diana) made their way onto the street style scene (and just about every influencer's Instagram). But if you thought the trend would be short-lived, the Spring 2019 runways are predicting otherwise. After appearing on several major runways, bike shorts got the ultimate endorsement on the last day of Paris Fashion Week when Karl Lagerfeld (the man who once said "sweatpants are a sign of defeat") sent not just spandex shorts but full-on leggings down the Chanel runway. Now that they have the official Chanel seal of approval, it's time to shamelessly wear leggings as pants all season long. Consider the below your official guide to the best bike shorts and leggings to shop now.  Chanel styled classic bike shorts with structured jackets in all black to elevate the look and balance out the silhouette.  Whether you want to style them with an oversized blazer or perhaps actually work out in them¬†(a concept), these high-waisted bike shorts are the ideal length and¬†feature a flattering cut.¬† For a longer-length style, try Lane Bryant's bike shorts, which hit mid-knee. Upgrade the trend for fall with high-shine spandex that offers the look of leather.  Carbon38carbon38.com$68.00 SHOP NOW Add an oversized denim jacket and white t-shirt for an instantly cool look. Or just impress the hell out of everyone at Soul Cycle.  The leggings-as-pants debate has been raging since the the dawn of time. But Chanel made a case for the controversial stretch pants by styling them with oversized jackets and blazers f0r a more polished look. There's a reason these leggings have over 5,000 five-star reviews‚Äîthe high-waisted cut is extremely flattering, they're comfortable, and¬†you can dress them up or down.

 Their jeans will also save the environment 1,468 gallons of water per pair. Reformation has become the leader in sustainable fashion with style. Their flirty sundresses, jumpsuits and two-pieces have garnered an A-list fan base like Emily Ratajkowski, Rihanna, Karlie Kloss and many more.  In the last few years the brand has also expanded into petites, bridal and celebrity collaborations.  Now, the LA-based label is launching a full sister line called Reformation Jeans. As its title implied, the collection will consist of a 46-piece range of denim and sustainable basics like t-shirts and dresses. Denim happens to be one of the most environmentally harmful apparel items‚Äîa single pair alone typically uses 1,500 gallons of water.  Reformation's denim which will be made from deadstock and more sustainable fabrics will only require around 32 gallons, and eliminate the use of toxic dyes. Founder Yael Aflalo has also instated a charitable aspect, called The Wet Program‚Äîfor every jean purchased, they will clean a 1,000 gallons of water. Their first project is to help clean San Gabriel River which provides most Los Angeles residents with their water.  You can pre-order pieces starting today on thereformation.com.
 Because the bra is not the only scene-stealer. The Victoria's Secret Fashion Show was just filmed today ahead of its December 2nd airing. But photos of all the looks have come out, along with all the crazy, elaborate, bedazzled wings that the models wore with the lingerie. Here, the most over-the-top to come down the VS runway. 
From: ELLE US

 She said, "Making this decision now is the only fair outcome for my team and partners.‚Äù Ivanka Trump's eponymous fashion brand is shutting down, Wall Street Journal reports.  The move arrives over a year after Trump distanced herself from the company and became an unpaid advisor to her father, President Donald Trump, WSJ adds. The brand's 18 employees were told about the shutdown today. Sales for the Ivanka Trump brand grew after the 2016 election, but the label also came under fire by anti-Trump critics for its ties to the president. Department stores including Nordstrom, along with Canadian retailer Hudson's Bay, stopped selling the brand due to performance. A spokesperson from the former said "it didn‚Äôt make good business sense."   A source told Page Six that Ivanka's brand "never recovered" after she stepped away from the company to take on an official role in the White House in November 2016. She put the business in a trust run by family members, WSJ previously reported. Though she didn't keep a managerial role, she was still informed of finances and received a share of profits. Trump said she didn't sell the brand in order to protect its name (and hers). When the brand announced the separation, it said its "mission is not political‚Äîit never was and it never will be." However, business and politics still mixed. The President criticized Nordstrom for treating his daughter "so unfairly" when it dropped her line, and senior advisor Kellyanne Conway encouraged the public to "go buy Ivanka's stuff" in an interview.  Ivanka also often wore looks from her own label during day-to-day appearances at the White House. Whether it was intentional promotion or not, she served as what WSJ called a "walking billboard" for her brand.  In the past 18 months, Neiman Marcus and T.J. Maxx either scaled back on selling pieces from Ivanka's brand or changed the way they're merchandised in store, WSJ reports. However, companies like Lord & Taylor and Saks Off 5th continue to sell the line.  The Ivanka Trump brand is a private business and doesn't publicly disclose finances, but its sales at retailers like Amazon, Macy's Bloomingdales, and Zappos fell by 43 percent in the past year. According to disclosure forms from June, the trust is worth over $50 million and made $5 million in 2017. Seventeen months after working in Washington, the first daughter is unsure if she'll ever return to the retail business, "but I do know that my focus for the foreseeable future will be the work I am doing here in Washington,‚Äù she told WSJ. ‚ÄúSo making this decision now is the only fair outcome for my team and partners.‚Äù Trump's licensing agreements with the brand's parent company G-III will expire in the coming months, the newspaper adds. The umbrella company also owns labels like Calvin Klein, DKNY, Levi's, and Guess. BAZAAR.com has reached out to the Ivanka Trump brand for comment.

 The front row included Chelsea Clinton, Keira Knightley, and Kate Moss. Saturday saw Burberry's final show take place with Christopher Bailey at the helm. The star-studded event saw the former CEO and Chief Designer of Burberry, who'd worked at the fashion house for the last sixteen years, walk the runway himself. The show was dedicated to LGBTQ youth, and had a rainbow theme throughout. From a rainbow light show, to Cara Delevingne's jaw-dropping rainbow cape that closed the show, every detail was flawless. And with a front row of celebrities including Keira Knightley, Sienna Miller, Zendaya, Chelsea Clinton, and Idris Elba, Bailey's final show was an impressive celebration of his impact on the fashion world. Here's everything you need to know about Christopher Bailey's final Burberry show. Rainbow lights line the runway, focusing on Burberry's aim of highlighting LGBTQ youth. From left to right: James Righton (Keira Knightley's husband), Sienna Miller, Keira Knightley, Simon Woods, Chelsea Clinton, and Marc Mezvinsky, all watching Christopher Bailey's final Burberry show.

 He‚Äôll receive the award at a ceremony next year.  Ralph Lauren will be the first American fashion designer to ever be honored as Honorary Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (KBE) for his services to fashion and philanthropy. The prize will be presented to Lauren by a representative of Queen Elizabeth II at a ceremony next year. The award is fitting for Lauren, as his designs have been frequented by famous stylish royals, including Princess Diana, Kate Middleton, and Meghan Markle.  In addition to being a staple of American fashion for over 50 years, Lauren has also been a prominent philanthropist with a commitment to helping cancer patients access quality health care. The Ralph Lauren Corporation established the Nina Hyde Center for Breast Cancer Research at Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ralph Lauren Center for Cancer Care in Harlem, New York, and The Ralph Lauren Centre for Breast Cancer Research at the Royal Marsden Hospital in London. Lauren is joining the ranks of other accomplished Americans who've received the KBE, including President Dwight D. Eisenhower, President Ronald Reagan, President George H.W. Bush, Angelina Jolie, Steven Spielberg, Bill and Melinda Gates, and many more celebrities. ‚ÄúI   warmly   congratulate   Ralph   Lauren   on   this   award   that   recognizes   these   efforts   and achievements over the past 50 years,‚Äù said Antony Phillipson, British Consul General to New York and Her Majesty‚Äôs Trade Commissioner for North America, in a statement. This isn‚Äôt Lauren‚Äôs first honorable award, and it likely won't be the last. He‚Äôs also won CFDA's Womenswear and Menswear Designer of the Year and Member's Salute, the James Smithson Bicentennial Medal, the French Chevalier de la Legion d‚ÄôHonneur by the President of France, and the key to New York City from Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Lauren recently celebrated his 50th anniversary with a star-studded show and party in Central Park. The festivities included a stunning runway collection and almost every A-list star ‚Äî including a speech from Oprah. 
 A night of a thousand sequins... In Ralph Lauren custom Why we love it: It feels rare to get that "take your breath" away vibe on recent red carpets, but this simple black jumpsuit with elegant train detail is nothing short of a moment on the "Blackish" starlet. in Prada Why we love it: Unabashedly feminine in an unexpected shade of peach, this simple strapless creation is a no-fuss win. In Valentino Why we love it: It doesn't get more whimsical than pink and hearts, and we're all for celebrating femininity at its finest. In Miu Miu Why we love it: Robbie has had a veritable style extravaganza since I, Tonya first premiered and this feathered confection is another, well, chic feather in her fashion cap. In Calvin Klein by Appointment with Repossi jewelry Why we love it: Bringing some personality and youth to tonight's carpet, the Stranger Things actress manages to make white kicks and double buns look fresh and unfussy. In Dior Couture Why we love it: It's not often you see a print on the red carpet and this "written in the stars" motif is understated enough for major impact without overpowering the petite actress.  In Armani Why we love it: Chocolate sequins, rosette detail and long sleeves add up to a statuesque dream on the Aussie actress. In Oscar de la Renta Why we love it: Part '50s nostalgia, part modern glamour, Munn is 1000 watts in this black and silver number. In Louis Vuitton Why we love it: A little pink feels right on time in this futuristic frock with belt detail and just the right amount of paillettes. In Ralph and Russo Couture Why we love it: Embroidered, fringed and paired with '20s starlet hair, this is a gown that is as special as it is intricate.
 The line between making genuine political statements and cashing in on the resistance has become murky. We look at the designers getting it right. Immediately following the 2016 election, designers filled runways around the world with political statements. From Planned Parenthood pins at nearly every show and powerful slogan T-shirts at Prabal Gurung and Dior, to a march of pussy hats down the runway at Missoni, and even the casting of the Women's March co-founders at Mara Hoffman, designers didn‚Äôt shy away from creating protests of their own. One year later, the political resistance has only heightened and women's rights movements like #MeToo have gained global momentum. But the Fall 2018 runways, from New York to Paris, felt strangely apolitical and unreflective of the world around us.  At New York Fashion Week, there were no pink "Fashion Stands With Planned Parenthood" buttons or blue ACLU ribbons selected by the CFDA as an official cause, and out of 60 major fashion shows, only seven incorporated politics into their clothes, set design, or inspiration. Last year that number was closer to 25. Which begs the question: was last year's runway activism simply another trend?  "We decided to focus and deepen our civic commitment with an intensive study that will directly address the gender inequality we see across the industry,‚Äù explained Sophie Marx, CFDA‚Äôs Director of Marketing and Events, of the absence of political buttons and ribbons at this year‚Äôs NYFW. She added: ‚ÄúMoving forward, CFDA‚Äôs civic strategy will continue to give our members the opportunity to be a part of meaningful change." Meaningful change is indeed something that a few designers this year set out to accomplish, most of them touching upon feminism and the current political landscape lightly. Tom Ford sent "Pussy Power" bags and shoes down his runway, Prabal Gurung staged a powerful finale of women linking arms as #MeToo founder Tarana Burke sat front row, while Calvin Klein's show was a dark, apocalyptic-take on the current state of American politics. Taking things up a notch, Alice + Olivia's Stacey Bendet rewrote the Bill of Rights as "We The Women..." and used it as the backdrop for part of her presentation. The brand‚Äôs rewritten amendments called for the right of women to control their own reproductive lives, receive equal pay, be secure from sexual harassment, and run for political office without being scrutinized over their gender, along with other demands that felt especially timely amidst the #MeToo and Time‚Äôs Up movements. Meanwhile in Paris, Dior staged a full-on 1968 protest down its runway, complete with walls collaged in protest signs and vintage magazine cutouts. But aside from these few moments, most designers opted to keep politics off the runway altogether this season. Perhaps, when the line between cashing in on the resistance and a brand‚Äôs genuine political statements has become murky in today‚Äôs social media-driven world, that‚Äôs a not such a bad thing. Fashion, beauty, and lifestyle companies, which often espouse ‚Äúempowerment‚Äù in new campaigns and email newsletters, quickly realized that feminism could be something for women to buy. But real change does not come in the form of Instagram-friendly T-shirts that donate nothing to a good cause. Similarly, a runway political protest that goes viral may be inspiring, but is the fashion house able to back it up? Does its company pay its female employers equally? Does it offer paid maternity and paternity leave? Does the brand champion diversity and inclusion in hiring, casting, and every day work? And does it genuinely empower those wearing its clothes? Because if not, the brand isn't making any political or feminist statements, it's simply trying to capitalize on a movement. And that is nothing to applaud. Dior's first female artistic director, Maria Grazia Chiuri, is determined to take advantage of her own position in order to have, as she puts it, "a hand in all the challenges we see as fundamental‚Äîfrom equality within the fashion world to equal rights more generally‚Äîand to work together and contribute to the dream of building a fairer world." "Fashion today should take on the responsibility of being activist‚Äù ‚Äî Maria Grazia Chiuri, Dior That might mean staging feminist protests on the runway, as she did for Dior's Fall 2018 collection last month, but it also means backing up this concept internally. Dior recently launched Women @ Dior, an international female mentorship program that pairs 100 female employees with 100 female students from fashion, business, and engineering schools across the world. Through the initiative, the fashion house hopes to empower and mentor the industry‚Äôs future female leaders.  ‚ÄúI believe that fashion today should take on the responsibility of being activist,‚Äù Chiuri added empathically. ‚ÄúAt Dior, we are aware‚Äîthrough everything this name has represented in the history of fashion‚Äîof the central role we can play today as a gauge of the contemporary." Alice + Olivia's Stacey Bendet, whose Fall 2018 presentation also incorporated an array of empowering female elements, echoed Chiuri's sentiment that designers should use their voice for social change. "We are living in a time of turmoil and it is important for women to stand up, speak up, and ensure that our rights our protected. Social media has given designers and brands an incredible voice and I believe in this moment it is imperative that we use our platform to stand up for what we believe in." "Social media has given designers an incredible voice...it is imperative that we use our platform to stand up for what we believe in" ‚Äî Stacey Bendet, Alice + Olivia As demonstrated by Hollywood on the red carpet earlier this year, fashion‚Äôs power to make impactful statements transcends well beyond the runway. From actresses opting for an all-black dress code at the Golden Globes to attendees accessorizing with white roses at the Grammys in support of the Time‚Äôs Up movement, symbolic fashion has the potential to make just as much of an impact. Proving the power of such symbolism‚Äîthat political runway statements don‚Äôt always need picket signs or overt feminist imagery‚Äîwas Jonathan Simkhai. The New York designer, who has utilized T-shirts to advocate for Planned Parenthood in the past, made a subtler statement at his show this season, taking a less literal route by looking to feminist influences of the past, like Gibson Girls and Suffragettes, as major influences for his 2018 collection. ‚ÄúWhile this season‚Äôs messaging was more subtle, equality for women and the upcoming midterms were at the forefront of my mind," explained Simkhai of the inspiration behind his most recent collection. "Many elements of the collection, like the basque jackets and wool glenplaids, were inspired by women who played a major role in shifting the way women and femininity were perceived socially and politically. Remarkably, we are going through a similar change now and it‚Äôs exhilarating to watch the status quo shift in the right direction." "It‚Äôs exhilarating to watch the status quo shift in the right direction" ‚Äî Jonathan Simkhai In his show notes, Simkhai included a quote from congresswoman Maxine Waters: ‚ÄúWe should have hope because we earned it. We worked for it! It‚Äôs ours.‚Äù Though there was no outright feminist imagery, Simkhai made that point through both the collection and the inspiration behind it. And perhaps more importantly, the designer has taken action behind the scenes, most recently by teaming up with Janet Mock for an International Women‚Äôs Day event that prompted guests to call their Congressional representatives to support women‚Äôs issues. So where do designers go from here? Some might argue that fashion‚Äîand the runway in particular‚Äîhas no place in politics. But as Amanda Hallay, head of Fashion History at LIM College and host of The Ultimate Fashion History on Youtube, notes, the industry's political and activist tendencies didn't just start in Donald Trump's America. Fashion has always been a reflector of turbulent political times‚Äîfrom the Zoot Suits of the '40s to London's punk wave in the '70s‚Äîhowever the runway "has historically been slower to respond to politics because, traditionally, runway fashion was the domain of [wealthy] women who often lived lives removed from political tumult."  Of course, in today's world, the runway is no longer reserved solely for the elite class, but instead seen by virtually everyone with access to internet. When you look at times of major political uproar in the past, especially the protests of the 1960s and 1970s, designers didn't really have the opportunity to use runway shows as platforms for social change in an Instagram-free world. Today, for the first time ever, fashion can present more than just next season‚Äôs trends on the runway‚Äîwhich is both an opportunity and an obstacle for many brands. A full-out protest isn't necessary on every runway, but it is becoming increasingly clear that remaining apolitical altogether is no longer an option in the fashion industry. As runways are more visible around the world than ever, why not use that as a way to speak out about‚Äîand more importantly, actually support‚Äîimportant issues? Especially when it comes to topics like women's equality, immigration, and LGBT rights‚Äîall of which directly impact the fashion industry.  Sure, a collection of pretty clothing will always be beautiful to look at, but in the current state of world affairs, brands now have an ability to align themselves with the women who are actually wearing their clothes. As Hallay noted, "I doubt Dior was aware that the New Look of 1947, which spoke to a return to femininity in the post-war era and an embrace of excess fabric after many years of rationing, was quite politic; he was naturally, and quite brilliantly, responding to the zeitgeist. Today, however, it is different. Designers can use a collection to deliberately make a political stance." 
 The 26-year-old Brit model just got her wings. There's another new Angel in town! Today, Victoria's Secret revealed that model Leomie Anderson has officially received her wings. This announcement comes two weeks after the brand announced Barbara Palvin and Alexina Graham had received the coveted openings left behind by Adriana Lima and Alessandra Ambrosio.  The 26-year-old-model is originally from London (south London to be exact), and of Jamaican heritage and has been modeling for nine years. She began her career on the runways, walking in her first designer show for Marc Jacobs.  She went on to book top shows like Moschino, Tommy Hilfiger, Tom Ford, Oscar de la Renta and Ralph Lauren. She's also been featured in major beauty campaigns for Fenty Beauty and Pat McGrath. In 2015 she was casted in the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show on her third attempt at attending the casting calls. It's clear her confidence that she exudes on the runway made a real impact at Victoria's Secret headquarters.  On the model's Instagram announcing the big news she wrote, "Mate I am still in shock... this is something I was even scared to dream about because I never thought it would come true but I am insanely excited to announce that I am Victoria's Secret's newest ANGEL!! I can't even believe it..." But don't label Anderson as just another pretty face.  She's also become known in the industry for being an outspoken voice and she's even developed a platform called LAPP the Brand, to help other girls share their voice. The platform has also spun off into a collection of cool streetwear-inspired pieces from sports bras to track suits.

 The luxury brand creates a Parisian paradise.  Paris added another site of French luxury to its map with the opening of a multi-floor Chanel boutique at the new Galeries Lafayette department store on March 28, 2019. Located on the famed Champs-√âlys√©es, the vast space of Chanel at Galeries Lafayette references the maison‚Äôs Parisian roots, with an elegant main promenade that brings symbols of the city within its walls. The grand store will house Chanel‚Äôs Spring/Summer 2019 ready-to-wear collection, complete with elements evocative of the beach to reference the runway show that took place last October. The focal point of the retail respite is a sculptural, gold Eiffel Tower emerging from sand. Surrounded by mannequins dressed in black, white, and neutral looks from the Spring collection, the display merges urban Parisian life with the dolce vita tones of Chanel‚Äôs seaside paradise.   Adding to the atmosphere, the second floor of the store features six nostalgic pop-ups inspired by the beach theme, featuring displays comprised of sand and Plexiglas that mimics tropical waters. Within these tableaus, mannequins model the seasonal tweed suits, poplin cotton tops, and airy chiffon dresses from the Spring collection, complete with sunglasses, straw hats, and other sun-ready accessories. The installation spaces are also accompanied by two permanent sections dedicated to two of Chanel's celebrated accessories. One for Chanel shoes, housing the iconic two-tone ballerina flats, alongside the sling-backs and sandals from the Spring collection, and another for Chanel watches. The store also includes accessories from other luxury names such as Goossens for jewelry, Maison Michel for millinery, and Barrie for Scottish cashmere pieces. Chanel at Galeries Lafayette Champs-√âlys√©es is open now, with the current pop-up displays on view until April 21.

 She's only been an official Angel for 2 years.  With less than three weeks to go until the Angels take Shanghai, Victoria‚Äôs Secret revealed their highly-coveted fantasy bra today. The ‚ÄúChampagne Nights Fantasy‚Äù bra featuring handset diamonds, yellow sapphires, blue topaz in 18 karat gold, designed by Mouawad, costs $2 million dollars and will be worn by Lais Ribeiro. The 6-foot-1 Brazilian-born stunner who has been working with Victoria‚Äôs Secret since 2010, officially became an Angel in 2015, and has appeared in every fashion show except 2012 when she sprained her ankle during rehearsals and was unable to walk the show. Ribeiro began modeling in 2009, just a year after giving birth to her son Alexandre. Her friends urged her to pursue modeling in her native Brazil and quickly became one of the most booked models during Sao Paulo fashion week. A year later Ribeiro was walking the runways from New York to Paris, working with designers like Jean Paul Gaultier, Marc Jacobs and Tom Ford who made her the face of one of his fragrances.

 FEED cofounder Lauren Bush Lauren models the stylish collection. Ralph Lauren has been synonymous with American fashion since the debut of his namesake ready-to-wear line in 1967. More than 52 years later, the designer's brand is still reigning strong. Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, Blake Lively, and Jessica Chastain are a few notable fans of his classic menswear-inspired pieces. While the designer's legacy is undeniable, he is still finding ways to give back through his love of fashion.  Today, Polo Ralph Lauren, the heritage brand's diffusion line of preppy staples, is teaming up with FEED Projects on a debut capsule collection. The focal point of the four-piece collaboration is two bags and a matching pouch rendered in cr√®me linen and burlap, along with cognac brown leather trim.  Every item in the inaugural collection‚Äîincluding a backpack, pouch, and logo-emblazoned baseball cap‚Äîhighlights the number of meals proceeds from its sale contributes. For example, the tote bag provides 165 school meals to children in America. FEED Projects is a socially conscious business that was cofounded by model-turned designer and entrepreneur Lauren Bush Lauren, who happens to be Ralph Lauren's daughter-in-law. With prices ranging from $65 to $165, the partnership benefits No Kid Hungry, an organization that hopes to eradicate child hunger in the United States by providing nutritional meals to the youth. In support of the campaign, Lauren Bush Lauren was snapped on the streets wearing a cream button-up blouse with her Polo x FEED backpack flung over her shoulder. The entire four-piece offering of Polo x FEED is available in select Ralph Lauren stores and online at RalphLauren.com starting on July 25. 
 "I‚Äôm very much down to earth, just not this earth.‚Äù Karl Lagerfeld was one of a kind in every facet of life. Inimitable, witty, and often outrageous, the designer's legacy spanned well beyond the exquisite collections he created for the world's top fashion houses. With quips like, "sweatpants are a sign of defeat," and "trendy is the last stage before tacky," Lagerfeld became just as known for his outspoken opinions as his designs over the years.  As the fashion world mourns the loss of an icon, we're taking a look back at his most memorable quotes of all time. The genius, the cheeky, and the oh, so Karl. 
 The model is headed back to the runway. Karlie Kloss is breaking her modeling hiatus to return to the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show this year. She announced the news on Instagram yesterday with a sweet backstage shot from the 2014 VS fashion show.  "See you in Shanghai @VictoriasSecret üòáüíó," she wrote in the caption. The 25-year-old made her VS debut in 2011 and officially became an Angel in 2013. In 2015, she put her runway career on hold to attend New York University. Since then, Kloss has dipped her toes outside of the fashion world‚Äîshe started a girls' coding camp, Kode with Klossy, and even landed a cameo in Bill Nye's new science show on Netflix. This fall, however, she'll be returning to her modeling roots.  Kloss is one of the latest models to be confirmed for the 2017 VS fashion show, following Gigi and Bella Hadid. Although her fellow It Girl Kendall Jenner won't be present, Karlie will reunite with plenty of Angels on this year's catwalk in Shanghai.

 Outfit ideas to bundle up in. Despite how deep your love goes for chunky sweaters, oversized scarves, and cozy coats, we all hit a certain point when putting together a cold-weather outfit stops feeling fun and starts becoming a chore. It usually hits around January once the holidays are over, but depending on how finicky the weather gets, it can happen much sooner. But this wintery burnout doesn't have to be permanent. In fact, it's rather simple to remedy‚Äîall you need to do to spark the fire of wardrobe inspiration is thumb through street style pics. There's so much to glean from street style, whether it's inventive ways to wear existing staples, new accessory shapes that could enliven your look, or even a fresh trend you hadn't given much thought to previously. Ahead, digest and shop six of our favorite outfits to get you started.  Add sophistication to your cold-weather look by way of tailored plaid trousers. Complement the slacks with neutral-hued layers and a pair of sleek loafers. Shop the Look: Calvin Klein trench, turtleneck, sweater, and pants. Nomasei loafers. A puffer jacket is the true low-temp wardrobe MVP: it's versatile, ultra-warm, and never goes out of style.

Nike sneakers. 'Tis the season for strategic layering, right? Assemble your tried-and-true staples like an oversized sweater, button-down, and trousers and polish off with a printed neckerchief. If the weather is especially temperamental, toss a big coat on top. Shop the Look: Calvin Klein sweater, shirt, and pants. Dolce & Gabbana scarf. Mounser necklace. Simon Miller bag. While winter is certainly no excuse to forego your beloved colorful pieces, you can still embrace neutral hues if the styling feels unique.

Shop the Look: Calvin Klein cardigan and pants. Frame belt. Usisi bag. Tamara Mellon boots. It's inevitable that when the weather dips below 30 degrees, your wardrobe inspiration can fall a bit flat. When that time comes, consider accessorizing a moody floral midi dress with a scarf, knee-high boots, and a sleek bag. For warmth, add in a trench coat and any other layers you need, like a cardigan or blazer.Shop the Look: Calvin Klein sunglasses, scarf, bag, and dress. Everlane jacket. Dear Frances boots.

 The singer stars in the brand's new ads with her "musical family." Calvin Klein knows how to pluck the right talent out of the music scene to star in its ads. Recent campaigns have featured The xx, Young Thug, and even the ever-elusive Frank Ocean. (And let's not forget Justin Bieber's famous stint with the brand.)  Solange is the newest addition to that roster. The 31-year-old Houston native stars in the American label's latest campaign, creative directed by Raf Simons and shot by Willy Vanderperre. In the shoot, the younger Knowles sister models Calvin Klein's denim and iconic logo underwear.  But Solange doesn't star alone; the Grammy winner brought along her "musical family" to appear in the ads with her. Singers and songwriters Dev Hynes (better known as Blood Orange), Kelela, Caroline Polachek, and Adam Bainbridge of Kindness pose alongside Knowles in a bare barn, decked in blue jeans and white intimates.  "Big love to @calvinklein , raf simons, and the whole calvin team for this moment of celebrating my musical family, and for capturing us so authentically us. #MYCALVINS," she wrote in an Instagram post celebrating the campaign. With this campaign, Calvin Klein also updates its signature #MyCalvins branding, by adding a new facet to the slogan: "Our family." The ads, which are slated to run from the holidays until spring 2018, will feature different groups of people, or "families," who are connected "stylistically, musically, and culturally," the brand said in a statement.   Solange's close circle is just the first of many to be highlighted, featuring the slogan "Our Music" on each image. We can only imagine what a Calvin campaign starring her biological family‚Äîincluding Beyonc√©, their mother Tina Lawson, and all‚Äîwould look like.  
 For working out or lounging around in.  Whether your New Years resolution was to workout more or relax on your couch more, a good pair of leggings makes all the difference. At a time when there's more and more chic activewear brands worth discovering every day, finding the perfect pair of leggings can be a daunting task. To save you some effort (and coins), we rounded up our favorites that are good for working out, traveling, lounging or those days when you simply just don't want to wear pants. These are the BAZAAR.com editor tested and approved winners.  "I own like four pairs of plain black because I can‚Äôt quit them. They‚Äôre the perfect thickness and suck you in. And the high waist is super flattering. Bonus they‚Äôre pretty long and fit tall girls like myself. Also affordable!"‚ÄîKathryn Rice,¬†Video Producer "These are my favorite¬†leggings, because the fit is perfect (I only do high-waisted pants) and the material is so soft, but they always maintain their shape."‚ÄîChrissy Rutherford,¬†Senior Digital Fashion Editor "While I love dressing up and am rarely out of heels, my job requires tons of red-eye and long-haul trips‚Äìand when I‚Äôm waking up early to head to the airport or planning to spend the night in-flight, I turn to my athleisure and workout wear. I love these high-waisted leggings because they don‚Äôt stretch out over time, are thick (and almost compressive), and they make for a cute look when styled right."‚ÄîCarrie Goldberg, Weddings & Travel Editor "Like all other pants in my life, I love a high waisted workout legging and Live the Process makes the coolest ones."‚ÄîKerry Pieri,¬†Digital Fashion/Features Director "I own two pairs of Sweaty Betty leggings and love, love, love to wear them. I am (sort of) a runner, so I really appreciate leggings that have a good pocket for my phone. Having easy access to my music can be the difference between a good and bad workout for me, so I cherish the side-pocket leggings when running outdoors." ‚ÄîPerri Tomkiewicz, Senior Designer¬† "I absolutely swear by my Adidas¬†leggings. I‚Äôll wear them when I‚Äôm lounging at home, when I‚Äôm traveling, when I‚Äôm going on casual coffee runs; I will probably wear them to the grave. Oh, and if you want to wear them to work out I guess they‚Äôre good for that too."¬†‚ÄîErica Gonzales,¬†Assistant Digital Editor "I live in Aritzia‚Äôs high-waisted Atmosphere¬†leggings¬†on the weekends. They don‚Äôt get stretched out and ride down during a workout, and look just as cute paired with an oversized sweater or t-shirt for errands after."‚ÄîJulie Kosin, Director of Audience Strategy and Entertainment¬†¬† "Girlfriend Collective has the best matching sports bra and legging sets‚Äîthe high-waisted cut is flattering and compressive without feeling like it's cutting off your circulation. And even better, the inclusively-sized brand makes all of its activewear from recycled plastic bottles so you can feel good about your purchase." ‚ÄîLauren Fisher, Market Editor¬† ‚ÄúDid you know your favorite tights brand has a serious handle on chic¬†leggings? I love Wolford‚Äôs faux suede ones for a comfortable, but clearly-not-your-gym-pants look.‚Äù‚ÄîJoyann¬†King, Executive Director. "These are literally the best leggings in the world. Perfect for working out; perfect for a lazy day around the house. They hold you in in all the right places and not only look incredible, they feel incredible."‚ÄîLauren McCall, Associate Creative Producer ¬†"These Topshop leggings are ideal for when you want to dress comfortably, but not look like you're headed to the gym. The material is a perfect combination of thick and stretchy, and I love the sheer panel detail of the high-waisted band. Dress them down with a t-shirt on the weekend, or rock them at work with heels and a blazer."¬†‚ÄîLauren Sheffield, Social Media Editor
 "IG Shopping" could make it easier to scroll and shop. If you're a late night Instagram scroller and have made purchases based on photos you saw in your feed, we have great news for you. According to sources at The Verge, Instagram will soon be debuting "IG Shopping," a standalone app dedicated solely to browsing and shopping all in one place.  Although Instagram declined to comment on the reports, sources say that the social media company believes it can greatly expand into e-commerce. It's currently unknown when the app, which is reportedly still in development, could launch, according to The Verge. It's also possible it could be cancelled before it releases.   Since launching in 2010, Instagram has over 1 billion users, and according to Instagram, over 15 million of those users are registered as businesses. Those accounts will likely benefit most from these shopping upgrades. In 2016, Instagram debuted their first shoppable "tags," which "bring important product information to the consumer earlier in the journey, all without having to leave the Instagram app to search," said Instagram Business. Instagram recently debuted another new feature, IGTV, June, in an effort to overtake the video content usually uploaded on YouTube. IGTV does have its own standalone app, but its videos are also available to view in-app on Instagram. "It‚Äôs built for how you actually use your phone, so videos are full screen and vertical. Also, unlike on Instagram, videos aren‚Äôt limited to one minute. Instead, each video can be up to an hour long," said co-founder and CEO Kevin Systrom upon the release of IGTV. "Instagram has always been a place to connect with the people who inspire, educate and entertain you every day," he added. "With your help, IGTV begins a new chapter of video on Instagram. We hope it brings you closer to the people and things you love." 
 The brand will ban all use of fur, effective in 2018. Michael Kors is the latest to join a growing list of luxury brands opting to go fur-free. The American fashion house announced today that it will no longer use animal fur in any of its products.  According to Business of Fashion, Kors's no fur policy will become effective in 2018, with production being fully phased out by December 2018. The policy will be companywide, meaning it will also include Jimmy Choo‚Äîwhich Kors acquired in July for $1.2 billion.   "Due to technological advances in fabrications, we now have the ability to create a luxe aesthetic using non-animal fur. We will showcase these new techniques in our upcoming runway show in February," Michael Kors said in a statement. More and more luxury brands are now opting to go fur-free, due to pressure from animal activists as well as textile innovations allowing for the creation of luxe faux fur fabrics. In October, Gucci also announced its joining of the Fur Free Alliance‚Äîa huge move for the luxury Italian brand. Both the Italian brand and Michael Kors join an expanding list of designers that have banned the use of animal fur including Stella McCartney (who has been creating sustainable faux fur and leather designs for years), Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein, Armani, Tommy Hilfiger and online retailer Net-A-Porter.  While major fashion houses like Michael Kors committing to go fur-free fashion is a huge leap for the industry, there's still a large number of brands fully embracing real fur. As BoF reports, Fur Information Council of America spokesperson Keith Kaplan revealed "nearly 70 percent of major designers included fur in their Autumn/Winter 2017 collections." Meaning there's still plenty of room for more designers to get onboard the faux fur train. 
 The result was a spring collection that championed the power of both femininity and feminism.  For Spring 2018, Alice + Olivia's Stacey Bendet created not only a collection, but an entire space made for women, by women. Inspired by New York's iconic Chelsea Hotel, where she conducted one of her first-ever photo-shoots, Bendet tapped seven female artists and one vocalist to design rooms in a reimagined modern-day version of the hotel. "I really wanted to collaborate with all different female artists and make this a moment where I could showcase their work too," Bendet told BAZAAR.com at the presentation today. "I had each of them design a different room that I then tied the clothing in the collection back to. It was pure passion‚Äîthese are all artists that I love and I‚Äôve known from different walks of life." Artists Francesca DiMattio, Tallulah Willis, Lola Schnabel, Angelica Hicks, Lucy Sparrow, Blair Z, Jemima Kirke, and Susie Lopez, as well as singer Scout Willis all created their own rooms. For some of her pieces, Bendet reimagined Francesca DiMattio's paintings as mixed prints, designed a set of bright, '80s-infused looks based on a neon sign hanging in Tallulah Willis's room, and created kitschy Twinkies and Hostess cupcakes clutches inspired by Lucy Sparrow's "fauxdega" kitchen.   Bendet's own feminist artwork was featured in black and white hallways, where models in symbolic all-white looks were stationed. "For this season, one of my trends was this high-low of girls feeling really romantic, feminine, and free-spirited but also tough," the designer revealed.   Though each woman had a different take on her Chelsea Hotel room, together they all embodied a similar spirit of proud femininity. "They had to be female artists with a real feminine spirt to their artwork. It all came together because I picked people I loved and knew," Bendet said. The end result? A presentation and spring collection that made a feminist statement on a level that delved much deeper than statement t-shirts.  See all of the artists' rooms featured in Alice + Olivia's Spring 2018 presentation below: 
 After 17 years with the iconic British brand. Christopher Bailey, Burberry's creative director, will exit at the end of 2018 after 17 years with the brand. He'll remain president and chief creative officer until he steps down from the board on March 31, 2018, and will guide CEO Marco Gobbetti through the transition until he fully parts ways with the label on December 31, 2018. ‚ÄúIt has been the great privilege of my working life to be at Burberry, working alongside and learning from such an extraordinary group of people over the last 17 years," Bailey said in a statement. "It has been a truly inspiring place to work and the decision to leave was not an easy one." The designer, 46, joined Burberry in 2001 under former CEO Rose Marie Bravo and has been a part of the brand's "incredible transformation" and "success in that period," Gobbetti said in a statement. After Bravo stepped down, Bailey worked closely with her successor, Angela Ahrendts, when she started in 2006 an helped establish the British label as a reputable luxury brand, Business of Fashion reports. He took over as chief creative officer and chief executive officer in 2014, when Ahrendts left for Apple. Gobbetti, who joined Burberry as CEO this year, respects Bailey's decision to leave and is now working to find his successor. "While I am sad not to have the opportunity to partner with him for longer, the legacy he leaves and the exceptional talent we have at Burberry give me enormous confidence in our future," he added.  Bailey continues in his statement: "I do truly believe, however, that Burberry‚Äôs best days are still ahead of her and that the company will go from strength to strength with the strategy we have developed and the exceptional talent we have in place led by Marco. I would like to thank all my colleagues as well as Sir John Peace and the Board for all their support and faith in me over the years. I am excited to pursue new creative projects but remain fully committed to the future success of this magnificent brand and to ensuring a smooth transition."
 Are these the shoes of summer '18? While Christopher Kane was the first luxury designer to collaborate with Crocs in 2016‚ÄîBalenciaga is taking the ubiquitous gardening shoe to new heights for spring/summer 2018.  Yesterday in Paris, Demna Gvasalia debuted his latest collection for the house of Balenciaga. The show had a little something for everyone: plaid, stripes, leopard, denim, utilitarian jackets, spiked pumps, over-the-boots with screen-printed sunsets, and, yes, platform Croc sandals.  What makes the Balenciaga version such a standout though is not only the 4-inch foam platform, but that the shoe will also be branded with Demna's newly redesigned Balenciaga logo.  The time is now to get on the waist list. 
 The actress joins the #AerieREAL Role Model campaign. Busy Philipps has always kept it real. From her late-night show to her social media feeds and revealing memoir, the actress isn‚Äôt afraid to tell it‚Äîand show it‚Äîlike it is. So she makes a natural choice for Aerie's latest, un-retouched ‚ÄúReal Role Model‚Äù campaign, which showcases a group of unapologetically authentic women. The actress and late night host joins previous #AerieREAL campaign stars Iskra Lawrence, Aly Raisman and Cleo Wade, along with actresses Jameela Jamil and Samira Wiley, gold medal Paralympian snowboarder Brenna Huckaby, and motivational speaker Molly Burke in the Spring 2019 ads. "The more women that they [kept] naming, I was like, 'This is the greatest! Of course I want to be involved with this group of girls,'" Philipps told BAZAAR.com over the phone.     Since going Photoshop-free in 2014, Aerie has committed to celebrating body positivity and diversity in all its ads and imagery. And like the rest of the new campaign's stars, Philipps is no stranger to speaking out on body image, unrealistic beauty standards, and Hollywood's complicity.  To celebrate the new campaign, the Busy Tonight host spoke with BAZAAR.com to discuss the effects of Facetune and how she's raising her daughters to be body positive.  I was so excited when Aerie asked me to be a part of it. I knew what the campaign was already, and I knew Aly [Raisman] was rejoining it. I'm so inspired by her. But then I heard Samira Wiley, who I'm obsessed with and had just met not that long ago, and Jameela [Jamil], who I also know and love what she does, were joining too. And the more women that they [kept] naming, I was like, this is the greatest! Of course I want to be involved with this group of girls.  It was really incredible. Cleo Wade and I had never met in person, but we have a lot of mutual friends and I've always been a huge fan of her as an author. I have her book Heart Talk, and find her to be incredibly inspiring in the work and activism she does. It was awesome to meet her on set, and I actually had a weird work situation that day, and she gave me advice and talked me through it. It was a really valuable day on set, which sometimes you don't get those. It felt very empowering, and like we were all there to support one another.  I just call it out for what it is, it's bullsh*t. The more campaigns we have like Aerie‚Äôs Real Role Model campaigns, where they‚Äôre showing various shapes, sizes, and types of women that aren‚Äôt airbrushed or Photoshopped, the more those images can become mainstream and change people's brains. These are what real women look like. We have this default setting [of beauty] that's based off years and years of visual programming of seeing the exact same perfected bodies and faces. We all know that‚Äôs not what humans look like in real life.  For my social media presence, I did make a choice to not use apps that would change my body or face or take away a zit or whatever. When I first joined Instagram and I had some friends that really used all of those apps, I was like, "Why? What's the point?" I want people to get used to seeing what I actually look like. I don't want them to think that I look like this perfect alien. I'm not. I'm a regular person.  "If we can move away from using women's appearances and bodies as descriptors for their person, that can be helpful for the young women in my daughters' generation."  I really try to lead by example. That is something that as mothers, and just as women in general, we all need to do. I think a lot about the words I use to talk about my own body in my home, in front of my girls, and how I speak about other women. I've curbed commenting on other women's appearances since I became a mother 10 years ago. It was something I did before that made sense to me to stop doing. We have to reset the norm, and if we can move away from women's appearances and bodies as being descriptors for their person, that can be helpful for the young women in my daughter's generation.  It's all happening.(AGAIN!) üòçüòçüòç@disneycruiseline #showusyourears #disneycruiseline A post shared by  Busy Philipps (@busyphilipps) on Nov 19, 2018 at 9:54am PST I try to be aware of the media and things they're consuming when I'm not around, but of course you can't have it all on lock. No one can and parents may think they can, but they're just delusional. So we try to have a really open dialogue about things. As my older daughter gets a little bit older, I try to listen as much as possible and pay attention. I talk with her and her friends and I listen to the things that they're finding valuable, and I see if there needs to be any sort of redirection.We've had conversations with my older daughter and her friends about the Internet, and not just safety but also the truth of the Internet, FOMO, and the fact that people use apps to change their faces sometimes on Instagram. The teen stars they look up to might be using those apps, and what does that mean? And what is the person's value? Does it matter that someone has 2 million followers on Instagram or 25,000 likes? We try to really impress upon them to make their own decisions and to be critical thinkers, but there are different things to be critically thinking about now as a 10-year-old, then say when I was a 10-year-old.  Yeah and they know all about that. Birdie's [Philipps' oldest daughter] best friend is an expert at it. She can take a photo of me and Facetune me into a Kardashian. My daughter understands that's not real, that there's real value in being natural and truthful to your own self because your worst goes beyond what you look like, or the shape of your body.    Oh man, it's been such a journey. I would tell the much younger me to really lean into the uniqueness of myself, because ultimately that's what has brought me the most success in both my career and my life. I think in your late teens, and especially early twenties (when I was starting out in this industry), I looked for a lot of ways to make myself less-than to fit into molds that were not for me. The more I let go of what I perceived as others' expectations of me, the more I was able to come into my own, and be this 39-year-old f*cking bad-ass I am now. 
 The designer and actress had a decades-long bond that shaped both of their careers.  This morning, it was announced that Hubert de Givenchy passed away in Paris at the age of 91. The iconic designer, who founded the house of Givenchy in 1952, was known for his elegant, sophisticated creations that influenced fashion for over five decades. But it was his relationship with Audrey Hepburn that took his legacy to the next level‚Äîand hers too. The designer and actress forged a special bond that lasted the duration of both their careers, shaping their works in Hollywood and the fashion industry. Hepburn, who served as Givenchy's greatest muse from the '50s until her death in 1993, wore the label in some of her most famous roles including Breakfast at Tiffany's, Sabrina and Funny Face. As we remember the late designer, take a look back at his special relationship with the Hollywood icon.  Hepburn trying on one of Givenchy's designs in an undated photo.

 We'll take that little bustier and those snakeskin pants... GRLFRND is often the answer when you ask any fashion girl you know, "what are those jeans? They're really good." Revolve's in-house denim brand nails fit and on-trend styles‚Äîgetting that mix of limited stretch, just the right distressing, and interesting length options just right. "Our customer comes back to us time and time again because we've become her go-to denim brand," Raissa Gerona, Revolve's chief brand officer ,says of the denim brand that can call everyone from Bella Hadid to Jennifer Aniston fans. Now GRLFRND is expanding into the ready-to-wear category with an emphasis on basics with that something special, and it's selling beyond Revolve with a range that recently went live on FWRD.com, priced between $78 - $998. Gerona explains the thought process behind the expansion as a straight-forward decision, "We want to make sure we accommodate our customer by providing her with pieces that she can pair back with her favorite GRLFRND jeans and beyond, including suiting and dressier options she can wear when she wants to get a little more dressed up." Standouts from the collection include a minimal-meets-western tan jumpsuit, a white shirt dress, leather biker shorts, snakeskin print pants, and a range of cozy but cool knits. The inspiration was all the ladies already in your Insta "saved" folder. "We were influenced by iconic women like Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, Princess Diana, Monica Belluci, Sade, our fellow friends and GRLFRNDs, and a general juxtaposition of vintage and modernity," Gerona says. We'll take that leather trench, add a Bessette-Kennedy-esque headband and be on our way, thanks.
 Orthopedic shoes but make it fashion.  Christopher Kane is no stranger to the ugly shoe trend. In fact, it was his several collaborations with Crocs that helped usher the movement along in past seasons.  But now, the British designer is venturing into new ugly shoe territory: bedazzled orthopedic shoes. At his Fall 2018 show during London Fashion Week, Kane unveiled his latest bout of ugly shoes: black chunky sneakers set on spiral boosters. The shoes, of course, are also bejeweled with colorful crystal embellishments.  If the sneakers look vaguely similar to your grandparents' orthopedic shoes, it's no coincidence. For the collection, Kane collaborated with an actual orthopedic footwear brand, Z-Coil, on the comfort shoes.  While it's unclear if this is a footwear trend that will actually take, I can assure you my grandma (and plenty of other older women at that) will at least be pleased about someone trying to make orthopedic shoes chic.  Of course, this is hardly Kane's introduction into the world of questionable shoe trends. Last season, the designer brought crystalized high-top Crocs to the runway at London Fashion Week. For Fall 2017, he tried fur-lined Crocs and the season before that, geode-encrusted Crocs.  The trend then spread, with Balenciaga delivering its own take on Crocs with a sky-high platform version last season as part of its Spring 2018 collection.     From Crocs to actual orthopedic shoes, it's unclear how many people are really embracing this level of the ugly shoe trend (outside of the street style scene). But for Christopher Kane, it seems to be an aesthetic that's working. 
 Even Brooklyn's new girlfriend was in attendance. Victoria Beckham returned to London Fashion Week this weekend to debut her brand's Autumn/Winter '19 collection at Tate Britain. Set in the iconic London gallery, Beckham's show attracted celebs including Olivia Palermo. And the entire Beckham clan could be seen cheering the designer on from the front row.  Per The Guardian, Beckham described who her new collection was for saying, "She‚Äôs a lady, but she‚Äôs not particularly ladylike. Or maybe she‚Äôs ladylike but not really a lady‚Äîwhichever way you want to look at it, she‚Äôs got a bit of a naughty side." As usual, the Beckhams looked extremely proud of Victoria's work. It's worth noting that daughter Harper Beckham was totally rocking a bob hairstyle with blunt bangs for the event:    Brooklyn Beckham was accompanied by his model girlfriend, Hana Cross, to the fashion show, who is starting to look like one of the family already: The designer also streamed the fashion show live on her YouTube channel, in case you wanted to watch it in its entirety: The designer recently revealed that she will be launching Victoria Beckham Beauty this fall, which is more than a little exciting.

 Meet the under-the-radar Philly showroom behind the new It scrunchie. From barrettes to bejeweled bobby pins, headbands, and scrunchies, nostalgic hair accessories have been having a moment. But if you thought the current scrunchie revival may be slowing down, think again. The trend is only getting bigger, better, and more extra, thanks to the crop of organza, cloudlike  scrunchies taking over Instagram.  The new wave of hair accessories doesn't helm from one of fashion's buzzy It brands but from an under-the-radar showroom called Room Shop Vintage in Philadelphia. The newly opened space boasts a cool curation of vintage pieces, along with its own collection of sustainable, supersized scrunchies made from deadstock and recycled or discontinued fabrics.

A post shared by  Room Shop (@roomshopvintage) on Jun 2, 2019 at 7:54am PDT Offered in a range of colors from pink to tie-dye to this season's new lime green trend, the poufed organza designs are nothing like the scrunchies of the '80s and '90s. Ideal for those who bask in the art of being extra, the over-the-top scrunchies are (unsurprisingly) already flooding social media feeds.     Had a very long conversation with this brick wall just so I could show off my scrunchie.

A post shared by  Room Shop (@roomshopvintage) on Jun 18, 2019 at 1:36pm PDT  The scrunchie creations come from the husband-and-wife duo behind Room Shop Vintage, Shelly Horst and Dryw Scully. After quitting their jobs in retail, the couple began selling vintage finds from their road trips across the country. Their pieces were so in demand, they opened a store/showroom in South Philly's Bok building. The dreamy space is now home to the scrunchies, along with the store's selection of vintage apparel, bags, and accessories.     Room Shop's cloud scrunchies come in two sizes: the large, regular size, which retails for $20; and the mini cloud (for those who want to be a little less extra), which retails for $12. Philly might be best known for its history, cheesesteaks, and die-hard sports fans, but it may be time to add giant cloud scrunchies to the list too. For those not located in the area, the scrunchies are also available to shop online at roomshopvintage.com.  ü•¨üíöüêâüçêüçàü•íüëí#gogreen A post shared by  Kat Hsu ü¶ã ‰∫≠‰∫≠ (@iamtheflowerthief) on Jul 2, 2019 at 10:06am PDT

 He replaces Christopher Bailey, who stepped down in October. In a surprising move, Burberry has named Riccardo Tisci as its new Chief Creative Officer. The former Givenchy designer replaces Christopher Bailey, who stepped down from the position in October after 17 years with the British brand.  Tisci will present his first collection for the brand in September, WWD reports. The designer announced the news on his Instagram early this morning.  "I am honoured and delighted to be joining Burberry as its new Chief Creative Officer and reuniting with Marco Gobbetti. I have an enormous respect for Burberry‚Äôs British heritage ad global appeal and I am excited about the potential of this exceptional brand," he wrote.  "I want to thank #Burberry for this incredible opportunity - I am so excited to join the team and for everything we will achieve together," he added. This marks Tisci's first major design gig since being Givenchy's creative director, a position he held for over a decade before leaving in February 2017. In his new role at Burberry, he'll reunite with the French fashion house's former exec, Marco Gobbetti, who is now the CEO of Burberry. "Riccardo is one of the most talented designers of our time," Gobbetti said in a statement. The news also debunks widespread rumors that Tisci was joining Versace. Though there was widespread speculation for over a year, negotiations reportedly broke down in June. Bailey debuted his final Burberry show on February 17 for the label's Spring 2018 collection. Both the clothes and the presentation included rainbow motifs as the designer's tribute to LGBTQ youth.  We look forward to seeing a new era of Burberry under Tisci's helm.

 The real Fashion Week lives on Britney's Instagram.  As New York Fashion Week unfolds, there are plenty of street style trends emerging: animal print, cowboy boots, white boots, prairie dresses, and so on. But if you're not attending the shows, that doesn't mean you can't get in on all the fashion action from home. Just take note from iconic fashion influencer Britney Jean Spears who's currently phoning in this season's top street style trends from her pool.  Giving us her own #NYFW, Brit posted a photo of herself wearing two of fall's hottest trends‚Äîwhite slouch knee-high boots and animal print (in the form of a zebra bikini, no less)‚Äîby her pool on Instagram. Because she couldn't decide to wear her hair up or down, she selflessly gave us both options to choose from.   Come to think of it, the one thing missing from New York Fashion Week is, in fact, the Oscar-snubbed Crossroads actress herself. I mean, this is the woman who first accessorized with a giant python. The woman who pioneered a movement of crop tops and belly button rings. The woman who made us all want to carry a Starbucks Frappucino and Cheetos instead of a handbag. Fashion Week needs her.  Just imagine the street style photo potential: Sure, she could sit front row, but given her many runway show videos on Instagram, we know she'd be a natural star on the catwalk.  I could keep going all the way until Exhibit Z, but you get the point. Consider this the first official petition to get Britney Jean Spears to New York Fashion Week.  In the meantime, shop Britney's white boot look below. 
 The force has never looked so good. Who knew Christian Louboutin was a Star Wars fan? To celebrate the release of The Last Jedi, the latest installment in the beloved sci-fi franchise, the famed shoemaker teamed up with Disney and Lucasfilm for a range of heels inspired by four of the movie's leading ladies: Rey, Admiral Holdo, Captain Phasma, and Rose Tico.  The footwear is up for auction from now until December 20, and a portion of the proceeds will benefit Starlight Children's Foundation, which supports critically ill children in hospitals, on behalf of Star Wars: Force for Change. Although one pair of limited-edition Louboutins‚Äîsigned by the designer and a Star Wars actress‚Äîseems like a big enough prize alone, there's even more included in the package. Winners get a second pair of the shoes plus a chance to visit the Lucasfilm headquarters, tour the studio, and view a special screening of The Last Jedi in San Francisco on January 16. (Unfortunately, travel and accommodations are not included.) The bids currently range from $2,000 to $3,250, but the packages have an estimated value of $10,000 each.  There's also an additional "showpiece" that will be added to the auction on December 9, after it's unveiled at the movie premiere. According to the brand, this shoe is inspired by the film and Louboutin's extreme Ballerina Ultima heel.  Take a closer look at the limited-edition shoes below. Star Wars: The Last Jedi opens in theaters on December 15.   This shoe, fashioned after Rey (Daisy Ridley), features a leather wrap ankle strap inspired by the belt on her costume. The translucent straps are a nod to "her Jedi powers and the Force she embodies," the brand said in a statement. The tiny blue brass hue on the heel is a tribute to her lightsaber.  BID This plum pump is an homage to Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo (Laura Dern), who sports lavender hair in the film. The drapery on the shoe mimics the fabric of her costume. BID This silver style was inspired by Captain Phasma (Gwendoline Christie), if the sleek lines and metallic color scheme didn't already give it away. The criss-crossing straps imitate the curves of her armor. BID Even Star Wars newbie Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran) gets featured in the collection. As a maintenance worker in the Resistance, her design includes utilitarian details, as told by the block heel surrounding an inner stiletto, and a sandy ribbon ankle strap reminiscent of the color of her uniform.  BID A mini BB-9E and BB-8 roll among Louboutin samples and sketches in Louboutin's design studio.  Loubtouin works his genius. Watch: Christian Louboutin Is Releasing a Line of Baby Shoes

 As one does.  Last night, Karl Lagerfeld was honored at an intimate dinner hosted by V Magazine in New York. To f√™te the occasion, the designer was serenaded with a special performance by none other than Mariah Carey (which is quite truthfully the only way anyone should ever be honored in life). How does one pay tribute to the legendary fashion designer behind Chanel, Fendi, and his own namesake brand? With a performance of the 2008 classic "Touch My Body," of course. The Elusive Chanteuse herself serenaded Lagerfeld with three fitting song choices: "Touch My Body," "Hero," and "We Belong Together." Karl basked in all the glory from a close-up front row seat:  That iconic white ponytail and that iconic bedazzled belly chain‚Äîit's the mashup we never knew we needed.

 The most important question has to be: do they chafe?  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. As we approach the summer, everyone is scrambling to find the perfect look for festival season. And Parisian fashion label Y/Project has just launched a polarizing piece of clothing that is probably going to be a big talking point in 2019. We are, of course, talking about   Y/Project's "denim panties," and yes, they are every bit as confusing as they sound. Carrying a $315 price tag (on the ssense website), Y/Project's "navy denim panties" have pretty much set the internet on fire, as People reports. Described as "denim brief-style shorts," it's easy to imagine the unforgettable item becoming a surprise Coachella hit, for anyone looking to show some serious skin:   Two words: Denim panties.

 The 'RuPaul's Drag Race' winner talks the importance of her new pinup-inspired ad campaign.  In a year when gender norms are (finally) being challenged more than ever, Violet Chachki just made a huge stride by becoming the first drag queen to land a major lingerie campaign.  Chachki, who won the seventh season of RuPaul's Drag Race, faces a Bettie Page-inspired lingerie campaign for London brand, Playful Promises. In the series of photos, she models a range of vintage, pin-up-esque pieces from bustier bras to high-waisted underwear, corsets, and garter belts.     Channeling Bettie Page for the barrier-breaking campaign was especially fitting for Chachki, as the '50s pin-up model is a big part of her drag persona, "Bettie Page has been a big inspiration for my drag character for a long time, so it‚Äôs kind of full circle for me. I reference her a lot in my work so it was kind of the perfect pairing for me and a dream job," Chachki told BAZAAR.com. But along with the dream role as Page, what's even more monumental is being able to represent drag queens in a space that has been reserved exclusively for cis women. "It‚Äôs so gratifying to be accepted into a world that I never thought a drag queen would be accepted into," Chachki said of breaking into the lingerie industry.  The mainstream fashion industry still has a lot of work to do in continuing to challenge gender norms, but Chachki is hopeful that progress will continue to be made. As for what she thinks the industry needs to do in order to be better: "More visibility and variety. There‚Äôs so many different identities out there and I think they all deserve some visibility. Showing variety in representation in casting is super important, it gives minorities a platform and I think it definitely creates a safe space for conversation and progress.‚Äù "It‚Äôs about taking risks. I mean, casting gender non-conforming people in campaigns and editorials and on covers of magazines is a risk for any business because there‚Äôs going to be controversy, but I think they need to take the risk and believe they‚Äôre moving in the right direction," Chacki added, calling out brands' and magazines' roles in promoting inclusivity and diversity.  The Bettie Page lingerie collection modeled by Chachki is available to shop now at playfulpromises.com.

 A lesson in timeless dressing. We've come to regard the trench coat as one of our favorite wardrobe staples.  While designers have turned out countless iterations‚ÄîHensely brings a soft ease to the ubiquitous piece as one of their core offerings. Inspired by her roots in India, classic Indian dancing and her mother, founder Neha Kapur Nayyar sought out to create a line for women who want to reinvent themselves without having to change their inherent style. The product is a feminine and timeless collection of dresses, knits, suiting and outwear. Nayyar heavily focuses on the details and movement of her pieces. Below, we tapped the LA-based designer to show us the best ways to style her favorite piece from her collection. Why is this your wardrobe MVP? The Hensely Trench is a core staple of the brand, a season-less silhouette and a piece which is so versatile that it can be also worn as a dress or coat. I particularly love that it has an element of classic sensibility exhibited with a modern understanding.  Look 1 worn with Prada shoes.  The versatility of this trench is limitless. Wearing it as a dress shows how it can also be styled as a delicate evening attire look. Look 2 worn with Victoria's Secret Slip, Hensely Wide Leg Pants  "I always need formal options for business meetings and wearing the trench as a power suit is my go-to option as it feels very empowering. The wide leg pants give it a hint of formality and can be worn easily from day to evening." Look 3 worn with Rag and Bone tank, Mother jeans, Common Projects shoes  Adding a pair of jeans and a tank top really shows the ease and flow of the trench , it's casual but still classic. This is what I love to wear while taking long walks with my dog.
 But there's still plenty of room for improvement. The Fashion Spot's seasonal rundown of runway diversity in fashion ad campaigns for autumn/winter came with some hopeful news ‚Äî but also showed us there's still a long way to go before everyone can feel truly represented. Let's start with the good news. Fall ad campaigns were markedly more diverse than previous seasons and, for the first time ever, the number of nonwhite models cast exceeded 30 percent. Saint Laurent, Coach 1941, Christian Dior, Dolce & Gabbana, Gap, Helmut Lang and Nordstrom were among the most racially diverse campaigns. Those who did less well? The likes of Balmain, Sies Marjan, Simone Rocha and Vivienne Westwood cast just one model of color in campaigns featuring six or more women.  And of the seven models who booked the most campaigns, only one was nonwhite: Adwoa Aboah.  To arrive at these figures, the Fashion Spot reviewed 187 Fall 2017 fashion print ads comprising of 457 model castings. As they write, "in a refreshing change of pace ‚Äî the most recent ad season was more racially diverse than its runway counterpart." "The takeaway? In terms of racial representation, change is happening." Models over age 50 saw increased visibility this season: 14 women appeared in Fall campaigns this year. This is a sevenfold increase over Spring 2017.   In the world of plus-size, however, the industry didn't fair so well. While a record 26 plus-size models walked the runways of New York ‚Äî something of a watershed moment ‚Äî in print, plus-size women accounted for just 10 of the 457 castings. That's just 2.2 percent and actually a 0.1 point dip from the Spring 2017 campaign season.  And transgender models still face problems. They were the least represented group this season, accounting for only 6 of the 457 castings, or a mere 1.3 percent.  Spring 2017 saw five castings, so this year we've managed to beat the record by just one person.  Surprisingly, model, actress and activist Hari Nef ‚Äî one of the fashion world's most prominent transgender voices ‚Äî landed the lowest-profile gig of the group, appearing in Swedish shoe and accessories brand Vagabond's Fall 2017 ads.  That said, the model did recently land her second major beauty campaign, co-starring in the campaign for Gucci Bloom. As Fashion Spot writes: "While these steps may seem plodding ‚Äî to an almost defeating degree, especially given the current administration's recent incursions on transgender rights ‚Äî they can't be underestimated. If three's a trend, four seasons of incremental, but nonetheless visible, improvement could be considered a shift."

 Your sartorial guide to the year ahead.  As we get ready to usher in a new year, it's also time to usher in a new set of trends. According to the runways, the street style scene, and the best dressed A-listers, these are the emerging fashion trends to watch in 2018. Whether your resolution is to take more style risks or hone in on your wardrobe, these are the looks to weave into your wardrobe. Plus, the trends it's time to retire (for now).   Pantone may have declared "Ultra Violet" the official color of 2018, but we're banking on the pretty pastel shade of lavender to takeover instead. From pantsuits to romantic dresses, the pale hue was all over the Spring 2018 runways‚Äîand makes for an Instagram-friendly alternative to millennial pink.  From left: Michael Kors, Max Mara, Erdem Spring 2018 runways Art and fashion intersected on the Spring 2018 runways, making for a colorful and rich way to shake up any wardrobe. From the bold Warhol-inspired pieces at Versace to cartoon works of art emblazoned onto Prada's collection, art is wearable in 2018.  Pictured: Versace Spring 2018 and a street style look at Milan Fashion Week Gray checked blazers took over the street style scene and our Instagram feeds this past season, but the trend is just getting started. Flourishing into full-on plaid, the print was everywhere from the runways to the street style set outside the shows. From colorful coats to menswear-inspired blazers to unexpected plaid accessories, there are endless ways to weave the trend into your wardrobe this year.  The classic trench coat gets a fresh upgrade after being reworked in an endless amount of iterations on the runways. From new cuts to feathers and ruffles, there's a fun new trench for everyone to try this season. Pictured: C√©line Spring 2018 Making for one of the most fun trends of the season, fringe is back and more over-the-top than ever. Ultra-glam, dramatic fringe was spotted on the runways at Calvin Klein, Dior, Loewe, and more. For those looking to try the trend, it's already surfacing on bags, skirts, and playful trimmed tops for a more subtle way to embrace the look.  One of the most taboo accessory trends of all time is making its comeback‚Äîand it's officially cooler than ever. Earlier in 2017, the bag trend was spotted on Kendall Jenner, A$AP Rocky, Rihanna, and Bella Hadid. For Spring 2018, it was all over the runways, proving the revamp is here to stay.  Before you crack a "groundbreaking florals" joke, spring's iteration of the print comes in the form of retro, '60s-inspired styles that actually do feel fresh. Once reserved for your grandmother's tablecloth or couch, '60s flower prints make for a playful dress or two-piece set this season.  From left: Marc Jacobs, Balenciaga, Kenzo Tapping into '80s and '90s workout gear, the new wave of athleisure is going full-on throwback. Retro workout pieces weren't just spotted on Rihanna's Fenty x Puma Spring collection, but also at fashion houses like Gucci, Tod's, and Louis Vuitton, bringing the ultimate mashup of high fashion and the gym. For 2018, incorporate the pieces once reserved for old-school workout videos into your everyday wardrobe.  Pictured: Fenty Puma by Rihanna Spring 2018 From Calvin Klein to Valentino and Chanel, clear plastic outerwear (and footwear) is having a major revival. Whether you're facing a rainstorm √† la the models at Chanel's Spring 2018 show or you simply want to try standout PVC accessories, spring will undoubtedly be filled with clear shiny pieces.  Pictured: Chanel Spring 2018 A new wave of denim is here just in time to give your wardrobe a revamp. Dark wash denim ruled the runways in every form from classic jeans to two-piece sets, and structured dresses.  From left: Fendi, Tom Ford, Chloe They've all had a long run, and made for some good looks along the way, but it's time for us to collectively let go of skater merch, chokers, and off-the-shoulder tops‚Äîfor now. 
 The supermodel stars in the fast fashion retailer's new short film.  Back in the '90s, Naomi Campbell worked with H&M on a series of commercials and campaigns. Now, over 20 years later, the supermodel is joining forces with the Swedish retailer once again for its Fall 2017 campaign video.  Shot in Tokyo, the short film stars Campbell leading a lip sync karaoke session around the Japanese city. Offering a look at both Tokyo's nightlife scene and H&M's fall collection, the quirky video celebrates masculine-meets-feminine power dressing as models lip sync along to the 1980s hit, "WHAM!"  As for Campbell, she was excited to be working with H&M again. "It‚Äôs always an honor when a brand comes back to you 20 years later," she told BAZAAR.com."I love Tokyo, so any excuse to be there, I‚Äôm happy."  In the video, the supermodel wears a black double-breasted suit from H&M's fall range, which just so happens to be her favorite piece from the collection. "I loved the suit I wore in the campaign. It felt strong and sexy. You can wear it anywhere, anytime, over and over again. It‚Äôs nice for an elegant party‚Äîit goes with long hair or short hair...it‚Äôs just very chic."  That intersection of masculinity meets femininity is one of the trends Campbell is looking forward to most this fall. But after nearly three decades of working in the industry, what's exciting  her about fashion now? Looking beyond fall, Campbell says she thinks big changes are coming to the fashion world, "I think next year there‚Äôs going to be a new rage. Right now it feels like there‚Äôs a bit of a stillness and everyone‚Äôs at the crossroads, but I think that means there‚Äôs exciting times to come, and I don‚Äôt use that word often.‚Äù  And if you're wondering whether the supermodel had as much fun filming the campaign as the video looks, the answer is yes. "The whole set had really great vibes. The whole time I kept saying to myself, 'Am I really working?'" H&M's fall collection hits stores and hm.com on September 21st.

 It's her second flawless look of the day. Meghan Markle has had an incredibly busy weekend so far. Fresh from wearing the most perfect floral Self-Portrait dress this morning at an Invictus Games reception, Markle attended the Queen's Birthday Party concert this evening, dressed flawlessly in a Stella McCartney cape dress. Queen Elizabeth II turns 92 today, so celebrities and members of the public alike attended the concert in her honor. Markle arrived at the Royal Albert Hall in London with Prince William and Prince Harry. As Kate Middleton is due to give birth to her third baby any day now, she wasn't in attendance. Markle's sophisticated evening look combined fashion with formality. She paired her navy Stella by Stella McCartney cape dress, with a pair of Manolo Blahnik BB pumps.  She carried a chic Naeem Khan Armory Zodiac clutch bag to complete the outfit. Musicians including Sting, Sir Tom Jones, Kylie Minogue, Craig David, and Shaggy turned out for the Queen's Birthday Party concert, performing for the packed Royal Albert Hall. And, as usual, Prince Harry and Markle looked totally in love: Earlier today it was confirmed that Middleton's role in Prince Harry and Markle's May 19 wedding would likely be small, as she will have recently given birth. A source told Vanity Fair, "Frankly Harry and Meghan are just happy that Kate will be there given she will only just have given birth. They have told her there is no pressure on her to do anything, they just want her to enjoy the day."  Want more royals?

 The New York designer is one of 12 finalists for the competition.   The International Woolmark Prize is one of the most prestigious awards for emerging design talent. Launched in 1953, its past winners have included Gabriela Hearst, Karl Lagerfeld and Yves Saint Laurent. It's clear that their support can be a launchpad for future career success. Not only do winners take home a cash prize, but their collection gets picked up by a Woolmark retail partner and they also receive business mentorship which can be vital to up-and-coming brands. Three awards will be presented: womenswear, menswear and the innovation prize. Innovation is the focal point of the Woolmark Prize as designers are challenged to create something truly original and unique to their brand with Merino wool.  This weekend during London Fashion Week the 12 global finalists will present their six-piece collection in a group runway show. Alber Elbaz, Gwendoline Christie,  Laura Brown, Tim Blanks and Tiffany Hsu are just a few names who will judge the final competition  Representing the United States as one of three American finalists vying for the AU200,000 grand prize is New York design darling Brandon Maxwell. Colovos and Willy Chavarria are also in the running. Maxwell just debuted his Fall 2019 collection in New York while simultaneously working on his Woolmark Prize collection which will be comprised of activewear, a new area for the designer.  The Texas-born designer who is also known as Lady Gaga's longtime stylist, launched his own namesake collection for Spring 2016.  His brand has quickly become a red-carpet favorite worn by celebrities like Jennifer Aniston, Michelle Obama, Blake Lively, Tiffany Haddish, and Kerry Washington, just to name a few. His clothes are synonymous with glamorous and bold women‚Äîmuch like his original inspiration Lady Gaga. The designer makes quite the pivot, from ballgowns to activewear for his Woolmark Prize entry, but his motives remain the same. "It‚Äôs all about the women!" Maxwell told Bazaar, "they aren‚Äôt attending formal events every night, they have full lives, jobs and children! I wanted to give them something for those moments when they are off-duty." Sustainability is also a huge anchor to the Woolmark Prize, as they encourage brands to work more with Merino wool which is hugely versatile and completely biodegradable. On sustainability in the industry, Maxwell said, "I think it should be important to all fashion brands. Working with Woolmark gave me the opportunity to try my hand at new fabrications that are sustainable. I was fascinated to learn that when a Merino wool garment has reached the end of this wear, it can be added to organic compost, as wool fibers are biodegradable. I‚Äôm learning so much about wool and the environment and I‚Äôm happy to incorporate this fabric in my collections moving forward."   Stay tuned to find out the grand prize winners!
 She handled it like a boss...by not handling it at all. Nipples. People have them! So really, it's not that big of a deal when they're seen in public (actually, it's not a big deal at all). Which brings us to Bella Hadid's nip slip at Paris Fashion Week. While closing the Alexandre Vauthier show, Bella's black top slipped down, causing her to expose a little more skin than she presumably intended. (Or maybe this was on purpose because #fashion. Who knows, again, it's just a nipple.) Bella clearly was more focused on slaying the runway than worrying about her nip slip, and completely nailed her walk. (By the way, she has a history of not being concerned about wardrobe malfunctions.) And in other non-nipple related news, can we please talk about how this is the best shirt that has ever been created?

 "We abhor all forms of racism." This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. This week, Prada has issued an apology for some imagery featured in one of its recent campaigns.  Taking to Facebook on Thursday, lawyer Chinyere Ezie wrote, "I don‚Äôt make a lot of public posts, but right now I‚Äôm shaking with anger. Today after returning to NYC after a very emotional visit to the Smithsonian National Museum of African American history and Culture including an exhibit on blackface, I walked past Prada‚Äôs Soho storefront only to be confronted with the very same racist and denigrating #blackface imagery."  Ezie then spoke about how, once inside the store, she found even more examples of the offensive imagery, and discussed the campaign with a member of staff. In her Facebook post, Ezie asked other people to get involved in asking the brand to remove the examples:   Over two tweets, Prada apologized for the imagery, and vowed to remove any articles from its stores which had been construed as racist: [1/2] #Prada Group abhors racist imagery. The Pradamalia are fantasy charms composed of elements of the Prada oeuvre. They are imaginary creatures not intended to have any reference to the real world and certainly not blackface. [2/] #Prada Group never had the intention of offending anyone and we abhor all forms of racism and racist imagery.  In this interest we will withdraw the characters in question from display and circulation. BAZAAR.com reached out to Prada for further comment. SUBSCRIBE
 Your comprehensive guide on what to fall for this season. It's been scientifically proven that the act of shopping (or even just adding things to your Wish List), provides your body with a surge of happy endorphins, and why wouldn't it?! Whether you're pining over sleek suiting from Tibi or Rejina Pyo, or have bookmarked everything from Natacha Ramsay-Levi's first collection for Chlo√©, the new spring season has plenty to offer in terms of heart-pumping buys.  Belt bags have never been chicer. Whether you wear one slung around your waist or across the body (all the models are doing it), invest in a bright color to pack a sartorial punch.

Look for styles in bold hues and special details, like Attico's sweetheart front. Attico shoes, $655, net-a-porter.com SHOP Gucci remains a cult favorite, and red is the color of the season. If a head-to-toe ensemble is a little scary, opt for a silk blouse in a traditional silhouette.

 The singer-turned-designer shut down New York Fashion Week with a blowout runway event.  Rihanna is back gracing New York Fashion Week with her presence‚Äîand another jaw-dropping Savage x Fenty runway show. The singer-turned-designer presented her latest collection of lingerie with a full-on SHOW at Barclays Center in Brooklyn. With several musical performances (including from Halsey, Migos, and even Rihanna herself) and a star-studded front row, it's safe to say Bad Gal RiRi has triumphantly de-crowned the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show‚Äîand she did so with a diverse runway celebrating women of all sizes.    If you're wondering why you haven't seen any photos or videos from the runway show yet, it's because there was a strict no-phone policy for all attendees. Guests had to place their phones in locked cases to avoid any leaks or video footage from the runway since it will be streamed on September 20 via Amazon Prime Video.  Along with some of your favorite models‚Äîfrom Gigi and Bella Hadid to Cara Delevingne, Joan Smalls, and Slick Woods‚Äîa number of celebrities walked in the Savage x Fenty show. A mix of singers, actors, and dancers including Normani, Laverne Cox, 21 Savage, Paloma Elsesser, and Aquaria took the runway‚Äîwhich featured choreography by Parris Goebel. There was an emphasis on body movement and dance, as opposed to a traditional catwalk strut. "I love how she makes everything sexy despite society's ideal of what sexy looks," Rihanna told BoF in an interview after the show. "I don't care about any skinny Victoria's Secret model when I look at Parris. I want to be that woman on the inside. I want to feel that confident, I want to feel that bombastic ‚Ä¶ that is the Savage brand."  wow this was legit one of the most memorable nights of my entire existence. thank you to the queen herself @badgalriri for allowing me to be a part of HISTORY!!!!! YOU SET THE BAR YOU HEAR ME ‚ú® I love you beyond. shit can‚Äôt nobody tell me nothing. Thank you GOD A post shared by  Normani (@normani) on Sep 10, 2019 at 8:04pm PDT The runway event was topped off with a lineup of A-list musical performers including Migos, Halsey, DJ Khaled, Fabolous, A$AP Ferg, Big Sean, and even Rihanna herself. The performances were dispersed throughout the show.  But they weren't the only A-listers in attendance. The front row and red carpet were filled with celebrity attendees‚Äîincluding Kacey Musgraves,  Hailee Steinfeld, Vanessa Hudgens, Chanel Iman, Candace Swanepoel, Chris Rock, Diplo, Ashley Graham, Kehlani, Paris Hilton, Nicky Hilton, Monica, Lil Kim, Lisa Rinna, Skrillex, La La Anthony, Iskra Lawrence, and Saweetie.  Rihanna's latest collection is already live and available to shop online at Amazon Fashion. The new pieces include bra and underwear sets, as well as bodysuits, sexy lingerie, tank tops, and slips. Sizes range from 32A to 42H and XS to 3X. Rihanna's Savage x Fenty show will stream on Amazon Prime Video Friday, September 20. The event will be available to watch only on Amazon's platform, so if you don't have an account, either borrow a friend's password or sign up for a 30-day free trial.
 "Can I please cover my butt?" In a revealing new interview with PORTER magazine, supermodel Gisele B√ºndchen talked about everything from her marriage to Tom Brady, to her infamous break-up with Leonardo DiCaprio. B√ºndchen also discussed her incredible career with Victoria's Secret, and the clauses she had when wearing the brand's often-skimpy clothing. B√ºndchen‚Äîwho was the highest-paid model in the world for 15 consecutive years in a row‚Äîsigned a contract with Victoria's Secret when she was just 19.  Per The Independent, B√ºndchen got personal in her book, Lessons: My Path to a Meaningful Life. She revealed, "For the first five years, I felt comfortable modeling in lingerie, but as time went on, I felt less and less at ease being photographed walking the runway wearing just a bikini or a thong. Give me a tail, a cape, wings‚Äîplease, anything to cover me up a little!"   In the model's new interview with PORTER magazine, B√ºndchen confirmed her growing unease with wearing revealing clothes. She explained, "I was always a person who asked, 'Can I please cover my butt?' In the studio I don‚Äôt mind, it‚Äôs very controlled. But if you‚Äôre on a runway, god knows. So, you‚Äôll notice, I usually had a little skirt or cape to wear. They were always very kind and accommodating when I said I did not feel comfortable." Speaking of her impressive credentials, the supermodel credits her success to her hard work: "I don‚Äôt know how I would have achieved anything in my life if I didn‚Äôt have discipline. Discipline is my best friend!" SUBSCRIBE
 Bazaar's Editor-in-Chief reminisces on her relationship with the late fashion photographer. Yesterday the world lost one of its most gifted photographers, my friend and longtime collaborator Peter Lindbergh. Over the years, Peter created dozens of iconic images and award-winning portfolios for Harper‚Äôs Bazaar. My favorite one, a hauntingly beautiful image of Amber Valletta dressed in a white tuxedo with oversize angel wings walking through the streets of New York, currently hangs in my lobby. His instantly recognizable photographs, which intimately captured the very essence of his subjects, were‚Äîand will always remain¬≠‚Äîamong the most arresting and seductive images ever.  One of the greatest aspects of my job is that I am able to collaborate with living legends, people who were my heroes as I came up through the ranks as a young editor. Peter Lindbergh was‚Äîfrom the beginning‚Äîright up at the top of my list, and I am forever grateful to Stephen Gan for introducing me to Peter all those years ago. Peter had an incredible warmth about him, which charmed everyone who came into his orbit (yes, even Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, who posted her own glowing tribute to Peter on Instagram this morning). We had a long-running joke between us about my ‚Äúpassion for blue skies and smiles.‚Äù He was, of course, known for his moody black-and-white photography. But as it turned out he was able to give me‚Äîand Bazaar‚Äîthe best of both worlds: images that were at once evocative and jubilant; images that made us smile and pause to wonder.    My relationship with Peter was both personal and professional, as we became great friends over the years. One of my favorite memories is sitting around his kitchen table during the collections‚Äîenjoying the most delicious food cooked by his wife, Petra‚Äîwhile we brainstormed ideas until four in the morning. I had to be at my seat in the front row by nine the next morning, but that never stopped us: It was our ritual, and he loved it.  Nobody could make a woman look and feel more beautiful in front of a camera than Peter.Glenda Bailey  Time and again, I would present him with the most outrageous ideas and he would somehow find a way of turning them into iconic imagery. One of our most memorable projects involved Chlo√´ Sevigny, who we convinced to pose in a cautionary portfolio entitled, ‚ÄúThey Tried to Make Me Go to Rehab.‚Äù The 2007 shoot underscored the exploitative coverage of the tabloid media at a time when many celebrities seemed to be going off the deep end with increasing frequency. Fashion photography, like any other art form, is meant to reflect its moment in time. And with this story, like so many others Peter produced for us, he knew how to capture the zeitgeist with his lens like no other.   Nobody could make a woman look and feel more beautiful in front of a camera than Peter. For our September 2009 issue, before it was trendy to do so, he shot a portfolio of supermodels without makeup. To this day, it is one of our best-performing stories online. And who could forget his jaw-dropping photo of Kate Winslet hanging off a scaffold high above Manhattan?   Whether he was shooting Ellen DeGeneres as the first female president in 2004 or his own wife with model Angela Lindvall in a peace-themed fashion portfolio, Peter had a remarkable ability to transport the viewer to a place of fantasy and imagination. There was a gentle seduction to his work that will live on in our hearts and minds forever.  I will miss you, my dear friend Peter. May your days be filled with endless blue skies and smiles.   
 They bring that Balmain "troublemaker" glamour you're after. Balmain's Fall 2019 runway was inspired by the idea of the "troublemaker," and we can't think of two things that represent that idea better than black leather and friend-of-the-house Cara Delevigne. With that mood in mind, Olivier Rousteing, creative director of Balmain, and supermodel Delevingne collaborated to create three new Balmain bags‚Äìtwo of which drop today. "Cara is also the star [of the campaign] because it's clear to everyone that she is the embodiment of the Balmain rebelle‚Äîthe self-assured troublemaker with an invigorating, new type of rebellious spirit," Rousteing explained. "Cara reflects the strong and confident attitude of the women of my generation, women who are not content to simply push back‚Äîinstead, they revel in pushing forward, (while making sure to push every single button along the way)."  Rousteing said he was partly inspired by Delevingne's spirit, as she seemingly leans into life's paradoxes effortlessly. "She's got attitude; she is a troublemaker, and she doesn't care,‚Äù Rousteing said. "She's defiant, but she is a paradox: She can be sweet and romantic too; she can be an angel, or she can be a devil. She cannot be categorized." The three bags‚Äîthe BBag (which launched May 23), the Romeo and the Twist‚Äîalso mark the first collaboration between Rousteing and Delevingne. Still, Delevingne has long held ties with the luxury brand, having previously opened shows and posed in campaigns. Though all three bags feature quilted black leather and gold accents, each maintains an arresting identity of its own. The BBag is effortless yet elegant. The Romeo is intimidating yet whimsical. The Twist is quaint yet empowering. To want to be two different things at once, this Rousteing-Delevingne collaboration seems to suggest, is not at all impossible. 
 From all the celebrity sightings to the collection inspiration.  Tonight, Riccardo Tisci closed out London Fashion Week with his third collection for Burberry. From the star-studded front rows to theme of the collection, below are a few takeaways from the evening.  Since taking over Burberry in 2018, there's been one noticeable difference about the Burberry shows‚Äîno celebrities. Burberry was always known for drawing scores of iconic British names like Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Eddie Redmayne and many more. Even Riccardo Tisci himself was known for having a stellar front row while designing for the house of Givenchy, Kim Kardashian was often sitting front row.  This season, Tisci finally extended the invite to some famous fans and notable newcomers. We spotted British singer Dua Lipa, and boyfriend Anwar Hadid (whose sisters walked the show), and Euphoria's breakout star Hunter Schaffer. Spanish songstress Rosalia made her fashion week debut at the show‚Äî the singer recently hit the VMA's stage in custom-Burberry, so it was little surprise that she showed up for Tisci's show. R&B singer Brent Faiyez, British actress Naomi Scott, FKA twigs and Carla Bruni were all present for the Spring 2020 catwalk.  2. The collection's theme was "evolution" Tisci continues to mine the archives to help shape the future of this new era at Burberry. "My first year at Burberry was about understanding and refining the new codification for the house. With that foundation in place, I feel ready to start exploring what‚Äôs at the heart of this incredible brand. Tisci wants to honor founder Thomas Burberry for the innovator he was, but also the dreamer and romantic.  As we've seen in the last two seasons, Tisci still presented two different sides to the Burberry story‚Äîthe refined pieces for the woman who means business and the relaxed side for the streetwear enthusiasts. This season the transition felt a little more seamless as the business-ready monochrome suiting and neutral dresses made room for thigh-grazing shirt dresses and contrasting two-pieces.    One of London's coolest models of the mid-aughts had been in runway retirement until tonight. The last time Deyn was seen on a runway was back in 2015 for Saint Laurent, she often worked with the former creative director Christopher Bailey during her heyday so it seems only right for her to make a return on the Burberry runway.    After skipping New York Fashion Week, Jenner made her fashion month debut at the show with blonde locks. It's unconfirmed whether it's a wig or not, but we wouldn't be surprised if she got inspired by her best friend Bella.  When is a white dress more than just a white dress? There were a few noticeably romantic ivory dresses in the lineup that we could envision for only the coolest of brides, especially this white sheath with crystal mesh overlay and a feathered tail that invoked a unicorn vibe.

 From Coco Chanel to Marc Jacobs and Bill Cunningham, words to live by from fashion's greatest forces.  It can be difficult to articulate the power of style and fashion through words, but these icons managed to do so with quote-worthy, inspiring words of wisdom to live by. From the greatest fashion designers to legendary models and stylists, get inspired by these 50 quotes that will never go out of style.  ‚ÄúFashion is part of the daily air and it changes all the time, with all the events. You can even see the approaching of a revolution in clothes. You can see and feel everything in clothes.‚Äù ‚ÄîDiana Vreeland "Don't be into trends. Don't make fashion own you, but you decide what you are, what you want to express by the way you dress and the way to live." ‚ÄîGianni Versace "One is never over-dressed or under-dressed with a Little Black Dress." ‚ÄîKarl Lagerfeld "What you wear is how you present yourself to the world, especially today, when human contacts are so quick. Fashion is instant language." ‚ÄîMiuccia Prada  "I firmly believe that with the right footwear one can rule the world." ‚ÄîBette Midler "You can have anything you want in life if you dress for it." ‚ÄîEdith Head  "I like my money right where I can see it‚Ä¶hanging in my closet." ‚ÄîCarrie Bradshaw "Fashion is about dressing according to what‚Äôs fashionable. Style is more about being yourself." ‚ÄîOscar de la Renta "I think there is beauty in everything. What 'normal' people perceive as ugly, I can usually see something of beauty in it."‚ÄîAlexander McQueen "Style is something each of us already has, all we need to do is find it." ‚ÄîDiane von Furstenberg "Fashion is the armor to survive the reality of everyday life." ‚ÄîBill Cunningham "When in doubt, wear red." ‚ÄîBill Blass "I don't design clothes. I design dreams." ‚ÄîRalph Lauren  "Fashions fade, style is eternal." ‚ÄîYves Saint Laurent "Anyone can get dressed up and glamorous, but it is how people dress in their days off that are the most intriguing." ‚ÄîAlexander Wang "How can you live the high life if you do not wear the high heels?" ‚ÄîSonia Rykiel  "In difficult times, fashion is always outrageous." ‚ÄîElsa Schiaparelli "Clothes mean nothing until someone lives in them." ‚ÄîMarc Jacobs "You gotta have style. It helps you get down the stairs. It helps you get up in the morning. It‚Äôs a way of life. Without it, you‚Äôre nobody. I‚Äôm not talking about lots of clothes.‚Äù ‚ÄîDiana Vreeland "Fashion is very important. It is life-enhancing and, like everything that gives pleasure, it is worth doing well.‚Äù ‚ÄîVivienne Westwood "You can never take too much care over the choice of your shoes. Too many women think that they are unimportant, but the real proof of an elegant woman is what is on her feet." ‚ÄîChristian Dior "Fashion is what you're offered four times a year by designers. And style is what you choose." ‚ÄîLauren Hutton "The dress must follow the body of a woman, not the body following the shape of the dress." ‚ÄîHubert de Givenchy "I always find beauty in things that are odd and imperfect, they are much more interesting." ‚ÄîMarc Jacobs "Fashion you can buy, but style you possess. The key to style is learning who you are, which takes years. There's no how-to road map to style. It's about self expression and, above all, attitude." ‚ÄîIris Apfel "Style is a way to say who you are without having to speak." ‚ÄîRachel Zoe "Trendy is the last stage before tacky." ‚ÄîKarl Lagerfeld "People will stare. Make it worth their while." ‚ÄîHarry Winston  "Elegance is elimination." ‚ÄîCrist√≥bal Balenciaga "Shoes transform your body language and attitude. They lift you physically and emotionally.‚Äù ‚ÄîChristian Louboutin  "Style is the only thing you can‚Äôt buy. It‚Äôs not in a shopping bag, a label, or a price tag. It‚Äôs something reflected from our soul to the outside world‚Äîan emotion.‚Äù‚ÄîAlber Elbaz "In order to be irreplaceable one must always be different." ‚ÄîCoco Chanel "We must never confuse elegance with snobbery." ‚ÄîYves Saint Laurent  "Fashion is like eating, you shouldn't stick to the same menu." ‚ÄîKenzo Takada  "Playing dress-up begins at age five and never truly ends." ‚ÄîKate Spade "Elegance is not standing out, but being remembered." ‚ÄîGiorgio Armani  "The hardest thing in fashion is not to be known for a logo, but to be known for a silhouette." ‚ÄîGiambattista Valli "I want people to see the dress, but focus on the woman." ‚ÄîVera Wang "We have this saying, Christy and I. We don't wake up for less than $10,000 a day." ‚ÄîLinda Evangelista  "I make clothes, women make fashion." ‚ÄîAzzedine Ala√Øa  "What‚Äôs my style is not your style, and I don‚Äôt see how you can define it. It‚Äôs something that expresses who you are in your own way.‚Äù ‚ÄîIris Apfel "Over the years I have learned that what is important in a dress is the woman who's wearing it." ‚ÄîYves Saint Laurent "Whoever said that money can't buy happiness, simply didn't know where to go shopping." ‚ÄîBo Derek "Girls do not dress for boys. They dress for themselves, and of course, each other. If girls dressed for boys, they‚Äôd just walk around naked at all times.‚Äù ‚ÄîBetsey Johnson  "I don't do fashion. I am fashion." ‚ÄîCoco Chanel  "The joy of dressing is an art." ‚ÄîJohn Galliano "Luxury is the ease of a t-shirt in a very expensive dress." ‚ÄïKarl Lagerfeld "Being well dressed hasn‚Äôt much to do with having good clothes. It‚Äôs a question of good balance and good common sense.‚Äù ‚ÄîOscar de la Renta   "A little bad taste is like a nice splash of paprika. We all need a splash of bad taste‚Äîit's hearty, it's healthy, it's physical. I think we could use more of it. No taste is what I'm against." ‚ÄîDiana Vreeland "The best things in life are free. The second best are very expensive." ‚ÄîCoco Chanel
 The style icons are featured in Roger Vivier's new book, '#LoveVivier,' which explores the influence of fashion in the age of Instagram. Read an exclusive excerpt. Leandra Medine: Hi! How are you? It‚Äôs good to hear your voice. Ines de la Fressange: Ah, yeah, it‚Äôs fun. Where are you? Are you in New York?   L: I am. I‚Äôm in my apartment right now‚Äîit‚Äôs very hot here!   IF: I‚Äôve spent the whole day working in the garden. I thought it would be a good office for the day, to lie out on the soil. And how are you? L: I‚Äôm good! Quite busy with work.   IF: Do you work a lot?   L: I do.   IF: We‚Äôre supposed to talk about Instagram, aren‚Äôt we?   L: Well, yes, and we‚Äôre supposed to talk about Roger Vivier on Instagram, but knowing you and knowing me, we are probably going to talk around it. IF: I think Instagram reveals a lot about people.   L: How so?   IF: Well, there are some unknown people whom I love, because of their sense of humor or choice of pictures, and some others that just show pictures of themselves in splendid hotels or luxury places, and I hate them [laughs]. Just based on these few pictures, we form our opinions and choose to follow someone but not someone else. Nowadays, everybody wants to be judged and everybody wants to show the best side of himself or herself. L: I actually disagree. Your daughters are teenagers, right?   IF: Yes.   L: I don‚Äôt know if this is true in Europe, but in the United States, we‚Äôre seeing raw, unedited footage from the younger communities. They have separate accounts, one for pretty pictures and one for ‚Äúreal‚Äù pictures, and often the ‚Äúreal‚Äù picture accounts have larger followings. They‚Äôre gravitating toward truth in a way that is quite refreshing. IF: That‚Äôs the real difference between generations. No way would my daughter put a very glamorous picture of herself on Instagram, but she might choose to share a weird or funny situation. You know, after so many years being in the magazine world, trying to take the best pictures that are sophisticated‚Äîsuddenly, pictures that wouldn‚Äôt have been shown before are being seen. Because that‚Äôs what we like! L: What role do you feel Roger Vivier plays on Instagram?   IF: Roger Vivier‚Äôs Instagram is not a catalog; it is there to show the spirit of the house, sometimes I feel like we are still searching, trying to figure it out, between you and me. L: Oh, that doesn‚Äôt have to stay between you and me; everyone is always trying to figure it out. I think the trouble is that we don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs OK to be searching, but sometimes the real beauty is precisely in the process. And showing the process! IF: You have it figured out with your sense of humor. That‚Äôs why I love what you‚Äôre doing. Fashion should bring some lightness and some fun, but the real talent is being able to have fun and show fun‚Äîand stay elegant. It‚Äôs not the easiest thing to do. L: No, it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs all about nuance and being understated in all of your intentions. If you hit everyone over the head trying to be funny, it‚Äôs not funny at all. As a matter of fact, it can be kind of sad. But if you have a sense of humor, and you respect fashion, then it‚Äôs a completely different game. You‚Äôre not making fun of the industry, you‚Äôre not making fun of the work, you‚Äôre just having fun with yourself and your work. Do you think that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre such a good fit at Roger Vivier? Because you bring that essence, that sense of humor, and that joviality with you to your work? IF: Well, I‚Äôve been here since the beginning and when we started there was no administration; it was just like Steve Jobs working in a garage, nobody could imagine it. And when we did the opening of the shop, we hired an agency to organize our party, and they asked me, ‚ÄúWould you like to have limos to go and fetch celebrities?‚Äù And I said, ‚ÄúNo! They‚Äôre used to limos,‚Äù so we sent them checkered cabs and double-decker buses. I found that to be more luxurious. L: That must have given the brand so much soul.   IF: ‚ÄúDare to be different‚Äù‚Äîthat‚Äôs my motto.   L: Do you use social media yourself?   IF: Yes, I have an Instagram account. But I don‚Äôt go there regularly. Sometimes people complain, saying I should post more pictures of myself. L: Why don‚Äôt you?   IF: Sometimes I put up vintage pictures, and I say something like, ‚ÄúThis is my grandma in the twenties or the thirties,‚Äù and people will say, ‚ÄúOh! She looks just like you. It‚Äôs amazing!‚Äù And it‚Äôs actually just a picture of me. There‚Äôs no need to be too precious or pretentious with social media; the photos come and go so quickly. But I have learned that the most successful pictures are those of dogs or flowers. So I put up dogs and flowers. But never really myself in the bathroom making a selfie. L: That‚Äôs the other nuance of social media‚Äîor it‚Äôs not just social media, it‚Äôs life. You can‚Äôt be anything that you‚Äôre not. That‚Äôs how a lot of this conversation starts. And it‚Äôs ironic because Instagram is all about presenting a perfect life, and yet, we know from anthropological history, from having souls and being people in the world, that it is dissatisfying and challenging to succeed if you‚Äôre trying to be someone you‚Äôre not. Whom do you follow on social media? IF: I like to know what‚Äôs going on in the fashion world. I follow editors and writers and some photographers, but a lot of unknown people as well. L: What do you find that you use Instagram for?   IF: There are fashion shows that I don‚Äôt go to, but it‚Äôs nice to see how they looked, which we see immediately, so I use it to see the events I was not at. Other times it can be for inspiration. I follow a lot of people that put up vintage pictures of films and actors and some people that make drawings of comics. But I‚Äôm not really a maniac about Instagram, it‚Äôs not my life like it is for some people. For some reason, I always feel bad showing the things I‚Äôve been doing, but I know that each time I put up a Roger Vivier handbag or a pair of shoes, people love them. And it‚Äôs very funny to see the reactions, because sometimes I find that I put things quite simple but it‚Äôs the shoes or the boots I‚Äôm wearing, that I perhaps find too simple for Instagram, that people like the most. L: Why, then, in your opinion, should a consumer buy Roger Vivier shoes?   IF: Well, if you‚Äôre only wearing white jeans and a navy blue sweater, or a cotton button-down shirt, you put on any pair of Roger Vivier shoes, and they transform the look. It‚Äôs not very easy to find shoes that are at the same time trendy but not boring and still elegant. The other day our stylist was here and she gave me some white jeans and a peacoat, then boots with a small heel, and the outfit was interesting because of the boots. The good thing about Vivier is that you don‚Äôt need a lot to look good. And it‚Äôs magic! You give them to your mother, she‚Äôs going to look great. Give them to your best friend, she‚Äôs going to look great, too. But then again, we‚Äôre all moody. Sometimes, we want to be in all black, and other times we want to wear the most sophisticated, crazy-colored shoe. And many women I know are like this; we want one thing then the opposite. With Vivier, it‚Äôs a twist, a mix of both of these sides that we have. It‚Äôs like the final touch. You can almost compare it to perfume‚Äîsome people are sensitive to it, some people are not, but it makes a big difference. L: These are such great stories! Do you ever use social media to tell them? IF: In a way, yes, I never want our social media to look like a catalog. It should always represent the feeling, mood, and attitude of our company. It‚Äôs exactly like making a present for people who like art. The purpose is not to sell the thing we‚Äôre showing, but to capture the atmosphere of the house. #LoveVivier, a tome in honor of iconic brand Roger Vivier, published by Rizzoli, explores fashion in the digital age and goes on sale at the end of this month.  
 "Are you wearing...the Chanel rain boots? Yeah, I am."  Leave it to Karl Lagerfeld to make dressing for a torrential downpour something to look forward to. Today, at Chanel's Spring 2018 show in Paris, the designer unveiled a collection filled with clear PVC rainwear‚Äîfrom bags to hats to caped ponchos. But it was the clear boots topping off every single look that really stole the show.  Ranging in height from mid-calf to over-the-knee, the high fashion rain boots feature the brand's signature cap-toe in both white and black. Paired with everything from tweed mini skirts to culottes, suits, and ruffled gowns, the boots proved their versatility in a wide-range of looks hitting the runway.  Of course, the rainwear came in handy for models at the show‚Äîwho walked down a runway featuring cascading waterfalls. Embracing the calming backdrop of nature, this season's set included giant cliffs, mossy green trees, and serene waterfalls.  A paradise at #ChanelSpringSummer!

 And introducing her debut bag collection of minimal masterpieces.  Jenni Kayne is more than just a designer, she‚Äôs a lifestyle mogul that‚Äôs changing the way we approach fashion and personal style.    What inspires your designs?California. Nature. Travel. Landscapes. Architecture. I like the idea of warm minimalism. I like whole, natural fabrics and materials that are made to be worn and lived in. I‚Äôm inspired by strong women who dress well all the time, while never sacrificing their comfort for the sake of fashion. I really believe in living well and taking time to slow down in order to take care of our bodies and minds.  Describe the Jenni Kayne brand and aesthetic.There‚Äôs an earthiness and effortlessness to everything that I design and curate which feels very California, but the brand and my aesthetic is very classic at the same time. I believe in investing in quality over quantity and so a lot of the items are done in neutral colors that can be worn in a number of ways, season after season. Layering beautiful textures is something that defines the Jenni Kayne look, but since everything is quite pared down it has a minimalist, modern feel. Who do you envision wearing your designs?Woman of all ages who really live in their clothes and don‚Äôt want to sacrifice style for comfort‚Äîor vice versa. We appeal to women who want classic, effortless staples they can use to create a personal uniform. What made you decide to create a line of bags?I‚Äôve always wanted to make handbags but wanted to wait until the right time. Our brand has hit an amazing stride over the last couple of years and we knew this was the moment for it, creatively and otherwise. There are a lot of beautiful bags on the market right now but nothing this streamlined, with this quality, at this price, in these colors.   Favorite style icons?There are too many to name! I‚Äôve always loved Jane Birkin and Lauren Hutton. I think they both proved that simple, effortless style can also be sexy, personal and interesting. They made the idea of ‚Äúless is more‚Äù exciting. Lifestyle philosophy?I really believe in living well and taking time to slow down in order to take care of our bodies and minds. I think that means paying attention to our health, diet and spiritual well-being and appreciating the small details in life. Being mindful of what you put in and on your body, how the table is set and the bed is made, and how your clothes feel against your skin and what they do to highlight your form‚Äîthese are the small details that actually make life richer and more joyful to me. They are little ways of showing gratitude and celebrating how lucky we are to be alive. How has your style changed over the years?I think becoming a mother forced me to come up with a uniform that reflects my personal style as well as my lifestyle. I love that it takes the effort out of getting dressed every day and forces me to find ways to feel sexy without automatically reaching for high heels, or feel dressed up without necessarily wearing something form-fitting. It‚Äôs one of those challenges that makes your style more interesting, cooler and more comfortable too. What empowers you?The idea of living life to the fullest always inspires me. You never know what tomorrow brings. I try to stay in the moment, stay positive and allow myself to feel grateful every day.  Soothing feverfew tea relieves headaches and calms anxiety. Learn how to make your own using ingredients from your garden on #ripandtan A post shared by  Jenni Kayne | Apparel & Home (@jennikayne) on Mar 28, 2017 at 3:57pm PDT Describe a typical, off-duty weekend for you.A hike with my kids and husband and two labradoodles, Chachi and The Dude. A big family brunch, which is my favorite meal. Riding with my daughter Ripley. A nap or just laying around and taking time to relax. Cooking at home‚ÄîI love to cook. What can we expect from future Jenni Kayne collections?This winter we are launching our first home collection, which I am thrilled about. It‚Äôs a natural extension of the brand; decorating and interior design is a passion of mine and we carry numerous talented home designers in the store already. Travel plans this fall?We are traveling a Jenni Kayne Airstream across the country to celebrate the launch of Jenni Kayne Home! I am really excited to join a few legs of the trip‚ÄîI am particularly excited to go to Austin for the first time in October. My travel essentials for any trip are a big cashmere sweater for the plane, pouches to keep everything in my bag organized, healthy snacks for my kids, an eye mask and facial mist, and something inspiring to read. Go-to uniform?High-waisted jeans and one of my button-down shirts and mule slides. And then a nice knit if the weather calls for it. Your skincare routine?I stick with natural products almost exclusively and love hydrating products in all forms, whether it‚Äôs a cleansing balm or facial oil. For facials I see Terri Lawton and Kristina Holey. I do facial acupuncture as part of my full body acupuncture once a week with Sherri Mathews. Most memorable fashion moment?I‚Äôll never forget all of my experiences from first starting out to my first show to the first time I saw someone I didn‚Äôt know wearing my clothes. I try to stay present or look forward both in work and personal life but I love to remember these special moments and experiences once in a while. It‚Äôs important to recognize how far you‚Äôve come!  I try to stay present or look forward both in work and personal life but I love to remember these special moments and experiences once in a while. It‚Äôs important to recognize how far you‚Äôve come!   Tips for layering/transitional wear in the fall?You get a lot of practice layering for transitional weather in LA and Southern California so I feel like I have it down to a science at this point. It‚Äôs really about collecting beautiful, lightweight knitwear that you can add and remove to basically any outfit as the weather raises and dips throughout the day. When it gets really cold those same knits can be worn all day under proper outerwear. Why is the ShopBAZAAR HERO so special?Like my apparel and shoe collections, I wanted my handbags to be classic and beautifully made in shapes and sizes that every woman needs. We used the most amazing Italian vachetta leather in neutral colors that would really work hard in a woman‚Äôs wardrobe. The saddle shape is a nod to my enduring love of riding and equestrian style. I think it really adds something to an outfit without distracting from the other items, or the woman wearing it. Jenni Kayne bags, $475, shopbazaar.com SHOP
 A look at Bella, Gigi, and Anwar's childhood.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window.

 The brand has vowed to eliminate all virgin plastic in its apparel, shoes, accessories, and packaging by 2021.   As sustainability becomes a more crucial topic of concern in the fashion industry, Everlane is leading the way with its environmentally-conscious endeavors. Last week, the brand announced its plans to eliminate all virgin plastic from its supply chain by the year 2021 along with a new collection made from recycled plastic bottles. The collection, aptly called 'ReNew,' is now available to shop online and in stores.    "Plastic is destroying our planet and there is only one solution: stop creating virgin plastic and renew what‚Äôs already here. Companies have to take the lead and any company that hasn't made this commitment is actively choosing to not improve our environment," Everlane Founder and CEO Michael Preysman said in a statement from the brand.  Everlanes's first ReNew collection consists of men's and women's puffer coats, fleece sweaters, and parkas made from 3 million recycled plastic bottles. Prices range from $55 for a fleece sweater to $175 for a long puffer coat. According to a release from the brand, the ReNew collection will later launch new products and collections and within 5 years, 100 million plastic bottles will be recycled through the initiative. The ReNew collection is just the first step in the brand's journey towards going fully virgin plastic-free. In a press release, Everlane detailed its three-year plan to eliminating all new plastic: By the year 2021, all of Everlane's apparel, footwear, accessories, and packaging will be free of virgin plastic and made entirely from recycled alternatives.  This is hardly the brand's first foray into utilizing recycled materials, however. Last year, Everlane launched its first denim collection made at Saitex, a factory that recycles 98% of its water, runs on alternative energy, and repurposes byproducts to make bricks for affordable housing. Then in August, the brand unveiled its Clean Silk collection, another eco-friendly effort working towards growing all silk through regenerative farming, eventually dyeing and washing it with 100% recycled water and 100% renewable energy. At a time when brands across all industries are struggling to become more sustainable, it's worth taking note from Everlane's ongoing ethical initiatives. 
 It‚Äôs Prime time, baby. Being online today means to be inundated with the rapid-fire news cycle, scrolling rabbit holes, and an infinite amount of shopping choices. Should you, for instance, buy decor from Etsy or Craigslist? Seek inspiration from Pinterest or Instagram? Thankfully, there is the occasional light at the end of the digital tunnel, and Amazon‚Äôs new Personal Shopper wants to lead you to it.  Yesterday, Amazon launched Personal Shopper by Prime Wardrobe, a new kind of personal shopping experience fitting for the age of the Internet. Accessed through Amazon‚Äôs app on your smartphone, Personal Shopper sorts through more than half a million items already available on Prime Wardrobe for you. Participating brands include the likes of Calvin Klein, Levi‚Äôs, Rebecca Taylor, and Adidas. To begin, you complete a survey about your different style preferences (from which patterns and prints you like to which sizes you wear). Afterward, Amazon‚Äôs fashion stylist curates a set of recommendations, personalized according to your inclinations.

 The VS Angel clarifies her comment: "I will not take of my clothes anymore for [an] empty cause." Adriana Lima has clarified that she is not leaving Victoria's Secret, despite the now-viral Instagram she shared yesterday, in which she stated: "I will not take of my clothes anymore for a [sic] empty cause." Fans of the VS Angel wondered if Lima was hinting at retiring from the lingerie brand, but a spokesperson for the model promptly shut those rumors down.  "As Adriana mentioned in her post she received a recent offer where she was not aligned with the direction," a rep for Lima told People. "Adriana is blessed to be able to work with all of the brands she does including Victoria‚Äôs Secret." It turns out, working with Victoria's Secret was not the "empty cause" she was referring to. Instead, Lima meant to send "a message of female empowerment" with the Instagram post, People reports. The 36-year-old model has a long history with the brand, after making her VS Fashion Show debut in 1999. Just last month, she walked her 18th show with the label in Shanghai, proving she's a true VSFS runway veteran and mentor for VS rookies. Even though her fellow seasoned VS Angel, Alessandra Ambrosio, hung up her wings after this year's show, Lima assured she's not quitting anytime soon. She plans to walk at least two more shows before retiring.  "I plan to be at 20. Two more years. Maybe more, I don‚Äôt know," Lima told People last month. "It‚Äôs nature. I‚Äôm working out, I‚Äôm being healthy, so let‚Äôs see how the body is going to turn out. But I enjoy it. So let‚Äôs say 20."

 While walking the Tom Ford show. Kendall Jenner has given up commercial activism for a second and gone back to her day job: Walking runways with what her mama gave her. And it seems that at least for her showing at the Tom Ford show (which sister Kim also made a splash at, albeit as an attendee), she quite literally rocked a Kris Jenner look, that black ruffled pixie cut in particular. Even the sleek one-shoulder gown isn't so far off from something Kris would wear, after all. But the familial resemblance didn't stop either Jenner from posting the outfit. Kendall shared a runway snap on her Instagram:  Tom Ford A post shared by  Kendall (@kendalljenner) on Sep 6, 2017 at 9:04pm PDT And Kris went into mom mode, with the caption, "My beauty @kendalljenner walking for @tomford tonight! #NYFW#TomFord #SS18 #TomFordSS18 #NYC #proudmama":  My beauty @kendalljenner walking for @tomford tonight! #NYFW #TomFord #SS18 #TomFordSS18 #NYC #proudmama A post shared by  Kris Jenner (@krisjenner) on Sep 6, 2017 at 8:09pm PDT The family that dresses and looks the same together, stays together?

 "I want to be clear. The respect that I have for my peers is immeasurable!" Update, 8/21: Kendall Jenner has responded to the backlash against her recent comments about other models in the industry. In a recent interview with Love magazine, Jenner was quoted saying she "was never one of those girls who would do like 30 shows a season or whatever the f*ck those girls do."  However, the 22-year-old tweeted this evening that her "words were taken out of context." She went on to praise her fellow models' "tireless commitment" and work ethic. "I want to be clear. The respect that I have for my peers is immeasurable!" she wrote. Read her tweets below: I was misrepresented in a recent interview over the wknd & it‚Äôs important to clarify the meaning. It was intended to be entirely complimentary but unfortunately, my words were twisted & taken out of context.I want to be clear. The respect that I have for my peers is immeasurable! I get to experience first hand their tireless commitment, their work ethic, the endless days, the lack of sleep, separation from family and friends, stress of traveling, the toll on physical and mental health, yet they still make it all look effortless and beautiful. I‚Äôm inspired by so many of these people i have had the good fortune to work alongside! There‚Äôs no way i could EVER hate on that ‚ù§Ô∏è i want everyone to win. SLAY ALWAYS. Cultivate kindness today and always. Update, 8/20: After Kendall Jenner came under fire for her recent comments about other models in the industry, a rep for the 22-year-old star clarified her remarks to BAZAAR.com: "It‚Äôs not what she meant. The quote was taken out of context. Mid-thought she realized the number of shows some models walk a season is closer to 80. The point was that it‚Äôs their path and 'the more power to them.' She admires their hard work and dedication. It‚Äôs an accomplishment." Original story, 8/20: Kendall Jenner is facing backlash from other models after admitting she ‚Äúwas never one of those girls who would do like 30 shows a season or whatever the f*ck those girls do,‚Äù in reference to her own modeling career. Other runway stars are calling out the 22-year-old for her "offensive" comments, accusing the reality star of being disrespectful to hard-working models in the industry, many of whom walk several shows a season to earn money. Others are proudly sharing their struggles of working in the modeling industry. The controversy stems from a quote Jenner gave Love magazine, which the publication shared on Instagram over the weekend. ‚ÄúSince the beginning we‚Äôve been super selective about what shows I would do,‚Äù Jenner said, adding: ‚ÄúI had a million jobs, not only catwalks but everything else.‚Äù   ‚ÄúSince the beginning we‚Äôve been super selective about what shows I would do. I was never one of those girls who would do like 30 shows a season or whatever the fuck those girls do. More power to ‚Äòem. But I had a million jobs, not only catwalks but everything else. The whole combination was very overwhelming and I started to freak out a little bit and needed to take a step back,‚Äù says the 22-year-old, admitting that she ‚Äúwas on the verge of a mental breakdown.‚Äù #LOVE20

Strokous pointed out that "'whatever the f*ck those girls do' is do their very best to make their way up AND try to make some money so that they can provide for themselves and their families," she wrote on an Instagram story.  "Oh, and it's 70 shows a season by the way and we all are f*cking proud of every single of the girls that did it," she added. She went on to post a stream of photos of models on the runway, getting ready backstage, and attending castings.  "All of that because we're f*cking fearless and working with all these designers is a f*cking dream come true and nothing compares to the 10 seconds of walking on that runway," she concluded.  Daria Strokous took her time and went 'beyond' responding to Kendall Jenner's statements in her Instagram Stories, naming and making reference to some of her runway colleagues, "We are fucking fearless" pic.twitter.com/uapCJHmuWm "I‚Äôm shocked but not surprised by this attitude," Anderson tweeted. "Not everyone gets to skip castings, get paid more than everyone else and generally work less- it‚Äôs not about being 'selective', it‚Äôs about not having to put the work in but still receiving all the campaigns and editorials." I‚Äôm shocked but not surprised by this attitude.

 Meet Giovanna, the new brand that's nailing the chic Italian look.  It's officially that time of year when it feels like everyone is vacationing along the coast of Italy while you're at your desk crying (unless you're one of the lucky ones). But if you don't have a trip to Positano or Capri booked this summer, a new shoe brand is here to give you your Italian fix anyway.  In a sea of quickly passing trends seemingly tailored for Instagram, Leonora Arslani found herself looking to old photos and memories of her late great aunt Giovanna for style inspiration instead. So much so that she decided to launch Giovanna, a brand inspired by‚Äîand named after‚Äîher chic Italian aunt.  "I was named for my great aunt Giovanna (Giovanna is my middle name) and always felt connected to her," Arslani tells BAZAAR.com. "As a young girl, I would visit her seaside home in Marina di San Nicola near Rome and remember being awestruck by the beautiful, exotic items in her closet and how she effortlessly put things together. Giovanna was known for her style and uniquely independent spirit. I loved the idea of creating a collection that could reflect the elements of her closet, recreating it for modern day."   Inspired by my memory of my Great Aunt Giovanna and the admiration I've always had for her chic, effortless and collected style.  This project is the recreation of her personal wardrobe, imagined by me, through nostalgia. #thisisgiovanna A post shared by  GiOVANNA (@thisisgiovanna) on Jun 26, 2019 at 11:11am PDT Giovanna's debut collection includes a range of handwoven mules and sandals done in a mix of colors and stripes. Perfectly capturing the essence of an Italian summer getaway, the vacation-friendly footwear ranges in price from $195 to $250. While naked sandals and flip flops seem to be reigning as Summer 2019's must-have shoes, the woven mules are a pleasant disruptor to the current It shoes making the Instagram rounds.    Encompassing the spirit of Giovanna, Arslani is designing for "someone who isn‚Äôt afraid to mix things up in their closet, draws inspiration from travel, and knows that a great accessory can make an outfit."  But how does one master the art of looking just as chic as the late Great Aunt Giovanna did? Arslani explains the key, "A sense of effortlessness is important when mastering that chic Italian look for summer.  Giovanna always looked chic and put together without it seeming forced and often times that meant she would focus on one key accessory‚Äîa shoe, purse, headscarf, etc."   Though the brand's debut only includes shoes, Arslani hopes to expand into other accessory categories in the future, "I‚Äôm going to keep layering different items into the closet, adding things that I love and pulling inspiration from all aspects of my life, as long as it is something I am confident Giovanna would have worn!"   The first collection of Giovanna shoes is available to shop now at thisisgiovanna.com. 
 This will be her last VS fashion show. Adriana Lima is saying goodbye to Victoria's Secret after two decades and 18 fashion shows with the brand. The Brazilian model and VS Angel, whose name has basically become synonymous with the lingerie label, shared the news on Instagram this evening, following the first taping of the Victoria's Secret's annual fashion show. Lima, 37, is in the model lineup, but it seems this will be her last time on the VS catwalk.  She posted a video montage of her appearances in previous VS fashion shows. Her first ever was in 1999. Lima wrote a heartfelt note in the caption: "Dear Victoria, Thank you for showing me the world, sharing your secrets, and most importantly not just giving me wings but teaching me to fly. And all the ‚ù§Ô∏è to the best fans in the üåé! Love, Adriana üíñ" Lima will go out with a bang. People reports that she'll close this year's show with a dramatic winged look, while Fashionista reports there's "a whole segment of the runway spectacular" dedicated to the model.  ‚ÄúI think this year is going to be the highlight of my career,‚Äù Lima told People regarding her departure. ‚ÄúThis has been my 18th fashion show and I am still as excited as I was from the first day. I always love to be on runways and being part of the Victoria‚Äôs Secret show. [It's] my favorite to do.‚Äù Lima's exit follows that of Alessandra Ambrosio, another iconic Victoria's Secret Angel, who hung up her wings after last year's fashion show in Shanghai.  Following the 2017 VSFS, Lima said that she wanted to hit her 20-show mark before saying goodbye to Victoria's Secret. "I plan to be at 20. Two more years. Maybe more, I don‚Äôt know," Lima told People last year. "It‚Äôs nature. I‚Äôm working out, I‚Äôm being healthy, so let‚Äôs see how the body is going to turn out. But I enjoy it. So let‚Äôs say 20." Whispers of her exit swirled earlier today after model Georgia Fowler, who is walking in this year's VS fashion show, let slip that this would be Lima's final runway. "It will be her last year I think," she told Grazia. Catch Adriana's final walk when the VS fashion show airs on ABC on Sunday, December 2. Find out how to watch the broadcast here.

 Yes, you read that correctly.  Nobody asked for a live Barry Manilow performance of "Copacabana" at New York Fashion Week, but sometimes the universe sends us a blessing we didn't know we needed.  On the final day of Fall 2019 shows at NYFW, Manilow unexpectedly showed up on the Michael Kors runway to snatch wigs, take names, and sing your Aunt Carol's favorite drunk karaoke song. And it was incredible.    After a collection featuring Studio 54-inspired disco glamour, Barry joined Bella Hadid and Fran Summers to dance and sing "Copacabana" against a flashy gold backdrop. It's unclear how fashion shows have ever ended before this. In fact, every runway from here on out should end with a live Manilow performance. Designers, please take note.  2/13/19: Bella Hadid, Barry Manilow and Patti Hansen during the Michael Kors FW19 finale. #NYFW pic.twitter.com/4JDxv8csE8 Because you asked, Manilow wore an orange jacket bedazzled in rainbow jewels for his big NYFW runway debut. Likely a custom Michael Kors Collection design, the look was the cherry on top of a glitzy collection.  Was the vision of Barry performing "Copacabana" at a New York Fashion Week show completely ridiculous? Of course. But if designers are going to resort to runway gimmicks to get our attention, please let more of them spark as much joy as a surprise Barry Manilow performance. Now please excuse me while I go listen to "Copacabana" for the rest of the day.  
 Classic eyewear is the key to rocking throwback style in 2017 There's a palpable '90s spirit in the air. Part of what makes the decade so ripe for revival is it didn't tap into just one look. Stripped-down minimalism, rebellious grunge, and all-out glamour are some of the distinct fashion moments from that era to stand the test of time. Another thing that never goes out of style? Outfit-making glasses. Oliver Peoples has been handcrafting classic eyewear for the past three decades, with some of its most iconic styles popularized by celebrities in the '90s. In honor of the brand's 30th anniversary, we're showing you how to rock five major '90s trends in 2017‚Äïand the best glasses to wear with them.      If there's one silhouette that defined the '90s, it's the bias-cut slip dress. Streamlined and curve-skimming, a slinky slip is the perfect thing to wear when you'd rather be naked. Keep things simple with barely-there makeup and clear heels, but introduce a bit of personality in the form of pointdexter glasses that add a nerdy-chic touch. The Eyewear: Oliver Peoples O'Malley Rx SHOP Protagonist Classic Slip, for similar styles visit protagonist.com; Manolo Blahnik Scolto PVC & Suede Mules, barneys.com Pared-back minimalism may have ruled in the '90s, but the decade is equally known for its moments of fashionable excess. Think: sexy satin shirts buttoned down to there, velvet hip huggers, slick latex dresses‚Äïall of which are relevant today. Texture is key. A glossy patent skirt gives off just the right amount of vixen, while come-as-you-are curls and timeless tortoiseshell shades complete the look.  The Eyewear: Oliver Peoples MP-3 30th SHOP Are You Am I Kimia Bodysuit, areyouami.com; Tom Ford Patent Leather Side-Zip Skirt, tomford.com Our collective obsession with millenial pink is nothing new. Iridescent pastel makeup was a major phenomenon for '90s pop stars, who piled on shimmery eye shadow and frosted lipstick. Bring the look into 2017 by doubling down on one color‚Äïlike powder pink‚Äïand don't forget to coordinate your eyewear with ros√©-tinted aviators. The Eyewear: Oliver Peoples Rockmore SHOP Brora Cashmere Long Sleeved Crop Cardigan, brorausa.com Inspired by the middle-finger-to-the-world musicians who emerged from the Seattle scene in the early '90s, fashion designers put ripped flannels and combat boots on the runways, and the rest is history. These days, we're feeling more of a subtle, refined take on classic grunge references. A deconstructed, homespun skirt and shrunken sweater channel that rule-breaker attitude‚Äï while a killer pair of sepia-stained shades pulls it all together.

 Each woman styled the print of the season differently.  Emerging as one of fall's hottest trends, gray checked suiting separates have taken over everywhere from the street style scene to the A-list to Instagram (if you haven't seen at least 5 bloggers wearing a gray plaid blazer, you may want to consult your optometrist for an eye exam). The latest to test-drive the look is none other than Blake Lively, who opted for a gray checked Ralph Lauren suit yesterday during one of her seven outfit changes.  But the actress wasn't the first to step out in Ralph Lauren's Spring 2018 menswear-inspired suit. Back in September, First Lady Melania Trump wore the same double-breasted suit to hear her husband speak at the United Nations‚Äîmaking for an unexpected twinning moment.  Proving the versatility of this season's ubiquitous suit trend, Lively fully committed to the menswear-inspired look, leaving her blazer buttoned up with a matching overcoat draped on top, and accessorizing with lace-up boots, a briefcase-like Michael Kors bag, a black tie, and pocket squares. FLOTUS, meanwhile, went for a more relaxed take with her jacket unbuttoned, revealing a black blouse underneath.  The power of the power suit, indeed. 
 The show brought Mr. Valentino himself to tears.  Yesterday, on the last day of Paris Couture Week, Valentino staged a runway show reminding us all the power of dreamy, breathtaking couture gowns fit for a fashion fantasy. Featuring an astounding 63 looks, the collection designed by creative director Pierpaolo Piccioli was enough to garner a standing ovation and bring Mr. Valentino himself, who sat front row, to tears. From sweeping gowns in bold colors to ornate floral headpieces and embroidered detailing, each look was more stunning than the last. But it was Kaia Gerber's larger-than-life hair paired with a pink feathered ballgown that really stole the show.  The 16-year-old model (and daughter of supermodel Cindy Crawford) dropped jaws as she hit the runway rocking the most major hair by legendary hairstylist Guido Palau. The dramatic style, which was inspired by Diana Vreeland's 1960s Harper's BAZAAR shoots with Richard Avedon, made for the perfect top off to an already wonderfully dramatic collection.  Along with the oversized hair moment, the runway also featured several models wearing beautiful handmade flower headpieces with their couture gowns.  An intricate, cape-clad silk gown that opened the show reportedly took 1,120 hours to make on its own‚Äîillustrating the level of detailing and time Piccioli's latest collection for the fashion house took to make.   ‚ÄúSogno ad alta voce‚Äù, cape with ‚ÄòL√©da et le Cygne‚Äô and ‚ÄòNarcisse‚Äô embroidered onto it. Peau de soie, mikado, faille and lurex intarsia with shades of celadon blue and fruit√© red. Light blue wool combination. The first look of the #ValentinoHauteCouture #FallWinter1819 Collection designed by @pppiccioli A post shared by  Valentino (@maisonvalentino) on Jul 5, 2018 at 1:12am PDT And that was only the beginning of a series of gowns serving as the ultimate form of fashion escapism. See more of the swoon-worthy couture gowns, guaranteed to take your breath away, below.  Closing the show was model Adut Akech Bior in a striking marigold gown complete with a matching floral headpiece. It was the perfect end to a truly dream-worthy collection. 
 The model announces she won't be going to Shanghai anymore.  Set to take place in Shanghai, China, this year's Victoria's Secret Fashion Show is less than one week away, but the highly-anticipated runway just lost one major supermodel.  Following rumors of models having issues getting visas approved for the show, Gigi Hadid announced today that she will no longer be walking the runway this year. The model took to Twitter to share the news, writing, "I‚Äôm so bummed I won‚Äôt be able to make it to China this year. Love my VS family, and will be with all my girls in spirit!! Can't wait to tune in with everyone to see the beautiful show I know it will be, and already can't wait for next year!" Though Hadid didn't offer a reason for her abrupt decision to skip the show, there is speculation that she was amongst the models experiencing issues obtaining a Chinese visa. When it was first announced she would be walking the show in Shanghai, the hashtag "#GigiGetOutOfChina" began trending on Twitter following backlash over a video in which she appeared to be mocking Asian facial features.  After coming under fire for the video, the model issued an apology on China's social media platform, Weibo. It's unclear whether backlash following the video is in any way connected to the model's absence from this year's VS Fashion Show.  Gigi's younger sister Bella, however, appears to still be walking in Shanghai. The model posted on her Instagram Story today, "Coming for you @victoriassecret!!" leading fans to think she's already en route to Shanghai. BAZAAR.com reached out to Victoria's Secret for comment and will update this space with any statement from the brand. 
 This leopard number is by cult favorite designer Ruslan Baginskiy... The bucket hat trend is at fever pitch. Fashion month brought a steady stream of Fendi, Prada, Gucci and any number of unnamed buckets on the heads of oft-photographed influencers. It's the early 2000s all over again and we're here for it. Gigi Hadid is also here for it. The mega-model posted recent selfies on Instagram in a fetching leopard bucket hat with the caption "apres ski week"‚Äîskipping the more winter-friendly and expected knit cap. She'd previously donned the printed chapeau while dancing on Insta stories in a ski lodge alongside Olivia Culpo and Taylor LaShae.  The creator of the hat in question is cult favorite Ruslan Baginskiy, better known for his baker boy caps and boaters that have graced the domes of such luminaries of Bella Hadid, Romee Strijd, Madonna, Zoe Kravitz and more.  "Ruslan was inspired by an 2000s aesthetic. Gigi was singing and dancing to Britney‚Äôs and Justin‚Äôs songs [on Instagram], which we also like," a rep for the brand tells BAZAAR.com. "Ruslan and all his team do the same after two glasses of champagne. 2000s fashion trends are returning, both in fashion and music, that‚Äôs why we made the leopard print bucket hat and we are happy that Gigi feels the same." Old Britney Spears, Justin Timberlake, and bucket hats‚Äîthree things we can all get behind. Gigi's leopard print bucket hat won't be available for a few months (it's part of the designer's upcoming fall collection), but thankfully, he's been on the forefront of the trend for some time.

 Paris Fashion Week was graced with a new model today.  When it comes to avant-garde runway fashion, Thom Browne always delivers‚Äîand today's Spring 2018 collection was no exception. After moving his show from New York to Paris Fashion Week, the designer made his debut in the French capital with a splash‚Äîand a giant white lace unicorn.  Set to the tune of The Little Mermaid's "Part of Your World," the show began with two models walking the runway in misshapen embellished body suits and bubble helmets.  What then followed was a collection filled with an array of colors, silhouettes, and even a skeleton dress.  But it was the finale brigade that really stole the show. A model wearing a sheer bubble helmet and a white feathered and lace look led a larger-than-life white lace unicorn down the runway. The unicorn, guided by two male models in matching white lace looks, glided the Parisian catwalk in a moment that left attendees completely surprised.

 We're moving into a post-home button world. As the world gears up for the release of the new iPhone 8, experts are finally letting us in on what radical changes we should expect from the company's latest attempt at creating a game-changing handset. The iPhone 8 ditches the much-loved home button, something we've been accustomed to for 7 generations of iPhone. And, with an all-glass bezel-less design (remember the horrors of smashing your iPhone 4? Yes, that's back), experts are worried Apple may have pushed away its loyal fandom.  Mark Gurman, Bloomberg's tech expert explained the highly anticipated changes: "Across the bottom of the screen there's a thin, software bar in lieu of the home button. A user can drag it up to the middle of the screen to open the phone. When inside an app, a similar gesture starts multitasking. From here, users can continue to flick upwards to close the app and go back to the home screen. An animation in testing sucks the app back into its icon."   And that's not all. Apple has given the iPhone 8 a very futuristic update with facial recognition, on such a level that the iPhone "knows it's you‚Ä¶and will unlock with the swipe of a thumb." Only time will tell how user-friendly Apple's new updates will be. But, if Samsung can do it (who happen to supply the iPhone 8's OLED screen), Apple is sure to make a good crack at it too.  Oh, and there's no sign of the headphone jack coming back. Sorry.

 Designer Brian Atwood previews the killer heels on BAZAAR.com.  The Victoria's Secret Fashion Show looks go beyond just the wings and the lingerie; there are some epic heels involved, too. For the fourth year in the row, footwear designer Brian Atwood teamed up with the mega intimates brand to create the shoes for the runway extravaganza. The result is 100 different pairs of shoes in 18 different styles.  Ahead, take a look at bold and dazzling heels the Angels and models will be wearing down the catwalk.  To catch the shoes with their full runway looks, be on the lookout for photos from the NYC taping later today, and catch the full broadcast of the show on Sunday, December on ABC.  One of the styles is a T-strap sandal featuring a multicolored floral pattern with a black heel and ankle strap. We may be nearing winter, but these heels make us want to take our spring and summer wardrobes out of storage again.  ‚ÄúI love that Victoria‚Äôs Secret allows you to be free to design and create ‚Äòover the top‚Äô styles for the fashion show,‚Äù Atwood tells BAZAAR.com. ‚ÄúThis show is the ultimate fashion show for shoes!‚Äù In addition to the rosy red and blush pink iterations of the sandal, there's also this blue-and-green combo, for a cooler color scheme. And there's this pink and periwinkle colorway for pastel lovers. Next is a series of satin cage heels, which come in solid fuchsia, neon yellow, and black. These electric-hued pairs likely won't be hard to spot on the runway.  "The VS show has multiple stories [and] themes throughout, and we design into those themes and create what we think will be a ‚Äòwow‚Äô factor," Atwood tells BAZAAR.com. We wonder what theme these killer heels will be a part of on the runway. And because no fall ensemble is quite complete without a bootie, VS models will also be rocking these vibrant ankle boots on the catwalk.  Shop a similar style The stiletto, pointed-toe pairs are covered with in-your-face florals, which you can also find in the Mary Katrantzou x Victoria's Secret capsule collection. We can already imagine this fur- and feather-covered cage sandal on a fun, carefree bride. Who wouldn't want to say "I do" in a heels like these? The shoe comes in a champagne and a pink-hued style.  In the vein of its PINK collegiate line, VS shows off its sporty side with these black-and-white booties, covered in logo-printed bands.   Another athletic-inspired style includes a lace-up design, leather lining, and a white elastic panel down the side. Equal parts sporty and witchy.  There are more abstract versions of the ankle boot too. These include cut-outs and a thick ankle strap, with metallic floral embroidery stretching all the way down to the tip of the stiletto.   "It usually takes around four to six months from initial concept to final product," Atwood says of creating the footwear. "It all depends on the complexity of the design. Some shoes have over 3,000 crystals on them and over 100 hours of work." We can also expect to see this black leather lace-up bootie, complete with a stiletto heel and tasseled laces that wrap around the ankle. The boot also got a thigh-high upgrade, resulting in an extra-vampy look. We can already picture these on the catwalk with matching lace-up lingerie and perhaps a pair of black wings. Shop a similar style Angels go grunge with this patent leather over-the-knee boot, featuring a pointed heel, a plaid cuff, and two buckles for an edgy feel.
 It was the NYFW treat we all deserve.  On Day 5 of New York Fashion Week, Lela Rose gave us the greatest gift of all: a full-on dog show on the runway. To present her Fall 2019 collection, the designer enlisted the most precious cast of furry models for the "Roseminster Dog Show." The end result was just as cute as you'd expect. Each model walked the "runway" with a dog in tow as announcers Robert Verdi and Jenna Bush Hager moderated the show. Show categories included groups like "Lassies Who Lunch" and "Cocktail Companion Group."  For the most part, the Fall 2019 looks complemented the dogs that accompanied them down the runway. A standard poodle was paired with an elegant black and white cocktail dress, a corgi with a plaid, Brit-inspired coat dress, a golden retriever with a floral prairie dress.   Much of the collection itself was inspired by dogs, too. There were dresses and suits featuring a black and white dog print that was surprisingly chic and an oversized camel coat emblazoned with the subtle print of tiny greyhound dog silhouettes. "The inspiration for this collection struck when I happened upon an antique dog cameo button, but my four-legged friends have long been a lovable influence,‚Äù Rose wrote in the show notes.     But along with staging an adorable dog show, the collection will also give back to animals in need. The brand announced a portion of proceeds from its Fall 2019 pieces will be donated to the ASPCA.    A dog show and a fashion show all in one? This is the New York Fashion Week we all deserve.

 Biggie Biggie Biggie can't you see... Versace is bringing Notorious B.I.G.'s signature sunglasses out of the archives. The late, great rapper died more than 20 years ago, but his stylish legacy lives on. Beginning today, you'll be able to cop a pair of the rapper's iconic shades in an updated frame style, with the same gold medusa design on the side.  The glasses are available exclusively at Barney's stores and Barneys.com for one month, before going on sale at additional retailers. The highly recognizable sunnies, which Biggie rarely took off, and often rapped about, retail for $295.  You'd be hard pressed to find an image of the Bed-Stuy-born rapper without the black sunglasses, which he donned in press interviews, on stage and beyond.  He even rocks the frames in his music video for hit song "Hypnotize" in 1997, where he sings "Miami, D.C. prefer Versace."  Biggie and Donatella Versace had a close relationship. The designer credits him for helping to spread the world about the Italian brand. "I think Biggie was amazing. He came to my shows in Paris many times, and we'd see each other often," Donatella told Fader in 2011. "He always used to talk so nicely about my family. I think he was so smart, so intelligent. He had such a mind. So I loved what he was doing and how he was giving people a way to know about Versace‚ÄîI do think he was giving people a way to know about Versace‚ÄîI do think a lot of people started to know about Versace because of him."  Biggie was one of the first hip-hop stars to regularly attend Versace‚Äôs runway fashion shows. It's not uncommon to see hip hop artists front row everywhere from Gucci to Vuitton now, but like so many trends in fashion and music‚Äîit all goes back to the Notorious B.I.G. 
 The model duo just took their friendship to a stylish new level. Kendall Jenner and Kaia Gerber have us seeing double. The models had a casual twinning moment while shopping in LA today, both sporting cropped tank tops, high-waisted pants, sneakers, and sunnies.  But even while rocking matching outfits, their personal styles shone through. Gerber channeled the '90s with a bucket hat, thick hoop earrings, tinted sunglasses, cutoff jeans, and Chucks. Meanwhile, Jenner was equal parts sexy and chic in a cutoff white tank top that teased some underboob, dark slacks with a string belt, a Louis Vuitton handbag, white sneakers, and wire frame shades. Proof that model-off-duty style is better in twos:   Gerber, 16, recently joined Jenner, 22, during fashion month when she made her runway debut this September. The two walked for designers like Alexander Wang, Marc Jacobs, Fendi, and Versace together. But the model pair started working together even before Kaia set foot on the catwalk. Last summer, Jenner made her photography debut for LOVE Magazine and shot a 14-year-old Gerber for the glossy.   me by kendall for @thelovemagazine A post shared by  Kaia (@kaiagerber) on Jul 19, 2016 at 8:50am PDT Gerber doesn't take her time with Jenner for granted. The up-and-comer has opened up about being a fan of the It Girl and consulting her for modeling advice. "I think [Kendall] does a really good job about having a life outside of [work] and staying with your friends and not separating yourself too much, so I've just kind of learned that from her," she told E!. Even her famous mom, Cindy Crawford, revealed that Gerber "loves Kendall Jenner" back in 2015. The admiration is mutual. Jenner praised Gerber for being "such a great young girl with such a good head on her shoulders," when she photographed her for LOVE. "You could say I‚Äôm a fan of hers, and I would love to see her succeed," she told the mag.  She's also aware that Gerber's on track to be the next supermodel. "Listen, were all trying to get all our work in now before she hits the scene," Jenner joked. "When that happens we'll all go broke!"
 You can finally shop Bey's Balmain Coachella looks.  Although it feels like forever in the never-ending news cycle that is 2018, it wasn't that long ago when Beyonc√© transformed Coachella into Beychella with a truly epic two-hour performance. (In case you need a reminder, or just 15 minutes of pure joy, re-live the intro in all its glory below.) Making history as the first black woman to headline the California music festival, Bey used the opportunity to celebrate the culture of historically black colleges with her performance. To do so, she hit the stage in several custom college letter sweatshirts designed by Balmain. Immediately after, fans desperately searched the internet for ways to get their hands on a BAK-lettered sweatshirt. And now, we can all finally buy one.    Joining forces once again, Beyonc√© and Balmain collaborated on a capsule collection of the college letter sweatshirts and T-shirts the singer wore on stage at Coachella. The six-piece collection features three T-shirts and three sweatshirts offered in black, hot pink, and bright yellow, like the one Bey wore to open her Coachella set.    But there's more to the collection than just copying Bey's on-stage look. Proceeds from the pieces will go towards the United Negro College Fund, following Beyonc√©‚Äôs $100,000 donation to four historically black colleges after her Coachella set. In a statement, Balmain creative director Olivier Rousteing explained the significance behind he and Beyonc√©'s limited-edition collection:  The Beyonc√© x Balmain collection, which ranges from $290 - $1,790, will be available exclusively at Balmain's Paris flagship store on July 13 and then available online and in select retailers starting July 14.

 Dior released its new collection of saddle bags today.  In case you somehow missed the bevy of influencers toting their Dior saddle bags on Instagram this morning, the iconic bag is officially back and available to shop starting today.   Carried by everyone from Paris Hilton to Carrie Bradshaw, the distinctly-shaped bag largely defined the fashion of the early aughts. And if you weren't lucky enough to wear the bag back in 2000, now's your chance. After slowly popping up (and selling out) on resale sites like The Real Real and Vestiaire Collective, Maria Grazia Chiuri reintroduced the Dior saddle bag on the Fall 2018 runway in newly-imagined iterations like sleek all-black leather, '60s-inspired patchwork, and of course, the logo version that ruled the 2000s.  And now, starting today, the Fall 2018 bags are finally available to shop in stores. The new crop of bags come in a range of styles and are offered in two sizes: a mini and a large (so if the ultra-tiny original versions were too small to fit all your belongings, you're in luck). Prices range from $2,350 to $8,500.  "I consider this icon of the house's recent history the perfect accessory to deal with this battle that is daily life. Indeed, the saddle bag is a bag that is worn in exactly the same way as a shirt or jacket, and it‚Äôs so comfortable to wear with its long strap that you almost forget it‚Äôs there," Maria Grazia Chiuri said in a statement from the brand.   See the full new collection of Dior saddle bags below. 
 Jaw-dropping good.  It was 2007 when Christian Siriano first made his public debut as a contestant (and later, a winner) on Bravo's Project Runway. Since then, the designer has gone on to successfully build his own fashion house‚Äîwhich has blossomed into one of the most inclusive, body positive brands in the industry.  To celebrate the 10 year anniversary of his eponymous brand, Siriano hosted a special show for his Fall 2018 collection today at New York Fashion Week. Featuring a whopping 72 looks, the designer's anniversary show was a breathtaking ode to diversity in fashion‚Äîfilled with an array of show-stopping, Oscar-worthy gowns. Ashley Graham opened the show in a red monochromatic look featuring a plush floor-length coat and red leather over-the-knee boots.  Standing out most amongst the lineup of models was the fact that Siriano also cast celebrities to walk in the show. Actresses Danielle Brooks and Selma Blair made their big debuts on the catwalk. Blair wore a nude bodysuit adorned with cursive writings and a merlot fur stole draped across her body.  Brooks, meanwhile, made a grand runway debut showing off her ethereal blue gown with the fiercest walk and poses.  But the celeb power extended well beyond the runway and into the star-studded front row that included Whoopi Goldberg, Laverne Cox, Meg Ryan, Molly Shannon, Coco Rocha, and more.  As for the collection itself, the 72 looks comprised of dramatic tulle ballgowns, sexy patent leather, sparkling crystal-encrusted dresses, unexpected headpieces, and so much more. It was the kind of collection that needs to be seen in motion in order to get the full jaw-dropping effect, as demonstrated in the below videos:    I covered The Cranberries‚Äô ‚ÄúDreams‚Äù for the finale of @CSiriano‚Äôs 10th anniversary #NYFW show! It‚Äôs available now on iTunes. Video by @nicolettemason pic.twitter.com/IT7mMGZD6x   How to make an exit @csiriano style. ‚ú® A post shared by  Tyler McCall (@eiffeltyler) on Feb 10, 2018 at 2:28pm PST Though more and more designers are slowly moving towards more diverse runways including more women of color and plus-size models, Siriano was one of the designers who helped pioneer showcasing all body sizes and shapes on the runway. Today's stunning anniversary show was a reminder of that while also making it clearer than ever that Siriano is way more than just a Project Runway winner. 
 The actress debuted her baby bump in a stunning portrait for the brand.  Back in December, it was rumored, but never officially confirmed, that Kirsten Dunst was expecting her first child with fianc√© Jesse Plemons. Today, the actress confirmed the news by debuting her baby bump in Rodarte's Fall 2018 portrait series.  Setting the bar high for original pregnancy announcement ideas (you won't find this one on Pinterest), Dunst cradled her baby bump in two stunning photos showcasing Rodarte's latest collection. The actress stars in the fashion house's new portrait series, which features a star-studded lineup also including Rowan Blanchard, Gia Coppola, Tessa Thompson, Grimes, the modeling debut of Ava Philippe, and more. Considering Dunst has been both a muse and a friend to Rodarte designers Laura and Kate Mulleavy for years, it makes for a fitting (and fashionable) choice for her big announcement.  In her first portrait, an expecting Dunst wears a pink, red, and white floral embroidered gown with a red and silver dotted tulle dress.    For the second image, the actress wears a tan coat with a brown bow tied around the neckline.  The child will be the first for both Kirsten and her fianc√© Jesse Plemons. The couple announced their engagement in January 2017.  But Dunst's special announcement isn't the only news-worthy moment featured in Rodarte's Fall 2018 lookbook. The series of portraits also marks the fashion modeling debut of Ava Philippe, the 18-year-old daughter of Reese Witherspoon and Ryan Philippe. The teenager, who's the spitting image of her mom, wears a pink tulle gown adorned with red flowers and lace gloves.  See more of Rodarte's Fall 2018 portraits below: Chloe and Halle Bailey: Grimes: Rowan Blanchard: Tessa Thompson: Gia Coppola: Danai Gurira: Hong Chau:
 It's called chic in the heat...  The temps are rising, but the ladies at couture continue to bring the style. See who's bringing all the style off the couture runways. Couture is nothing if not a place to take a risk and wear a very fancy eye patch. When in doubt, match your dress to your hair, darling. A good lace dress is always in style.  A black off-the-shoulder top is a true summer staple. From a printed dress, to interesting shoes, and a statement hat, this is a lot of look and she wears it well. A little Dior saddle bag goes a long way. Life is better in black and white plaid and a bucket hat. Are you sensing a theme? The time is right for a good topper. It's the season of baggy jeans, get on board. The edict, keep it simple, applies perfectly here. This blogger goes full "New Look" in Dior. Try different variations on one shade to really make a look come alive.  A good white jumpsuit will solve all your summer quandaries. It's a good day when you can match your sports car to your dress. White, ruffles, and volume make for an ideal summer statement. Giambattista Valli has a bold dress silhouette dialed in. An oversized jacket for the win. A little leather in the heat didn't scare off this show-goer. We love a good turtleneck dress. A menswear inspired suit looks nothing short of smart. The fashion director of Garage knows how to mix her bold blues.  A paperbag pant and a tank are perfect for those long summer days. All good friends coordinate on occasion. We're here for a truly bold shoulder. A simple shirt dress answers so many sartorial questions. A belted dress never fails to flatter. We love a '90s vibe of a button-down undone from the bottom.

 The brand is introducing new policies to better educate and diversify its staff. Update, 2/26: Following backlash against a "noose hoodie" design on its Fall 2019 runway, Burberry is announcing new diversity initiatives within the company.  After issuing a formal apology and removing the offensive designs from the collection, the fashion house took to Instagram to share new company programs to prevent future issues with racism. "We are determined to learn from this and have spoken with our employees, experts and communities we impacted, we have developed a plan to increase our consciousness and understanding of social issues and fully embrace diversity and inclusion," Marco Gobbetti, CEO of Burberry Group, said in a statement.  The three new overarching initiatives are as follows:   These steps include:  1. Increasing our understanding We will strengthen our understanding of and sensitivity to a range of perspectives to help us live the values we hold and be truly inclusive. We will: . ‚Ä¢ Introduce additional training for all employees, including senior management ‚Ä¢ Establish employee councils focused on diversity and inclusion ‚Ä¢ Assemble an advisory board of external experts 2. Diversifying the pipeline of talent We will evolve our pipeline of talent to ensure we better reflect the world we live in and build a more diverse talent base for the future. We will: . ‚Ä¢ Strengthen goals to ensure diverse representation in our employee base ‚Ä¢ Expand our creative arts scholarship internationally to support students from diverse backgrounds and provide full-time employment for 50 graduates from the programme over the next five years ‚Ä¢ Extend internationally Burberry Inspire, our in-school arts and culture programme designed to help young people overcome challenging circumstances and see future opportunity in the creative industries 3. Championing those who help others We will add to our support of organisations promoting diversity and inclusion and providing assistance to people in crisis, including the Samaritans, who offer a safe, confidential place to which people can turn A post shared by  Burberry (@burberry) on Feb 26, 2019 at 8:00am PST The brand will introduce several programs to support each overarching initiative and educate its employees on sensitive social and race issues.  Update, 2/22: Days after Burberry apologized for sending an offensive "noose hoodie" down the runway, its creative director Riccardo Tisci is speaking out too. Tisci took to Instagram to issue a heartfelt formal apology for the Fall 2019 collection piece.  "I'm deeply sorry to anyone whose feelings I unintentionally have hurt. I am a man of my principles and I take my responsibilities seriously. I am committed to learn from this so that this never happens again," Tisci wrote.  I‚Äôd like to express myself following my recent show. First of all, I‚Äòm deeply sorry to anyone whose feelings I unintentionally have hurt. I am a man of my principles and I take my responsibilities seriously. I am committed to learn from this so that this never happens again.  Those who know me well or who know my work will understand that any references I have used in my collections have never been driven by negativity. This is not at my core. I take inspirations from life as I love it, in all of its beautiful forms. This collection was born from a very positive place. Throughout my life I have always fought for diversity, for sexuality, for people of colour, for women‚Äôs rights, for all genders, and for inclusivity. And I consider myself a world citizen and I‚Äôve been raised in a loving family who taught me how to love and respect everyone around me. I listen, I learn, I improve and I believe in the power of love. A post shared by  Riccardo Tisci (@riccardotisci17) on Feb 22, 2019 at 9:21am PST In his post, Tisci claimed the design was not meant to be offensive or negative, "Those who know me well or who know my work will understand that any references I have used in my collections have never been driven by negativity. This is not at my core. I take inspirations from life as I love it, in all of its beautiful forms. This collection was born from a very positive place. Throughout my life I have always fought for diversity, for sexuality, for people of colour, for women‚Äôs rights, for all genders, and for inclusivity. And I consider myself a world citizen and I‚Äôve been raised in a loving family who taught me how to love and respect everyone around me."The creative director concluded by saying, "I listen, I learn, I improve and I believe in the power of love." Original Article, 2/19: Burberry is coming under fire after sending a "noose hoodie" down its Fall 2019 runway at London Fashion Week. The brand, along with its creative director Riccardo Tisci, is now apologizing for the deeply disturbing piece and removing it from the collection.  Model Liz Kennedy first called out the problematic sweatshirt on Instagram after voicing criticism of the piece backstage at the show. "Suicide is not fashion. It is not glamorous nor edgy," she wrote before revealing her concerns were dismissed at the show.  "How could anyone overlook this and think it would be okay to do this especially in a line dedicated to young girls and youth," Kennedy continued on Instagram, "Let‚Äôs not forget about the horrifying history of lynching either. There are hundreds of ways to tie a rope and they chose to tie it like a noose completely ignoring the fact that it was hanging around a neck."  "I had asked to speak to someone about it but the only thing I was told to do was to write a letter. I had a brief conversation with someone but all that it entailed was 'it‚Äôs fashion. Nobody cares about what‚Äôs going on in your personal life so just keep it to yourself,'" Kennedy added.  The model also claims that staff were joking about the sweatshirt in the dressing room before the show, hanging a noose from the ceiling. After the piece caused major backlash online, her remarks led to an apology from the brand's CEO and creative director. In a statement released to CNN, Marco Gobbetti, chief executive officer, said:   Riccardo Tisci, the brand's creative director, also apologized, "I am so deeply sorry for the distress that has been caused as a result of one of the pieces in my show on Sunday." The piece will also be removed from the collection.  Burberry's offensive design comes just one week after Gucci received backlash for a turtleneck resembling blackface. The brand immediately issued an apology, pulled the product, and announced several initatives to increase diversity throughout the company.  Dapper Dan, a frequent collaborator of Gucci, spoke out about the brand's mistake on Instagram. He revealed Gucci's CEO, Marco Bizzarri, personally flew from Italy to meet with Dan and other community members in Harlem to discuss the issue. The meeting ended with plans to launch several diversity programs throughout the fashion house, including global and regional directors for diversity and inclusion, a diversity and inclusivity awareness program, and a multicultural design scholarship program. A post shared by Dapper Dan (@dapperdanharlem) on Feb 15, 2019 at 10:22am PST With brands continually making "mistakes" in terms of race, what will it take for designers to finally start educating themselves on issues of racism and diversity in the year 2019?

 The collaboration made its runway debut in New York last night.   With just a few weeks left until Moschino x H&M hits stores, the collaboration made its runway debut last night with an all-star model lineup in New York.  The show, which saw Joan Smalls, Winnie Harlow, Candice Swanepoel, and all three Hadid siblings hit the runway, was opened by Gigi Hadid and closed by none other than Naomi Campbell. The iconic super served as the finale look in a sparkling silver mini dress, layered chain necklaces, and over-the-knee boots.  Meanwhile, Gigi Hadid opened the show in a hoodie sweatshirt dress topped off with a gold puffer, over-the-knee boots, and an abundance of gold jewelry.  Making it a Hadid family affair, Anwar and Bella Hadid also graced the runway, with Bella wearing a sexy black leather dress from the collection.  Much like the runway casting, the collection was diverse. As first revealed in the look book, the Moschino x H&M collab offers up a range of influences from MTV to Disney, hip hop culture, and over-the-top bling‚Äîall of which feel true to Moschino's signature aesthetic. There were black and gold chain ensembles, logo sweatshirts, and colorful faux fur coats‚Äîmaking for an eclectic hodgepodge of runway looks.  As for the show itself, Jeremy Scott transformed the venue into its own Times Square-esque setting complete with billboards, flashing lights, and street carts serving New York classics like hot dogs, falafel, and giant soft pretzels. For the Italian fashion brand, it was a way to fully invest in the New York scene‚Äîeven if it was the touristy version.  The full Moschino x H&M collection hits stores and hm.com on November 8.

 Is this alien-like trend the future of fashion? There once was a time when we dubbed smartwatches and fitness trackers "the future of fashion," but A. Human, an upcoming body modification exhibit, is here to take things to a whole new level with fashion implants.  Kim Kardashian West and Chrissy Teigen were amongst the first to wear the alien-like body modification accessories, which appear to be implanted into their skin. Yesterday, Kim took to Instagram Stories to show off a choker necklace that moves in sync with her heartbeat.    Chrissy Teigen, meanwhile, went for an entirely different piece of intricate body artwork resembling skin-like feathers across her chest.  A. Human also enlisted model Andreja Pejic as well as Queer Eye's Tan France to debut additional body modification pieces including shoulder horns (√† la Nicola Formichetti x Lady Gaga) and a ruffled Tudor collar.   @ahuman Pinnacle SS19 by Nicola Formichetti coming soon. üì∏ @louiebanksshoots #ahuman A post shared by  Andreja Pejic (@andrejapejic) on Aug 27, 2018 at 6:05am PDT  You guys!!!

The interactive experience was conceptualized by longtime Kardashian friend Simon Huck and explores fashion as a reimagined part of your body, rather than something you simply put on.

 The British designer worked with his long-time design partner, Christopher De Vos, on the royal wedding look. Princess Eugenie arrived to her wedding at Windsor Castle in one of the most innovative and sophisticated royal bridal designs in history‚Äìby a British designer you wouldn't expect. While speculation mounted leading up to the wedding that Erdem, Vivienne Westwood, or Stella McCartney would design Princess Eugenie's gown, the royal bride opted for a collaboration with Peter Pilotto and Christopher De Vos for her walk down the aisle. The two British designers founded the label Peter Pilotto in 2007. Per the Palace, "the brand is known for its innovative textile design, paired with a modern feminine silhouette." The Princess of York met the two designers when she was co-hosting an event for female artists, and she has been wearing designs by the brand ever since. Per Eugenie's pre-wedding remarks, her dress was made by a "British-based design house," but like Meghan Markle, the designers are not British. Pilotto holds Austrian and Italian citizenship, while De Vos is Belgian and Peruvian. Per the official statement on Eugenie's wedding fashion, the bride worked with Pilotto and De Vos closely on the design of her wedding gown, and "the designers undertook archive research into previous dresses worn by Members of the Royal Family and identified a silhouette." The research, it seems, paid off in spades.  Per Business of Fashion, who placed De Vos and Pilotto on their BOF 500, the brand first came on the scene in 2007, focusing on digital printing and color play. The label immediately caught the attention of retailers, and is now sold in stores like Net-a-Porter, Dover Street Market, Saks Fifth Avenue, and Liberty. Initially founded by Peter Pilotto, De Vos joined the brand in its early years, and the two now work together out of their East London studio. The designers met while studying at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp, and received the Swarovski Emerging Talent Award in 2010.  The designers used their fabric development skills to craft a custom silk jacquard for Princess Eugenie's gown, using an intricate weaving technique. Per the Palace statement about the details of Eugenie's wedding dress, the fabric included subtle symbols of the "Thistle for Scotland, acknowledging the couple's fondness for Balmoral, a Shamrock for Ireland as a nod to the Bride's Ferguson family, the York Rose and ivy representing the couple's home." The symbols were designed in a garland of rope-like motifs, and woven into a jacquard of silk, cotton and viscose blend, and then translated into a jacquard weave in the Como region of Italy.  While eveningwear, grand gowns, custom bridal, and royal dressing don't immediately come to mind when thinking of Peter Pilotto and Christopher De Vos, that is surely about to change. 
 RIP, me...  New Year, new way to look better than everyone else at the party.  Shop 12 holiday ideas that are nothing short of inspired.  Take a break from your go-to hues in favor of something surprising, like Kendall Jenner in marigold. This statement-making dress will put all of that red velvet to shame. To shame! From an embellished sweater with denim for a casual holiday look, a killer white suit and a black dress with cut-outs, Kate Bosworth just solved all of your New Year's look dilemmas. And convinced us that a little bag is where it's at. A top handle bag with pearls is just the sort of special piece that will take your go-to dress from nice to extravagant.¬† Don't wait for spring to get your nautical vibes on, a good stripe is a fabulous option for any New Year's fete.  This season-less stunner is just the thing to ring in the New Year, and then wear for date night come spring. Right now is all about a bold top that signals a 1980s comeback‚Äîwhether on a gown like Gigi or a statement blouse. This dress packs a punch while still remaining approachable and chic. A skirt that helps ring in the New Year should come with some shine and really know how to make an entrance. Like we said, find a skirt that knows how to work the room. A top with volume, done up in all-black feels very of-the-moment. Each of these pieces‚Äîon Emily Ratajkowski‚Äî are simple, yet impactful.  Ladies who like to show it off can pair this with wide-leg trousers or a full skirt, while the more subdued among us will look fantastic with it layered under a blouse or tee.¬† You can never go wrong with a fitted skirt suit, but it's these bold pink shoes that bring this stellar ensemble into holiday territory. A little pink and a lot of crystals are just what 2019 ordered. A beret can really bring a standard look into stellar territory. Whether you opt for a beret or a baker boy, a lightened up topper will take your whole look next-level. A mini dress with major boots‚Äîseen here on Laura Harrier at Louis Vuitton‚Äîis always a winning combo. A dress that will have everyone who overthought it desperate for a simpler, cooler life.
 She was 59 years old.  Cuban-American fashion designer Isabel Toledo has passed away at the age of 59, The New York Times reported. According to her husband, Ruben Toledo, her partner since high school, the cause of death was breast cancer. Unlike her American designer contemporaries, Isabel stayed out of the spotlight, considering herself more of an "engineer" of clothing instead of a "fashion person," according to the Times' report. However, she made headlines when former First Lady Michelle Obama wore her lemon-yellow dress and coat for the 2009 inauguration parade.  The designer called the moment an "amazing honor," per ABC News. The gravity of Barack Obama's Inauguration Day was not lost on her; she chose a bright lemongrass hue for Michelle's look because it was "optimistic, a color that represented change." Before Inauguration Day, Michelle wore one of Isabel's designs during a fundraiser at Calvin Klein's home in June 2008. She wore a breezy black tunic and palazzo pants at the time‚Äîan elegant contrast to her bright and citrusy Inauguration Day look.  As the official First Lady, Michelle revisited Isabel's designs in 2009 while visiting Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace.  Isabel was born in 1960 in Camajuani, Cuba, and emigrated with her family, settling in New York in 1968, according to the NYT. After learning to sew at a young age, she studied at the Fashion Institute of Technology then transferred to Parsons School of Design. She left before graduation to intern with Diana Vreeland at the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, according to the paper. In 1984, the same year she married Ruben, she debuted her eponymous fashion line.   In 2012, she published her autobiography, Roots of Style: Weaving Together Life, Love, and Fashion. In part of the book, she explains her process behind designing Michelle's now-famous inauguration look, which consisted of wool lace for the January weather.  "We did not want Michelle to freeze," she wrote, according to an excerpt shared by Racked. "I wanted this coat to protect the First Lady, to comfort and hug her like a friend, while still allowing her relaxed body language to shine through and speak."  
 Naomi Campbell, Claudia Schiffer, Cindy Crawford, Helena Christensen, and Carla Bruni returned to the catwalk to honor Gianni Versace.  It's been 20 years since the tragic death of Gianni Versace and to celebrate the late designer's legacy, Donatella Versace hosted a very special Versace show during Milan Fashion Week today.  Along with a Spring 2018 collection paying homage to Gianni's greatest designs, the original '90s supermodels reunited on the runway for the occasion. Naomi Campbell, Cindy Crawford, Claudia Schiffer, Carla Bruni, and Helena Christensen all walked hand-in-hand behind Donatella for an incredible finale down the runway. Each wearing a gold Versace chainmail gown, the surprise reunion made for a truly goosebumps-inducing moment:  Naomi Campbelll, Claudia Schiffer, Cindy Crawford, Carla Bruni, Helena Christensen, strutting the @Versace runway one more time #MFW pic.twitter.com/8D9qBVPU4V  Three decades since their modeling careers kicked off, the supers all still look incredible on the catwalk well into their 40s (Campbell and Schiffer are 47, Christensen is 48, Bruni is 49, and Crawford is 51).   Versace celebrated the 20th anniversary of Gianni's death with bringing out the original supermodels. Cindy, Naomi, Carla, Claudia & Helena. pic.twitter.com/bJoskuFaWZ A show to remember. For the 20th anniversary of the death of Gianni @Versace, the 90s supermodels came out of retirement and it was üí•üí•üí• #MFW pic.twitter.com/trihiQ7nHb Meanwhile, Crawford's 16-year-old daughter, runway breakout star Kaia Gerber, also walked the show in a vibrant yellow cheetah print look.  With both the OG supermodels and today's top models including Gigi, Bella, Kendall, and Kaia all together on the same runway, we can't think of a better way to honor the late Gianni Versace. 
 Sweater weather is officially here.  Sometimes things that are considered "basic" are really just mass because they're awesome. Take the entire idea of "sweater weather." It ranks up there with pumpkin-flavored ephemera. But truly, when it's a little crisp, a little sunny, warm enough to skip a coat, just cool enough for some great cashmere, it's all about a great knit. Shop the pieces that make sweater weather our favorite time of year‚Äîand let's let our basic flags fly.  A heavy gauge knit isn't usually a date-night look, but Katie Holmes proves the haters wrong in a bra top and cardi set by Khaite. This works just as well over a knit bralette as it does a slip dress or jeans and a tee. A great black knit will  conquer all of your fall styles foes. Just add jeans and boots and call it a look. This knit is foolproof. We love it with little plaid kilts. wide-leg denim, black trousers. You name it, it works. Feeling a little boho this fall? Take that idea to a fun fringe sweater. We love that this fringe is for the slightly bohemian minimalist‚Äîa streamlined girl willing to dip a toe into the hippie pond. What is sweater weather for if not a big cozy knit to live in all season? This cardi fits the bill. A highlighter pink cardi makes for an unexpectedly cool companion for mustard colored trousers, as seen on Anna Rosa Vitiello. Wear this Versace, Versace, Versace with everything from pencil skirts to baggy jeans. The "ladies who lunch" sweater is getting a makeover for the cool kids. We love the idea of this classic piece paired with denim cut-offs. Check, please! This cardigan just makes you look and feel rich.

 Get ready, Zara addicts.  If you're addicted to Zara but sick of having the same pieces as everyone else, good news: the store's sister brand is finally making its way to the U.S.  Meet Bershka: the European retailer offering up on-trend pieces at an affordable price point (yes, just like Zara). The brand, which is also owned by the Inditex Group, targets a bit of a younger consumer than Zara, but still specializes in fashion-forward pieces you can weave into your work and weekend wardrobes. Though Bershka launched its online store in the U.S. this past spring, the brand is officially making its brick-and-mortar debut with a pop-up location in New York.  Located at 580 Broadway in SoHo, Bershka's first U.S. store will be open for a 3-month period from now through January 2018. It's unclear if the brand intends to launch a temporary U.S. location in the future, but the new pop-up comes just in time for holiday shopping season.  If you're not located in New York to check out Bershka IRL, you can still shop the brand's fashion-forward pieces online. From vinyl skirts to plaid blazers, '90s-inspired puffers and more, the pieces mostly range from $25 to $60 for apparel and $9 to $30 for accessories. Shop them now at bershka.com.   It's just a game, get the looks ‚èØüéÆ Shop in bio A post shared by  Bershka (@bershkacollection) on Oct 11, 2017 at 9:53am PDT

 Can you wear the season's wildest shoes IRL?  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. We're all about taking runway fashion to the streets‚Äìwhether it's taking a tulle confection from Haute Couture grocery shopping in Paris or bringing Tom Ford's crystal-encrusted micro minis to a meeting in our New York offices. And when Spring 2018 graced the runways this past September, we could not help but notice the many pairs of standout runway shoes that begged the question‚Äìcan you actually wear those in real life?  We tasked WTFashion?! host and stylist, William Graper, to test drive our favorite pairs‚Äìfrom Versace's thigh-high embroidered boots to Dolce & Gabbana's floral enamel sandals‚Äìon the streets of New York City. Can you go for a run in Louis Vuitton sneakers? Do Chanel heeled rain-boots make it easier to frolic and sing in the rain? What happens when you climb barbed wire in Alexander Wang barbed wire sandals? Here, all the answers to our burning questions on Spring's wildest pairs. Shoes featured in order of appearance: Versace, Dolce & Gabbana, Alexander Wang, Louis Vuitton, Chanel and Helmut Lang Seen by Shayne Oliver.
 We're sharing the real stories behind your favorite #OOTD This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. In this week‚Äôs episode of This Look is Money, we hit the cobblestoned streets of Soho, one of New York City‚Äôs most fashionable neighborhoods, with four influencers to find out how they like to style themselves on the daily. Below, Jessica Clements, Sophia Visanji, Tar Mar, and Elena Taber breakdown their outfits that you can shop right now.  Who are you wearing? How much did it cost? What favors are you calling in? Think: something old, something new, something borrowed, and something bought resale. Prepare yourself for some major fashion inspiration.    Model and Youtuber Jessica Clements likes to mix vintage with comfort to ensure she is always cozy in the chilly weather. The 5' 9.5" beauty picked up a pair of white leather ankle booties from Stuart Weitzman with a $425 discount ($150, originally $575). ‚ÄúSurprisingly, they are the most comfortable heels I own,‚Äù she says of her pointed-toe shoes. Clements is a fan of trousers and recently picked up a neutral-toned checkered pair with a flared hem from Stone Cold Fox for  $150. To help her embrace cozy-girl chic, she added an oversized purple sweater from Nanushka ($325) with a pearl zipper pull. Clements notes she loves the "menswear vibe" of her top and the pearl detailing is something she loves because it "adds more uniqueness to the sweater."  She threw on an oversized purple jacket from Aritzia ($180) over her basics. "I love love love a blanket coat. Anything that is big and cozy makes it so much easier to walk around," Clements adds. Her red handle Chanel bag ($4,300) with gold-tone hardware was a Christmas present to herself. She originally went in looking for sneakers, but ‚ÄúI saw this, and I was just like, 'This is mine,'‚Äù she says as she hugs her purse. She accessorized her look with  a Logan Hollowell choker necklace with diamonds (gifted, $1,000) while her gold-tone earrings are also a gift from Luv AJ ($490). "These are like my trinity glasses. I always feel like a badass when I wear them," she says of her Chanel sunglasses ($630).   Sophia Visanji is an optometrist and creative director of her blog The Monocle Muse whose personal style "is a mix of modern and minimal, meets a little bit of eclectic and exotic." Starting from her shoes up, Visanji wore a pair of nude leather Mercanti Fiorentini pumps with a lucite block heel ($179).  Her standout jumpsuit ($160) was a vintage find from A Current Affair, a trade show that visits New York City about twice a year.  "I love it cause it's one size fits all. I can wear it in the summer, throw a jacket over it in the winter and fall. It‚Äôs super versatile," she says. Visanji's secret for successfully hunting for vintage pieces is to "look for something really out of the box, cause I find the most unique pieces when I'm shopping vintage."  Another must-have piece in Visanji's wardrobe is a killer leather jacket. Today she is sporting an effortlessly cool black version from All Saints ($525). When it comes to accessorizing, more is more for Visanji who adds a pair of face-framing Celine sunglasses to elevate her look. She layered on three rings from David Yurman, a local find in Saint Croix, and one from a friend who started Anuja Tolia jewelry. Her two necklaces are from Maria Pascual ($50) and a Cinco Store ($67), plus a chic ear jacket and cuff from Aaryah Jewelry ($99).   She admits her Celine Trap√®ze python bag is a splurge at $4,500, however, she uses the purse "every single day" and "it was definitely worth the investment," she adds.    "I‚Äôm definitely a jeans and a t-shirt kinda gal," declares Youtuber and blogger Tar Mar. "So for me to dress up those pieces and make them versatile, I like to invest in statement jackets and bags to really dress them up." Her white tee is a high street find from Mango ($16). Mar is a jeans fiend, and likes to "elevate" her usual blue wash denim with a pair of off-white or cream jeans. Today she is rocking a pair from & Other Stories ($80). Although she is based in New York, a city known for embracing all black looks, Mar encourages people to experiment with lighter colors. "I actually don't find it hard to wear a color like white and cream in New York City. I think people are little bit scared of getting it dirty, but you gotta live a little," she advises. 
 Mar admits that she is "such a sucker for square-toed anything," so naturally her pair of black Via Spiga boots ($300) is one of her most worn pair of shoes. "When I want something statement, I bust out my Prada," she says of her black leather crossbody bag with chain detailing ($2,200). Whenever she's "feeling extra," Mar loves adding her Nanushka ($600) puffer jacket. (A red version is also available and on sale $434). Her muted color palette and clean style allows Mar plenty of room to play around and have some fun with accessories. Her flattering sunglasses are a recent purchase from Celine ($300) and her ring ($250) pays homage to her native country. Mar explains that her Irish Claddagh ring symbolizes love, loyalty, and friendship.   She may have splurged on her diamond necklace ($1000), but Mar embraces mixing high value pieces with more affordable finds including her $100 necklace, both from undisclosed designers. As for her biggest style secret? It's where she finds her chic hoop earrings. "I always get questions about my hoops [and] I always go for really affordable ones from H&M ($10)," she adds.   "My style is definitely inspired by where I‚Äôm at and what‚Äôs around me," says Elena Taber. "I find a lot of inspiration from the style of the 70s, so I love to add a bit of retro flair to what I‚Äôm wearing."  Her vintage-inspired 'fit gets a pop of color courtesy of Taber's first fashion splurge (#treatyoself ) after graduation. Her red pointed toe ankle boots with a black heel from Vagabond ($160) holds a special place in her heart."For some people that [price] may not be a ton, but for me, at the time it definitely felt like an investment. And I was very excited to get a hold of them," she says.  Taber's no-fail fashion piece for when she wants "to be a little funky" is a printed pant. Her flared leg version from Urban Outfitters ($70)  is wearable all year-long because of it's neutral palette.  "80% of what I wore in high school and college was thrifted clothing, so I always love to add an inexpensive thrifted item still," Taber explains of her cost-friendly approach to style. Her red ribbed neck turtleneck that shows a sliver of her torso was a steal at $8. Another vintage find that she's "obsessed" with is her brown suede jacket contrast-stitching ($250). "My go-to things to thrift are usually funkier items. I think that's the beauty of thrifting, you can find pieces that nobody else has," Taber adds. To tie together her outfit, she added a wide black belt with a large silver buckle that she borrowed from a friend ($20). Taber loves to accessorize, especially when she can pick up pieces crafted by emerging local talent. Today, she layered a necklace from Mejuri ($70) with a complementary coin pendant chain from Elvis et Moi ($120). Her gold-tone hoops ($15) are from a random small business in Queens, New York and her cuff is also from Mejuri ($70).  "I actually collect a ring everywhere I go. It's my go-to souvenir," Taber says of her affordable presents to herself. Her five rings range from $25 to $40, and the first three was picked up in Lebanon, Oman, and the South of France while the last two are from undisclosed artisans ($30 a piece).  She is also a major supporter of buying sustainable clothing and accessories such as her black Angela Roi crossbody bag ($240). "I like to tell people that it‚Äôs not about perfection, but it‚Äôs about making little steps here and there, to be more conscious about where you shop, where you buy," Taber says. "I also think being aware of where your clothing is coming from, or how its impacting people,  is really good to keep in mind about where you're shopping.

 The 28-year-old face of the Kooples on her namesake bag, all-natural beauty routine, and low-key style The best style advice I‚Äôve ever received is to be yourself. And to be confident, because confidence is everything.  My personal style icons are Angelina Jolie in Gia and Milla Jovovich in The Fifth Element. Why? Come on, do you have to ask?  My go-to Kooples pieces are a leather jacket and a blazer. I love to just throw on a leather jacket with jean shorts and a T-shirt, or I‚Äôll pair a menswear-inspired blazer with jeans for a casual but chic look. A perfect handbag is both functional and stylish. Of course you want to look cool, but you also want a bag that is going to work with you, not against you. My sister gave mea hand-me-down bag when I was 14. It wasn‚Äôt anything fancy, but I loved the fact that it came from my sister. The Stella bag I designed with the Kooples was inspired by my day-to-day favorites. I love the quilted aspect, and a strap is great for the city. It‚Äôs just the right mix of edgy and sophisticated that I look for in my everyday style. My bag is ideal for travel. The wide-open middle is great to stuff all my travel essentials in: Victoria‚Äôs Secret Bombshell travel-size spray, Karl Lagerfeld + ModelCo lip gloss, a charger cable for my phone, gum, and some bitcoin [laughs]. There‚Äôs also a compartment on the side to store important, easy-to-reach items, like a boarding pass. I keep my makeup minimal. Lately I‚Äôve been trying to use more natural products, like rose water mist. I recently bought some aloe vera leaves, and I‚Äôve been patting them on as a moisturizer. I also love SK-II face masks.  When it‚Äôs time for bed, I try to meditate. I like to wash my face, and that‚Äôs it. I don‚Äôt use products at night. Then I feed my rescue dog, Tripp, a snack. I‚Äôm obsessed with him. He eats a little, then climbs into bed. I prefer flats to heels. I donate shoes I‚Äôm not wearing anymore. The number-one trend that needs to come back? Big hair. What trend needs to die is not for me to say. Let it ride.  My great-great-grandma Maxwell passed down a silver brooch. It‚Äôs a dragon with a Celtic symbol engraved on the back. I love it because of its energy.  I collect memories. I‚Äôll always remember one day in a park with my mom and dad, back when we were living in New Zealand. It was a fall day with a light breeze, and we were eating ice cream on a bench under some trees. I was really young. It wasn‚Äôt a day too different from any others, but there was something about it that‚Äôs stuck with me‚Äîthe echo of a brief moment. I‚Äôm into L.A. literature right now. I just finished reading West of Rome, by John Fante, and loved it.  My favorite place in the world is L.A. It‚Äôs my home.

 Karrueche Tran and Victor Cruz are our modern day Chuck and Blair on a very fashion-forward Upper East Side excursion. After actress Karrueche Tran and former New York Giant Victor Cruz wrecked The Plaza at BAZAAR's ICONS party during New York Fashion Week, we wondered what hell the super couple could raise if they were let loose on Manhattan's Upper East Side. BAZAAR.com reimagined this iconic duo as 2018's answer to NYC's most conniving and sexy on-screen couple, Chuck Bass and Blair Waldorf of Gossip Girl.

 Beach, please... It's all about a bag, a sarong, a dress, a maillot, that kill the beach game, but also look chic on the streets. Invest in the items that will take you through summer with utility‚Äîand that something extra. Nothing says summer quite like a beachy white cotton dress. The best white dresses look equally at home on the beach as the beach bar.¬† Bring beach vibes with you everywhere you go with the right shell-inspired jewelry. With a simple white tee or linen button-down, you can bring seaside life with you anywhere you go. A one-piece bathing suit/rash guard does double duty as a fierce post-beach top. Up the fierce factor even more by buying into the look in leopard print. Nothing quite says summer-ready like a Hawaiian print shirt. It's perfect layered over a bandeau top and crochet shorts. Find your inner surf girl.¬† A sarong style skirt feels like it just walked off the boardwalk, but is perfect for an evening affair. We love it with a tee or a simple tank. If you haven't caught on, the buying power in beachwear is having it look perfect on the beach and at the caf√©. The maillot cover-up you never knew you always needed. It hardly gets more retro chic than a one-piece and great cat-eye shades. A feminine floral print can change your whole beachy mood. A solid beach dress should be airy, pretty, cool‚Äîand why not embrace color? A dramatic sleeve and a drop waist add up to an ideal, unexpected beach dress. It's all about a good accessory‚Äîa wide-brim hat, a salt water pearl anklet‚Äîto really make a beach look shine. Donni anklet, $84, shopdonni.com. SHOP NOW Never shy from a little drama. A chic logo bag takes beach-going to super luxe places. Wear this with denim cut-offs or a little white dress and never look better.¬† Even the most minimal-lover can appreciate a little sparkle on the beach. In other words, make it #extra. A suit made for the 'gram.¬†
 She's putting her focus on women. üôå   It's the end of an era: Adriana Lima is hanging up her Victoria's Secret Angel wings. The 37-year-old model announced this afternoon that she's saying goodbye to VS after 20 years and 18 runway shows with the famous lingerie brand.  After this legendary stint at VS, where will Lima head to next? According to People, she's turning her attention to projects focusing on women's empowerment.    "I‚Äôm looking forward to support women and being connected to different projects which support women around the world," she told the outlet ahead of walking her last VS fashion show today.  "[That's] my future from now on, but I am still happy that I am part of Victoria‚Äôs Secret this year," she added. "You guys are going to love this year‚Äôs show. To me it is definitely going be very special.‚Äù Lima broke the news of her departure with a heartfelt Instagram featuring a highlights reel of her famous walks on the Victoria's Secret runway.  "Dear Victoria," she wrote in the caption. "Thank you for showing me the world, sharing your secrets, and most importantly not just giving me wings but teaching me to fly. And all the ‚ù§Ô∏è to the best fans in the üåé! Love, Adriana üíñ "  Dear Victoria, Thank you for showing me the world, sharing your secrets, and most importantly not just giving me wings but teaching me to fly. ‚ù§Ô∏è to the best fans in the üåé! Love, Adriana üíñ A post shared by  Adriana Lima (@adrianalima) on Nov 8, 2018 at 2:00pm PST Lima's exit follows the departure of another iconic VS Angel, Alessandra Ambrosio, who walked her 17th and final show in 2017. Ambrosio told Entertainment Tonight that she was moving on to spend more time with her swimsuit line, Ale by Alessandra, and spend time on her acting career. 
 From Dior to Louis Vuitton, the runway highlights from Paris.  As the Spring 2019 collections make their way down the runways at Paris Fashion Week, we're highlighting all the standout looks of the season. Check back as round up the top runway looks that will define next season.  Nicholas Ghesqui√®re is in a groove at Louis Vuitton, and his collection was not as much about going in one direction, but more about a futuristic approach to how his woman (aka the new and improved LV girl) should dress. Everything felt forward-thinking, even the pieces that so clearly called to '80s silhouettes. Blouson sleeves, strong shoulders, micro minis, and Ghesqui√®re's version of street-style worthy space suits were just a few things on offer. If you're looking for Nicholas to show full-throttle evening, don't hold your breath; you're going to have to wait patiently for his muses‚Äìlike Emma Stone, Michelle Williams, and Alicia Vikander‚Äìto walk the red carpet in something custom. ‚ÄìCarrie Goldberg With sportif dwindling and new takes on office attire taking center stage at the collections, Miuccia Prada is taking advantage of the ball being in her court. Fashion, so it seems, has an appetite for sheerness, plays on uniform-dressing, and all things asymmetric‚Äìand that's right in Prada's wheelhouse for her younger, Frenchie, Miu Miu customer. As for evening options, there was loads of embroidery and sparkle, and if you're after something that takes dressing a little bit more seriously, the suiting stood out and felt (dare we say) more adult than Miu Miu's typical devotees. Perhaps this is the start of a coming of age tale for Prada's gamine, fresh-faced ingenue‚Äìbut there were still plenty of options for the Peter Pan-esque dresser who isn't ready to grow up just yet. ‚ÄìCarrie Goldberg "Let's go to the beach, the water's fine," said Karl Lagerfeld. Or at least he implied it through an array of by-the-sea ready looks shown on an actual sandy shore, right in the center of the Grand Palais. If you're planning the most-luxe summer trip, head to Chanel and stock up on biker shorts, summer suiting, loads of accessories, and cocktail options you can wear from the beach club to the boardwalk. Per Lagerfeld's standard in-theme shows, this one stuck to it's inspiration closely, veering off only towards the end when a suite of sheer, embroidered, and layered midnight blue and black eveningwear hit the sand‚Äìbut in looks still easy enough to sport once you've kicked your shoes off for a walk on the shore. The show's branded shirting and cardigans are going to be must-haves, as are the array of hats, piped nautical blazers, and C-H-A-N-E-L branded belts.  ‚Äì Carrie Goldberg In the age of everything fast, instant, immediate, and of-the-moment, Sarah Burton is consistently looking back into history for inspiration to create modern versions of clothes you'll cherish. Heirloom-level craftsmanship is nothing new for McQueen, nor is inspiration from ages past, but Burton took inspiration from today's female empowerment movement and threw it back in time, finding inspiration from women in history and their milestones‚Äìlike christenings, weddings, funerals, and key rights of passage. Naturally, in Burton's world, even women from the Arthurian, Georgian, and Victorian eras are badasses to boot. A christening gown inspired blouse was tucked under a sharp suit. Chain and leather corset details adorned both suits and romantic dresses. To Burton, it's the woman that makes the clothes and the clothes that make the woman‚Äìand limiting oneself to a single facet, be it feminine, romantic, ethereal, strong, bold, brave, or daring when getting dressed need not apply. If wanting to be equal parts hard and soft to don both Burton's femme dresses and sleek tailoring is wrong, we don't want to be right. ‚Äì Carrie Goldberg Stella McCartney shows Cali casual clothes in the most opulent space Paris has to offer‚Äîsetting what she calls "dirty pastels" and washed out neons against gilded walls for the ultimate contrast. There were tie-dye jumpsuits, slouchy suiting, organic denim, knit pants and silk slip dresses and satin shorts for that "just-rolled out of bed and look this cool" insouciance. -Kerry Pieri Giambattista Valli was inspired by Yoko Ono on her wedding trip to India in the '60s. It's there in the little white dresses, the tiger prints, the caftans. But Valli is a romantic at heart, and those high-low hem gowns have become his signature‚Äîdone up here in ethereal florals. It's an undeniably pretty collection with jet-setting in mind, a mood that prevailed in Paris. Who can blame anyone for needing an escape‚Äîand a great wardrobe to wear on it. -Kerry Pieri
 They look stunning üòç.  Update 11/13: Burberry has released a two-minute short film directed by Juno Calypso to accompany its holiday campaign. The feature, titled Close Your Eyes and Think of Christmas, stars Matt Smith, M.I.A., Kristin Scott Thomas, Naomi Campbell, and her mother, Valerie Morris-Campbell. The mother-daughter model duo close out the video, lounging on a couch while donning Burberry's signature check from head to toe . "Juno explores the dance between the reality and fantasy of a very British Christmas, drawing on her own experiences and rituals; from the unpredictable British weather to family togetherness, delayed trains to festive feasts," the video's description reads.  Original story, 11/1: Burberry isn't wasting any time getting into the holiday spirit. The British brand has already teased its Festive Campaign for the year, featuring some of U.K.'s finest, including supermodel Naomi Campbell‚Äîand her mom.  Valerie Morris-Campbell, a model herself, joins the star-studded roster, which includes The Crown's Matt Smith, actress Kristin Scott Thomas, rapper M.I.A., and British artist and photographer Juno Calypso, who also shot and directed the campaign. Both Campbells wear a white shirt and black blazer in their portraits.  The full campaign releases on Tuesday, November 13, but you can get a sneak peek at the imagery below. This is hardly the mother-daughter duo's first time modeling together. In 1993, they hit the Mugler runway together in complimentary black and white ensembles. Then, in 2010, they resumed the double act by walking in the Fashion for Relief charity show in London.  Naomi often brings her mother to fashion events. Last December, she brought her mom as her date to The Fashion Awards in London. The pair both wore all-black ensembles on the red carpet, with Naomi in a tulle gown by Versace and Valerie in a sleek suit and fur stole and Bulgari necklace. You can thank Valerie for teaching Naomi how to strut on the runway. "When I was 12 or 13, she appeared in a fashion show, and I remember her showing me how to walk in the hallway at home," Naomi recalled in an autobiography, excerpted by The Guardian in 2016. "Lionel Richie was playing in the background and I watched her walk up and down to the beat of the music."
 "Designer of Dreams" is coming to The Victoria and Albert Museum in London. In February 2019, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London will open the largest and most comprehensive Christian Dior exhibition ever in the U.K. "Christian Dior: Designer of Dreams" will highlight the iconic designer's history and influence on fashion from 1947 to today. To put its size into context: this will be the museum's biggest fashion exhibition since "Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty in 2015." "Based on the major exhibition Christian Dior: Couturier du R√™ve, organized by the Mus√©e des Arts D√©coratifs, Paris, the exhibition will be reimagined for the V&A. A brand-new section will, for the first time, explore the designer‚Äôs fascination with British culture," said the museum in a statement.  Dior's British inspirations ranged from the ocean liner Queen Mary to Savile Row suiting. He staged fashion shows at landmarks like London's Savoy Hotel and Blenheim Palace. He also designed for prominent British figures including author Nancy Mitford, ballerina Margot Fonteyn, and actual royalty, Princess Margaret. (She wore his designs on her 21st birthday.) The exhibition will run from February 2, 2019 to July 14, 2019, and tickets will become available this fall. (So start planning your trips now.) Ahead is a sneak peak of what you can expect from "Designer of Dreams" this winter.  1947 Spring-Summer Haute Couture collection sketch by Christian Dior.

 "RUTHLESS" Last week, model Ming Xi unintentionally became the center of attention at the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show when she fell on the catwalk in Shanghai. And while the runway show is usually filmed twice so any blunders can be edited out of the final broadcast, Xi's slip-up still aired on TV. There was also footage of the model crying backstage after she finished her walk, which is something fans didn't see last week when videos of her plunge first surfaced online. Some viewers took to Twitter, upset that Xi's fall and crying weren't edited out.  Others simply sent the model messages of support, and praised how she gracefully got back up and kept walking after her tumble, smile and all.  Even Victoria's Secret applauded Xi's "grace and determination" on Twitter.  The day after tumbling on the catwalk, Xi addressed her fall with the most gracious response in an emotional Instagram post. The model revealed she was upset to have fallen "in front of my mother's and my people's eyes" in her native city of Shanghai, but she thanked her fans and fellow models for their support, especially Gizele Oliveira, who helped her get back on her feet on the runway.  Xi ended on a positive note:  "I will pick myself up from where I fell, and I will keep going in order to repay all the support you all have given me!!" This marked her fifth year walking the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show. We can't wait to see her again next year.  As many of you may already know, I fell during my 5th year walking at the Victoria's Secret show yesterday. It was no doubt one of the hardest moments I have ever had to go through in my career, especially since the show was taking place in my hometown, in front of my mother's and my people's eyes. However, the support I received from everyone yesterday was incredible and I am truly grateful to everyone who was there for me. @ed_razek Thank you for your supportive words and your continuous support throughout these 7 years. @giizeleoliveira Thank you for helping me up after the fall, it was a very selfless and loving act from you. Thank you to all the girls who rushed to comfort me at backstage after what had happened, you are all family to me. Lastly thank you to everyone who sent and left me supportive messages. I will pick myself up from where I fell, and I will keep going in order to repay all the support you all have given me!! ‚ù§Ô∏èÔ∏è#vsfashionshow @victoriassecret A post shared by  Ming Xi (@mingxi11) on Nov 20, 2017 at 8:24pm PST
 The royal made fast fashion look completely regal.  It's not every day that a royal steps out wearing fast fashion but today, Queen Letizia proved that budget-friendly style can look just as regal as any luxury designer.  The always impeccably dressed Spanish royal wore a Zara floral midi dress featuring pink and red flowers on a teal background. Paired with plum pumps and jeweled earrings, the flouncy frock made for the perfect fall dress.  Proving elegant style comes at every price point, Queen Letizia's Zara dress retails for $90 and miraculously, it hasn't sold out yet. But if Kate Middleton and Princess Victoria of Sweden are any indication, royals wearing fast fashion tends to sell out almost immediately, so act fast if you want to scoop up this floral piece for fall.

 An exclusive sneak peek at some of the designer items in Target's Anniversary Collection special. When Target announced it was bringing back archival pieces from 20 of its designer collaborations over the years, the ears of many once-scorned shoppers perked up. For those who missed out on some of the instantly sold-out collaborations (from Missoni madness to Proenza Schouler flying off the shelves), this is a second chance to score the affordably priced designer pieces.  Among the lineup of designer collaborations making a limited-edition comeback is one of Target's most popular: Rodarte. Launched in 2009, the Rodarte x Target collection featured 55 pieces including dresses, skirts, tights, and more‚Äîall designed by the brand's creative directors, Kate and Laura Mulleavy. As part of Target's 20 years of designer partnerships celebration, nine pieces from the archival collection will be reissued.  Included in the Anniversary Collection are romantic tulle and lace dresses, a blouse, camisole, and skirts. A sheer magenta pussy bow blouse and matching tulle skirt capturing the essence of the ethereal, ultra-feminine Californian brand will also be reissued. Prices range from $20 for the lace camisole to $40 for the mini dress. The blouses and skirts will retail for $25 and $30, respectively.  Along with Rodarte, Target will also be bringing back pieces from collaborations with Missoni, 3.1 Phillip Lim, Zac Posen, Lilly Pulitzer, Jason Wu, Anna Sui, and more. Prices will range from $7 to $160 and‚Äîunlike many of the previous designer collabs‚Äîwill include extended sizing.  ‚ÄúTwo decades ago, when we first set out to make beautifully designed products affordable, we created a movement in retail and culture that proclaimed that design could be‚Äîand should be‚Äîfor all,‚Äù Rick Gomez, Target‚Äôs executive vice president and chief marketing and digital officer, said in a statement. ‚ÄúThis Anniversary Collection takes our guests on a nostalgic journey through our designer collaboration history where they can discover products that they‚Äôll fall in love with all over again, or for some, for the very first time.‚Äù Target's Designer Anniversary Collection will be available to shop starting Saturday, September 14, in stores and online at target.com.

 From the breakout models to Bad Gal Riri on a dirtbike.  Now that the Spring 2018 collections have officially come to an end in New York, take a look back at the greatest moments of the week. From the rising new models to unexpected front row stars and Marc Jacobs's grand finale of bold colors and prints, here's a recap of the week's highlights.  When Tom Ford sent invitations for his Spring 2018 show along with a bottle of his new fragrance, Fucking Fabulous, we knew it would be...well, fucking fabulous. On the eve of New York Fashion Week, the designer debuted a collection of glitz, glamour, and ultra-sexy silhouettes at the Park Avenue Armory. The star-studded front row hosted a newly blonde Kim Kardashian, Julianne Moore, Ciara, Chaka Khan, and more.  Cindy Crawford's supermodel offspring made her highly-anticipated runway debut at Calvin Klein, just days after turning 16. In her first week of walking, Kaia went on to open the Alexander Wang show, walk Coach and Fenty x Puma by Rihanna, and then made a grand finale closing the Marc Jacobs show.  Carine Roitfeld's "Icons" party, held at New York's Plaza Hotel, reigned supreme with a performance by September cover star The Weeknd and endless A-list appearances from Selena Gomez, Nicki Minaj, Kim Kardashian, Jared Leto, Courtney Love, the model set, and more.  Leslie Jones became the front row cheerleader fashion never knew it needed at Christian Siriano's Spring 2018 show. The comedian couldn't contain her emotions over all the stunning runway gowns‚Äîwhich ranged from having her breath taken away to yelling "YASSS" and "YOU WORK IT, GIRL!" at the models. Watch the incredible moment in all of its glory here.   When the haters tried to say I was too extra yesterday.....ü§î I turned around and CLOSED ANOTHER RUNWAY SHOW even more EXTRA!! & ima do it AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN cause these b!tches can't take!!! Mc Debra voice üíÖüèæüí™üèæüò©üò©üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüíºüíºüíºüíºüíº #philippplein #FashionWeek #NYFW #HarlemGirl thank you @philipppleininternational u da shit!!! and @future you killed the live music bro!!! üìπ: @imanshumpert A post shared by Jimmy Neutch (@teyanataylor) on Sep 9, 2017 at 9:42pm PDT The "Fade" dancer proved her runway prowess when she closed the show at Philipp Plein with one of the most epic walks of all time. Giving us endless attitude, sass, and killer moves, Taylor went on to walk The Blonds and GCDS shows as the runway's fiercest new star.  Alexander Wang brought the fashion set to Bushwick, Brooklyn for a Spring 2018 runway staged on the street. Models, led by Kaia Gerber, entered the runway via a WANGFEST tour bus. As for the after party? There were performances by Cardi B, Ashanti and Ja Rule along with a bouncy house, donut towers, an ice bar, cocktail juice pouches, and an inflatable pool filled with bottles of Budweiser. Pretty low-key.  It might as well have been renamed New York Fenty Week this season, as Rihanna took over with the launch of her Fenty Beauty line followed by an unforgettable Fenty x Puma runway show Sunday night. The runway of pink sand mountains kicked off with motocross stuntmen soaring across the set on their bikes‚Äîand subsequently ended with Rihanna taking her final "bow" on the back of a bike. The collection itself was a strong mix of colorful '90s-infused nylon pieces with '80s swimwear and risk-taking stiletto flip flops.   There is a first time for everything, even at 83! First #nyfw show @prabalgurung, a kind man doing great work in fashion and beyond. A post shared by Gloria Steinem (@gloriasteinem) on Sep 10, 2017 at 4:28pm PDT At 83 years old, the feminist icon had her first fashion show experience sitting front row at Prabal Gurung's Spring 2018 show, which she proudly documented on Instagram. Given the designer's penchant for casting diverse models and using fashion to make activist statements, it was a fitting choice for Steinem's first runway.  In the sweetest sister moment to ever grace the catwalk, Bella helped Gigi down the runway at Anna Sui's Spring 2018 show after the model suffered a wardrobe malfunction and had to walk wearing only one high heel. The younger Hadid held onto her sister as the two walked arm-in-arm for the finale. Despite the fact, Gigi of course champed her way down the runway  and ultimately, the faux pas made for Instagram gold. Sister power.  With a performance at Alexander Wang's after party and several front row appearances throughout the week, the rapper quickly became fashion's most unexpected breakout star.  The singer surprised everyone with a beautiful set at Maryam Nassir Zadeh's show, which was held outside at the East River Park track. For what felt like a completely spontaneous performance, Solange also debuted her new blonde braids.  Ralph Lauren's impressive luxury car collection served as the backdrop to the designer's Spring 2018 show. Held at the designer's private garage in Bedford, New York, showgoers were treated to a collection that infused high fashion with fast cars.  For the grand finale of New York Fashion Week, Marc Jacobs staged a breathtaking collection of color, prints, and bright turbans topping off every look. Bringing back maximalism, the vacation-inspired collection hit the runway in complete silence at the Park Avenue Armory‚Äîuntil the finale brigade when loud opera music filled the empty room. 
 The designer will now concentrate fully on his eponymous label. Jason Wu has confirmed that he will be cutting professional ties with Hugo Boss after acting as the brand‚Äôs artistic director of womenswear for five years, WWD reports. Wu will show his final collection for the house‚Äîa Gallery Collection presentation at Cedar Lake‚Äîtoday during New York Fashion Week.   ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs public knowledge that about a year and a half ago there was a management change at Hugo Boss,‚Äù Wu explained. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve stayed on to help the brand with the transition of its next stage. It‚Äôs going on to the next generation and iteration of Hugo Boss.‚Äù   Wu also explained that he was ‚Äúvery, very proud‚Äù of his five-year stint at the brand, adding, ‚ÄúI feel like by today‚Äôs standards that‚Äôs a very long time.‚Äù As well as his role at Hugo Boss, the designer has been running his own namesake label, which is now 10 years old. Stepping down from this role will allow him to concentrate full-time on his own brand.   ‚ÄúI‚Äôve worn many different hats in the past 10 years and throughout my whole career, I am never the complaining kind,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI love doing a lot of things. One of my biggest idols is Karl Lagerfeld. I think to be able to do a lot if fortunate. I‚Äôm really happy to have done a lot. But I‚Äôm also happy now that I can concentrate 100 per cent on my brand‚Ä¶ After 10 years in the business, I feel like I need to devote all my energy to my own label.‚Äù   It has not yet been announced who will replace Wu at Hugo Boss, but the label‚Äôs executives were very complimentary of the designer's work with them.  Brand officer Ingo Wilts said, ‚ÄúI feel certain that he will approach all his future projects with the same compelling passion and zest that he brought to Hugo Boss‚Äîand for which we are highly indebted to him at that time.‚Äù

 The new styles will make you do a triple-take.  Ugg boots have been a winter mainstay since the early 2000s but now, the classic boot is getting a redesign that will certainly catch your attention.  In a special collaboration with French Fashion brand Y/Project, Ugg reimagined its iconic boot for a collection including slouchy over-the-knee styles, triple layered renditions, and slides. One thing's for certain: these are not your Paris Hilton's early aughts Uggs.  Tapping into the ongoing ugly shoe trend (let us not forget this past season's Balenciaga Crocs), Ugg and Y/Project's designs are a mash-up of thigh-high, fashion-forward takes and reconstructed silhouettes.  "The UGG Classic boot is one of the most recognizable shoes in history. Its timeless and challenging design made it a worldwide statement. Y/Project is about challenges. Since launch we've been twisting the grounded codes, we challenged the acceptable and triggered people by putting focus on the unexpected. By reworking the Classic boot with a typical Y/Project twist such as the triple overlaps and the extra-long legs we want to celebrate the UGG brand's unique history," Glenn Martens, creative director of Y/Project, said in a statement from the brand.  The boots will range in price from $300 - $1,400 and will be available to shop this fall.  As the wise philosopher Paris Hilton would say: That's hot. (...Or that's not?)
 The model embraces her baby bump with some bold looks.  When it comes to maternity style, Slick Woods isn't here to play it safe or adhere to any so-called "rules" about covering up her body. The 22-year-old model (and muse to Rihanna) is fully embracing her pregnancy with some boundary-pushing looks at New York Fashion Week.  Attending Elle Magazine's NYFW kickoff party on Wednesday night, Slick stunned in a sleek black suit by streetwear brand Seen. The model opted to go topless under the unbuttoned jacket, showing off her baby bump (and that pregnancy glow) on the red carpet.  But Slick didn't stop there with the daring looks. Last night, at  the Daily Front Row's Fashion Media Awards, she opted for a see-through feathered mini dress with some pink furry heels to match. The naked dress moment made for another unexpected maternity look that celebrated her pregnancy instead of trying to cover it up. At a time when women are still being shamed for breastfeeding in public, Slick's maternity looks challenge the outdated and sexist notions that a woman should have to conceal her pregnant body. And while Slick has always been one to push boundaries when it comes to fashion, doing so during her pregnancy (and at New York Fashion Week, no less) is a reminder that we don't have to limit "maternity style" to flowing, oversized dresses that women need to hide behind.   22 A post shared by @ slickwoods on Aug 14, 2018 at 2:57pm PDT Here's hoping Slick makes another appearance this week modeling at Rihanna's Savage x Fenty lingerie presentation on the final night of New York Fashion Week.

 The world‚Äôs oldest working model looks back on more than 60 years of photographs in Harper‚Äôs Bazaar.  Carmen Dell‚ÄôOrefice was just 13 years old when she was discovered on a crosstown bus on New York‚Äôs 57th Street, some 73 years ago. Now, at 86, she‚Äôs still at it, which makes her the longest-working model in history. That‚Äôs her story and she‚Äôs sticking to it. And why not? It happens to be true. I‚Äôve known Carmen (she goes by her first name only) for more than 20 years. But even today when I am in her company, I cannot take my eyes off her. That‚Äôs how strikingly beautiful she is. She‚Äôs also one of the sweetest people on the planet. There‚Äôs not a diva‚Äôs bone in her five-foot-nine-inch body‚Äîthough she‚Äôd be the first to admit that her bones are a bit more brittle these days.  Her relationship with Harper‚Äôs Bazaar began sporadically in the early 1950s, following her career at Vogue and an ongoing campaign for Vanity Fair‚Äîthe lingerie company, not the magazine. When she seriously caught the eye of Diana Vreeland, Bazaar‚Äôs extremely particular fashion editor, she was already 26, nearing retirement age for most models at the time. Mrs. Vreeland wanted Richard Avedon to bring Carmen to Paris to shoot the collections for the September 1957 issue, but Avedon was resistant. ‚ÄúDiana twisted his arm,‚Äù says Carmen. ‚ÄúAt the time he was besotted with model Suzy Parker, who was a close friend of mine and a year younger.‚Äù Avedon relented with a caveat: that he‚Äôd bring Suzy along as a backup in case Carmen didn‚Äôt work out. ‚ÄúHe was being forced to use me, and I knew it,‚Äù she laments. ‚ÄúHe focused on everything he thought was wrong with me, including the length of my hair. I didn‚Äôt have much of an ego, so I never said a word.‚Äù Luckily, it all went beautifully and both models appeared in the feature. ‚ÄúWe shot on the streets of Paris‚Äîa famous one is of me in midair under an umbrella‚Äîand at the Folies-Berg√®re.‚Äù Eventually Avedon felt more comfortable in Carmen‚Äôs company, and she in his. ‚ÄúI felt most at ease with him in the studio when he would play music‚ÄîCole Porter and others,‚Äù she recalls. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôd dance around and gesticulate. That meant I didn‚Äôt have to interpret his signals.‚Äù Working with Lillian Bassman was an altogether different story. ‚ÄúShe was very slow and very quiet,‚Äù Carmen says of posing for the pioneering female photographer, whose images were laced with a furtive eroticism. ‚ÄúWhen she was shooting she would half-close her eyes.‚Äù For Carmen, a tightly cropped black-and-white photograph of her lacing up her own corset says it all. There were other Bazaar photographers Carmen did stories with, like the eccentric Gleb Derujinsky. ‚ÄúGleb was rather a bad boy and not at all reliable. The truth is that he was far more interested in gliding. If it was a good day weatherwise, he‚Äôd just as soon be up in the sky as holding a camera in his hands.‚Äù In the photo he took of Carmen in a Paris bistro for the April 1957 issue, she wore a Chanel suit that she fell in love with but couldn‚Äôt afford. When she got home she took some drapery fabric and, excellent seamstress that she was, made herself a copy of the suit‚Äîshades of Scarlett O‚ÄôHara. As for the floating shot of Carmen by Melvin Sokolsky in the October 1960 issue, she explains: ‚ÄúMel had a bicycle seat attached to a pipe positioned halfway up the wall. It went through the gray seamless paper and was solidly affixed to another wall behind it. The back seams of my garments had been opened to accommodate the following maneuver: I had to climb up a ladder, with an assistant on another ladder, until I could position myself on the seat. I had only my well-exercised thighs and Cleopatra‚Äôs Clutch muscles to keep me balanced‚Äîall in order to live out Mel‚Äôs fantasy.‚Äù In the past couple of years, Carmen has shot campaigns for Sephora and H&M and closed an haute couture show for Guo Pei. She is also the subject of an upcoming documentary, Carmen Dell‚ÄôOrefice: The Legend Down the Hall, instigated by her longtime friend, fashion illustrator David Downton. He convinced her to let photographer Tim Petersen follow her almost everywhere she went, including the operating room for one of her hip surgeries, and most recently on assignment in Beijing for a mere four days. Of Carmen, Petersen says admiringly, ‚ÄúFive years ago, I set out to document ‚Äòa magic carpet ride‚Äô of her life and ended up on a fascinating roller coaster of galas, hospitals, couture, first-class suites, and drag queens‚Äîall in the omnipresence of real star power.‚Äù ‚ÄúI had only my well-exercised thighs and Cleopatra‚Äôs Clutch muscles to keep me balanced‚Äîall in order to live out Mel‚Äôs fantasy.‚Äù But even with all of the highs in Carmen‚Äôs life and career, it‚Äôs her onetime strained relationship with Avedon that sticks with her. ‚ÄúFortunately, it has a nice ending,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúMany years later, I was to be part of a TV commercial he was directing. It was a huge production with all of this unnecessary busyness. Dick came onto the set and asked, ‚ÄòDo you mind if I sit next to you?‚Äô By all means, I replied. Pull up a chair. He paused for a few seconds, then out came these words: ‚ÄòRemember those wonderful days? I only wish I knew then what I know about you now.‚Äô ‚Äù If only.

 We took the most out-of-the-box looks from New York's Spring 2018 runways to the streets. The Paris Couture shows had us wondering whether even the most adventurous of fashion girls could wear Haute Couture in real life‚Äîand we put our theory to the test. Turns out, it's not so tough to hit the food market, the metro and the quaint caf√©s of the Marais in a gargantuan gown. In the spirit of test driving jaw-dropping looks from the runway, we took to New York Fashion Week to comb the Ready-to-Wear collections for all the looks that may not be dubbed "wearable"‚Äîto prove just how easy it is to wear this season's top trends IRL. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. Start the day off in Siriano. If you're lucky enough to own these walking florescent ruffles from Christian Siriano's Spring 2018 runway, odds are you'll be partying all night long‚Äìand heading to work in a hurry. En route, you'd probably stop off at your favorite diner, where you're a local and the manager knows your name and how you like your coffee, for a morning pick me up.   Before a hard day's work, its time to hit the gym‚Äîin Fenty x Puma by Rihanna, bien sur. The best work outs usually happen when you're looking (and feeling) your best. Whoever says there is no such thing as (or no need for) an athletic heel, a gym-worthy jumpsuit, or an ultra-low pair of parachute pants, should reconsider. There is no leg workout quite like hitting an elliptical or a treadmill in 5 inch heels‚Äìwe hear it does wonders for toning your legs‚Äìand making your shoes a walkable stretch in the process.   It appears these pieces are as practical as they are irreverent‚Äìand make for the chicest workout we've ever seen. After some cardio and weights, a quick rinse, blow dry and costume change, you have business to attend to. Take a risk and trade in your gym clothes for a micro mini (with crystal-encrusted undergarments to match).  Tom Ford's ombr√© crystal after-hours looks turned 9 to 5 when we took them for a spin in the office and challenged their NSFW-style. It appears that ample doses of sparkle make a confident impression in meetings, while sky-high stilettos paired with the shortest of hemlines and strong shoulders ooze authority rather than sex appeal when they demand to be taken seriously. These looks get bonus points for seamlessly transitioning from the office to a crazy-fun night out. Office hours are much more fun when you're covered in sparkles.     Bold colors make running errands less of a chore. Head out in bright tones and vibrant prints: like Josep Font's embroidered riff on paisley for Delpozo. Against the concrete jungle of Manhattan, you'll be sure to stand out. Embrace it by throwing on a lip color that makes the brights in your look pop. Your inspiring ensemble will boost the mood during rush hour, and turn heads.    Confetti-clad looks are reason enough to throw a party...and create your own rom-com-worthy fashion montage while you're at it. Carolina Herrera's cocktail looks from her Spring 2018 collection, which debuted at the MoMA, call for feather boas, strings of beads and endless aisles of balloons, candy and favors. Be forewarned, they might just inspire a little mid-shopping dance party.

 The collection was inspired by the designer's home in Jamaica. Ahead of Ralph Lauren's Spring 2018 see-now, buy-now show this morning, the designer took to Instagram to share several videos highlighting the inspiration behind his collection: the island of Jamaica.   Inspired by Round Hill Hotel and Villas, the family's vacation home and resort in Montego Bay, the show kicked off with a string of barefoot models wearing vibrant blue and white sundresses. The first six models hit the runway sans any footwear at all‚Äîopting for a laid-back, island vibe instead of teetering heels. Though the rest of the runway looks featured models walking in a variety of vacation-ready sandals, pumps, and espadrilles, the designer's decision to kick off the show with all barefoot looks was a swift departure from his typically more buttoned-up collections.   From ultra-nautical blue and white looks to designs featuring the yellow and green colors of Jamaica's flag, Lauren's spring collection was a mashup of the island's serene beach vibes along with the brand's signature style. Along with the collection, the runway itself was built as a mini version of the designer's Jamaican retreat.  "Everyone wishes for a magical place where they can step out of time and into the beauty of nature. I wanted to share the mood, the light, the blue and white freshness of my retreat in Jamaica," Lauren wrote in the show notes.   From the nautical sundresses to the striped separates and more, the spring collection is already available to shop now at RalphLauren.com. Luckily, it's fairly easy to DIY the barefoot runway look yourself at home.  SHOP RALPH LAUREN'S SPRING 2018 COLLECTION HERE 
 The 'Starboy' singer is back with another collection for the retailer.  Following a successful collaboration with H&M last spring, The Weeknd is back with a second collection for the Swedish retailer this fall. The singer shared a first look at the new pieces on Instagram today, posing in a purple and black varsity jacket embroidered with a "W" and black patches.  According to his caption, the collection is set to hit stores and online September 28th.   While it's unclear how many pieces will be included in the singer's second collection for the fast fashion retailer, his spring line featured leather jackets, sweatshirts, bomber jackets, trench coats, and more. So the purple satin varsity jacket he Instagrammed is likely just the first of many more pieces to come.  This is just the latest in The Weeknd's foray into the fashion world. Last month, he designed sneakers for Puma and nabbed his first September cover posing alongside Adriana Lima, Irina Shayk, and Candice Swanepoel for Harper's BAZAAR.

Since then we have grown tremendously, selling our collection worldwide. We take inspiration from modern art and artists such as Alexander Calder and Kandinsky, to name a few.What is the Mateo philosophy?The brand‚Äôs philosophy is to make great personal jewelry at affordable luxury prices to last a lifetime.

 She sells seashells by the seashore.  Make jewelry brand of the moment Brinker & Eliza your go-to destination for all your warm-weather accessory needs. The mother-daughter duo behind the collection tells us what makes their namesake label so special, why the exclusive ShopBAZAAR Hero deserves your attention, and the craftsmanship that goes into each piece.  Describe the beginnings of Brinker & Eliza.My mom and I have been designing jewelry together for as long as I can remember. My mom, Brinker, was trained in silversmithing and metalworking. She used to have her own line of jewelry (walking into her studio was like walking into a candy store, only instead of candy, it was beads and charms and wire‚Ä¶) and we would always design pieces together on the side. We launched our joint line, Brinker & Eliza, in 2017. That‚Äôs when we set up the website, made a look book, decided on a name. In 2018, it became full-time. That‚Äôs really when it felt ‚Äúreal,‚Äù when we realized, Wow. We‚Äôre actually doing this.  My background is in fashion merchandising, which helped prepare me for a lot of what I do now. That said, I feel like we are both learning something new every day; h ow to handle growth (we‚Äôre a team of two); inventory management; the process of expanding wholesale. The list goes on, but that‚Äôs part of what has made this experience so satisfying. That, and the fact that we can do whatever we want with the product, no matter how ‚Äúout there‚Äù it is. We have definitely made some styles that may not have ‚Äúmainstream salability‚Äù potential, but for now, because we‚Äôre small, we get to take risks and make things that we love. "Our hope is that, when someone wears a Brinker & Eliza piece, it will always feel like it was made for them." Brand philosophy and vision?We‚Äôre a mother/daughter-run company, and we currently make everything by hand. There isn‚Äôt a piece that gets shipped out that we don‚Äôt touch. Now, as we grow, that model will have to change, which is both a relief (because it means we get to focus on other exciting areas of the brand), and a pretty scary concept! The most important thing to us as we continue to scale is that a personal element remains: that our customers know the people behind the brand, that they feel like they can DM us on Instagram to say hey, that every earring, necklace, bracelet continues to feel special. Our hope is that, when someone wears a Brinker & Eliza piece, it will always feel like it was made for them.  Inspiration behind the new collection?Being from a small beach town in Connecticut, going to the beach is a part of our day to day life, even in the winter. There‚Äôs still few things I‚Äôd rather do than walk along the beach with my mom and hunt for shells and sea glass. It's always been our ‚Äúthing.‚Äù For this collection, we played around with dyed shells and vintage shell florets. We also like to incorporate vintage and ‚Äúfound‚Äù elements into our lines, like 1940s zodiac pendants and other various charms that my mom has collected over the years. 5 words that describe the Brinker & Eliza customer?We can‚Äôt sum it up into five words, but we think she‚Äôs someone who doesn‚Äôt take herself too seriously, who has fun with fashion, and who enjoys playing dress up for everyday life, not just for an occasion that requires it. What makes the exclusive ShopBAZAAR Hero earrings so special?Three ruby-colored stones set these earrings apart. The second we saw the color of the stones against the shells, we just knew. Craftsmanship behind the pieces?We make each piece by hand in our studio in Connecticut. We pack and ship the jewelry ourselves, too. Matching up shells is one of our favorite parts of the process. It‚Äôs like a meditation, finding colors and sizes that match. Because they‚Äôre natural shells, drilling them takes care and skill. Luckily my mom is a wizard in this area. It‚Äôs mesmerizing to watch.

 On night three of London Fashion Week, the Woolmark Prize staged their annual fashion show with cash prizes totaling over 300,000AUD. Twelve international designers showed back to back, three of their best looks for the design competition in front of fashion editors, tastemakers and bold-faced name judges. This year's judges consisted of Instyle magazine editor in chief Laura Brown, former Lanvin creative director Alber Elbaz, and Tim Blanks just to name a few.  "There were 12 great designers today from around the world,‚Äù said Alber Elbaz who judged this year's competition. ‚ÄúIt was quite wonderful to see designers from places like Korea, China and Sweden, because sometimes in fashion we think everything happens in Paris, so this was a reminder that the world is big and fashion comes from everywhere around the world.‚Äù  Each designer was challenged to design something original to their brand using Merino wool. The show concluded with an acapella performance of Queen's "Don't Stop Me Now," and a flurry of confetti that fell inside Lindley Hall.  To get down to the final winners, Woolmark brought out surprise guest, Colin Firth, to announce the Innovation prize.  The actor divulged about his own relationship with fashion, as he's come to be regarded as one of the most stylish stars. But that wasn't always the case for the Brit.  "I spent most of my life fashion-blind, so this has been a steep learning curve," Firth told the crowd. "I had pretty much no engagement with fashion before, until I met Tom Ford, and that was an interest in tailoring‚Äînot really because of anything he said, but because being in the presence of Tom Ford requires you to scrub up a bit." Firth announced Edward Crutchley as the winner of the 100,00AUD award. The designer was then called back to the stage shortly after to accept his menswear designer award, picking up another 200,000AUD to invest into his business along with a mentor and a retail sponsor for his collection.  Game of Thrones' Gwendoline Christie did the final honors of the evening announcing the womenswear award, which was presented to the wife and husband duo behind Colovos, who will also receive 200,00AUD towards their brand and mentorship 
 And they're bedazzled... It's been a year since Christopher Kane sent his first designer crocs down the runway. They trended on Twitter, blew up Instagram, and became the most polarizing fashion news since Balenciaga voted Bernie. But today, Kane introduced his newest Croc collab in London, and to follow February's fur versions, he went all in on sparkle.  #ESfashion insta review. üì∏ @ChristopherKane: London's creative alchemist had a Royal Doulton figurine collecting domestic goddess in mind for SS18. But, of course, in true Kane fashion it was underlined with a somewhat subversive sauciness. 'I have always been obsessed by that pristine woman, so clean, so proper, yet having an emotional breakdown inside,' he explained in his show notes. Think Forties housecoats with gigantic jewelled buttons, silky slip dresses, spray-and-wipe jackets gussied up with doily lace collars and negligee gowns; all revisited with a Cynthia Payne, fetishist bent. His accoutrement edit was also subtly housebound, from hair-netted bags to sparkly crystal-clad 2.0 crocs and mop head heels. Kane has always had a taste for mixing the pretty with the provocative and today's show was part peep show (yes, they were arty bum motifs by John Kacere on dresses and tees), part domestic bliss. For the modern woman anyway. ‚úèÔ∏è @katrinaisrael #backstagewithES #ESmagazine #LFW #ChristopherKane #Londonfashionweek A post shared by  ES Magazine (@eveningstandardmagazine) on Sep 18, 2017 at 8:20am PDT There were several bright colorways (bulldozer yellow, Pepto pink, aqua, plus a black/white combo), each encrusted with massive diamant√© jewels. Paired with lace-laddered dresses and crayon red gowns, the Crocs also came in a high top version, with a crystallized piece peeking out from the plastic front. Was the shoe trippy? Sure. Gutsy? Absolutely. But also the most comfortable runway-approved footwear you could ever wear to a friend's wedding.  And for that, Mr. Kane, a grateful style squad thanks you.

 Courtesy of the founder of Donni... Almost four years ago, BAZAAR.com asked Donni (formerly Donni Charm) founder Alyssa Wasko to show us how to tie her fetching scarves as many ways as humanly possible. Apparently we weren't the only ones who saw Wasko's knack for making a scarf into something, well, more than a scarf. "After adding a single scarf top to our SS18 collection, things quickly turned," Wasko explained of how she fell into ready-to-wear, "I wanted to offer something that would give the look of a scarf, but tied as a top that was so easy, anyone could do it." A good designer is always looking for holes in the market, and once Wasko had her top, the ideal bottom wasn't far off,  "I was on a mission to find the perfect super high-waisted breezy linen pant to wear with it. Without success after searching high and low, I made them myself. This led to a second pair of pants and here we are!" "Here" is a full collection of California-inspired, vacation-ready sarong style skirts, bandeau tops, little tanks and those linen trousers in easy-to-wear shades of black, pink, brown, cream and khaki green. Coming in at under $200, they're also easy-to-buy and available now at Moda Operandi and shopdonni.com‚Äîjust in time for spring break.

 Riviter is helping brands better service consumers through social media.  With social media, influencers, and the quickly changing landscape of the Internet, the way we shop is constantly evolving. Our screen time‚Äîboth on the computer and our phones‚Äîis one of the biggest influences shaping what we buy today, whether we realize it or not. Tapping into that phenomenon, a female-founded startup out of Chicago is helping make online shopping more curated than ever through a patented algorithm.  Founded by Andi Hadisutjipto, Kris Woodbeck, and Rachel Chen, Riviter is a tech startup that uses image recognition technology and computer vision to analyze consumers' Instagram and Pinterest activity. With that information, it's then able to offer more personalized shopping recommendations on e-commerce sites. The company then works with major brands‚Äîranging from Maybelline New York to Yves Saint Laurent‚Äîto better service its shoppers.  At a time when most women get their shopping inspiration and ideas directly from influencers on Instagram and Pinterest, it makes sense to help brands curate their search through those platforms rather than simply tracking cookies on a browser.    Prada or nada @prada #SuppliedByPrada A post shared by  Chiara Ferragni (@chiaraferragni) on Feb 21, 2019 at 9:23am PST  If you've ever been haunted by ads for a product you once glanced at‚Äîwithout any real intention of actually purchasing‚Äîthat's a result of the one-faceted side of relying on cookies. Instead, Riviter is helping brands get a clearer picture of items you would want to buy based on the photos you like on Instagram or pin on Pinterest. The technology looks at color, style, and patterns for a more concise idea of what consumers want.   The technology, however, isn't entirely new. In fact, it's the same facial recognition tech used by Facebook for the platform's photo tags. But Riviter marks the first time its been used and optimized for fashion search and brands. If it can serve us better shortcuts to the items we actually want to buy online, then count us in.

 Australian designer Martin Grant opens up about the "Meghan effect" after the Duchess wore his cotton trench‚Äîtwice‚Äîand striking striped maxi dress just a couple of days later.  Australian designer Martin Grant has been flooded with orders since Meghan Markle stepped out wearing two of his designs during her Down Under tour with husband Prince Harry.  The Duchess of Sussex‚Äôs choice of a Grant cotton trench‚Äîworn twice‚Äîfollowed by a striking Grant striped maxi dress just a couple of days later, clearly marked the Paris-based Aussie designer as a favorite of the stylish royal.  The two designs are currently available for pre-order and, not surprisingly, major retailers, who initially placed orders in July, have been dialing Grant to increase units. Over the last two days, retailers including Barneys, Moda Operandi and Tomorrowland have increased orders. ‚ÄúThere is definitely a huge amount of interest for both of the pieces,‚Äù Grant told BAZAAR.com.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen around 10 major buyers come through to request more units."   Giving a glimpse into how his designs ended up being worn by Meghan, Grant said the Duchess‚Äôs stylist requested samples from his Paris showroom earlier this month. He sent a range of looks and was quickly asked to produce the bespoke designs for the popular royal couple‚Äôs Aussie tour.  ‚ÄúThey said they loved them, so we asked for a few measurements and turned it around quite quickly‚Äîin a matter of five to 10 days,‚Äù Grant said. He was unfazed, despite his newest customer‚Äôs high profile. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre used to doing that for other celebrities,‚Äù he said.  Grant's celebrity following includes names Cate Blanchett, Tilda Swinton, Emma Stone and Blake Lively.  The 37-year-old Duchess, whose first pregnancy was announced earlier this week, looked radiant in Grant‚Äôs maxi dress on Friday when he and the Prince met the OneWave surfing community support group on Bondi Beach to discuss mental health issues. The couple kicked off their shoes and chilled on the sand, joining in on the colorfully dressed group‚Äôs ‚Äúanti-bad-vibe circle‚Äù.   Grant, who is coincidentally home in Australia during the royal tour, said the casual and summery dress was a perfect choice for Australia‚Äôs most iconic beach.  ‚ÄúThe dress is not designed as a pregnancy dress but it‚Äôs early on‚Äîshe‚Äôs not really showing‚Äîso it works well. I‚Äôm very flattered because she‚Äôs a gorgeous girl and she‚Äôs got good taste and good style.‚Äù  As for Grant‚Äôs 100 percent cotton trench, the former Suits actress wore it on outings in both Sydney and Melbourne‚Äîproving she recycles clothes just like the rest of us.   ‚ÄúI love the fact she wore it twice,‚Äù said Grant. ‚ÄúIt shows a certain reality and it‚Äôs a classic, neutral piece that can be worn with different styles and shoes. Australians are relaxed, so this makes her more accessible‚Äîand less intimidating.‚Äù  The Melbourne-born designer, who has been based in Paris for 26 years, has been enjoying the Meghan Markle buzz while visiting family back home this week. ‚ÄúI do hope to meet her in the near future but nothing is planned,‚Äù he said. 
 No fashion show gets in the way of sisterly love. Not even an It model like Gigi Hadid can escape a wardrobe malfunction during fashion week. While walking for the Anna Sui show tonight at NYFW, the 22-year-old hit the runway in a bohemian-chic ensemble‚Äîcomplete with a feathered shawl, sequined dress, necklace, and sheer socks‚Äîbut one of her shoes was missing.  Nevertheless, the model strutted on, unfazed. Hadid's platform sandals didn't look easy to walk in with only half of the pair, but she carried on like a professional, while tiptoeing on her right foot to keep her balance. Gigi Hadid lost a shoe and I barely noticed #Professional @annasui pic.twitter.com/qEBeId2KUA During the final walk, however, her little sister stepped in.  Bella (literally) supported her big sis to keep her from falling, and they closed the show together. No fashion show can get in the way of this strong sister bond.  This is what sibling ‚ù§Ô∏è looks like. @YolandaHFoster did a killer job with @GiGiHadid and @bellahadid!! pic.twitter.com/94dtvVXmnD We don't know what exactly happened to Gigi's other shoe, but it doesn't matter. Honestly, she didn't even need it.
 And she was joined by Lady Kitty Spencer and Ashley Graham. Taking place on Lake Como in Italy, Dolce & Gabbana's Alta Moda show featured a whole host of familiar faces, but it was supermodel Naomi Campbell that stole the show on this occasion. Helena Christensen, Ashley Graham, and Lady Kitty Spencer were among the models also walking the runway for Dolce & Gabbana. But it was Campbell's decadent gown, stunning feathered headdress, and elegant accompanying soundtrack which drew everyone's attention to her as she walked:   Princess Diana's niece, Lady Kitty Spencer looked flawless at the show as she posed alongside Emma Thynn, the Viscountess Weymouth, Domenico Dolce, and Stefano Gabbana: This isn't the first time that royals and aristocrats have walked the runway for Dolce & Gabbana, either. Back in February 2018, the brand assembled a regal runway, including Lady Kitty Spencer and Lady Violet Manners for their "Secrets & Diamonds" show. Ashley Graham also walked in the show at Lake Como, however according to reports, not all of her fans were happy about her taking part, following Gabbana's very vocal criticism regarding Selena Gomez.  Just last month, Gabbana commented on a photo of Gomez on Instagram and wrote in Italian, "√à proprio brutta!‚Äù which roughly translates as "she‚Äôs really ugly!" You can view screenshots of the offensive exchange here. Actress Jennifer Tilly shared footage of the jaw-dropping event writing on Twitter, "A little precision to start your day!" in reference to the show's incredible choreography:  A little precision to start your day! @dolcegabbana #AltaModa #DGLovesComo #Italy pic.twitter.com/qj3ut4IA1q 
 Do you see what we see? üëÄ Kendall Jenner and Emily Ratajkowski both showed up to Wednesday night's Philadelphia 76ers vs. San Antonio Spurs game in Philly wearing matching black ribbed turtlenecks. Both models stayed true to their unique taste in fashion. Kendall's style preference leans clean, simple, and tailored, mixed with streetwear vibes, while Emily's favorite looks are Southern California cool, with plenty of dresses and tops that show off her d√©colletage, along with leg-baring bottoms.   
  Although they did not sit together for the game‚ÄîEmily was spotted cozying up to her husband, Sebastian Bear-McClard, next to Josh Ostrovsky (AKA social media personality @thefatjewish) and Kendall was by herself‚Äîthey both sat court-side, which gave us a great look at how the two models like to style the classic black sweater.  Emily wore the simple-yet-versatile wardrobe staple as a mini dress and elevated the look with minimal jewelry.  She also played with texture by adding a pair of eye-catching teal crocodile-effect knee-high boots, along with a neutral snakeskin-print waist bag, which gave her overall look an edge. Ratajkowski recently celebrated her husband's birthday, by posting a succinct and lovely post on her Instagram where she said: "HBD, husband. I love you more every day."   HBD, husband. I love you more every day. A post shared by  Emily Ratajkowski (@emrata) on Jan 21, 2019 at 6:05am PST  The two were reportedly in the same friend group for years, and on February 23, 2018, the couple had a surprise civil ceremony at City Hall in Manhattan. Only a few family members and friends (including the groom's BFF Josh Ostrovsky) were at the nuptials. Kendall Jenner, who's rumored to be dating 76ers player Ben Simmons, wore her sweater with a pair of tonal leather pants that showed off her 5'10" frame. She finished the look with gold-tone hoop earrings and midnight blue nail polish.  One interesting accessory Kendall sported that evening was the same black and multicolor, monogram-coated Mini HL Speedy handbag from Louis Vuitton that big sister Kim gifted "all of the baby girls in the fam," including 11-month-old Stormi Webster.   Within the last ten days, this is the third 76ers game Kendall has attended, presumably to watch Simmons play ball. Although KJ would like to keep her relationships private ("If I'm not fully, fully in it with someone, why would I make it public to everyone else?"), she did reciprocate Ben's flirty advances on Instagram.  Two weeks ago, Simmons commented "Come here .."  on a 'gram of Kendall posing in a bikini in a studio, and she simply responded with the race car and gust emojis letting Ben (and her Insta followers) know that she's ready and on her way over to meet him. Although we don't know for sure when she'll show up to Ben's next game, we do know that the 76ers play the Denver Nuggets on Saturday night at 9 PM, so we'll be keeping our eyes peeled for more of Kendall's stylish looks. In the meantime, scroll through the gallery below featuring Kendall's full style evolution.

 The Obsessed actress is scoring major style points in her chic ensemble.   This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. Actress and cookbook author Ali Larter has us dreaming of our next oceanside vacation. The Final Destination actress stepped out in a stylish navy blue cover-up with white piping for an afternoon at a Los Angeles beach. Her tailored minidress from BASK is made of Turkish terry velour, and can also be worn as a chic double-breasted blazer. She is also sporting a pair of delicate leaf earrings from Alexandra Jules.    She previously twinned with fellow actress, author, and model Molly Sims. In an adorable birthday shout-out on her Instagram, Larter uploaded a picture featuring the two friends standing in front of a lake sporting their Great Gatsby-inspired pieces over their bikinis.   HBD, you Southern bell! You are a fierce working woman, a loving and dedicated mother, a devoted friend, and one hell of a good time. I‚Äôll mug with you anyday. I hope you have the most beautiful day surrounded by those that adore you! üíù @mollybsims A post shared by  Ali Larter (@alilarter) on May 25, 2019 at 10:02am PDT Sims rocked the navy version while Larter switched it up and went for a pale blue option. Although the double-duty cover-up retails for $335 and can be monogrammed, you can also borrow her blazer in black from Rent the Runway for $55. The retailer also has two similar versions in navy with light blue or red trim for $50 and $45, respectively.  
  Gaining favor with the preps in Nantucket, Martha's Vineyard, and Palm Beach, alongside a crop of Hollywood starlets, this classic look can quickly take you from the beach to your next clambake. And with only two more days until the Fourth of July, this smart fashion staple still has time to potentially become the next big summer trend.

 Rag & Bone and Prabal Gurung won't show at Hudson Yards following developer Stephen Ross's Trump fundraiser. Two designers have decided not to show at the high-end retail and leisure space Hudson Yards during New York Fashion Week next month after the venue's developer, Stephen Ross, hosted a fundraiser for President Trump's reelection. Rag & Bone will no longer present its spring 2020 collection at The Shed, an event space on the Hudson Yards grounds expected to be NYFW's next home base, a source close to the brand told WWD. The brand hasn't announced a new location yet. Similarly, Prabal Gurung announced that he canceled plans to show at The Vessel (the Yards' honeycomb-like influencer hot spot) as he denounced Ross's involvement with Trump on Twitter last week. He's headed to Spring Studios instead, per WWD. "My goal here is to start a dialogue and maybe, hopefully, change some minds," Gurung said in a string of tweets last Wednesday. "I was previously in conversation with Hudson Yards' The Vessel as the venue for my brand's upcoming 10 year show during NYFW. When I heard about this fundraiser, I chose to pull my participation." 8/10: We hadn‚Äôt confirmed anything yet, however we were in direct contact and conversation with the team there and we were keen to partner. The team we were talking to has been wonderful to work with, so I do not wish to implicate the individuals who are simply doing their jobs The brands' distancing themselves from Hudson Yards is the latest of boycotts against Ross and his companies, which include Equinox, SoulCycle, and Blink Fitness, in the wake of the Trump fundraising news first reported by The Washington Post. Designer Dana Lorenz of Fallon Jewelry, even pulled out of the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA), which organizes NYFW, because Ross's wife, jewelry designer Kara Ross, is on the board. The CFDA declined to comment.  "Yesterday, while Mrs. Ross was putting finishing touches on her Trump fundraiser, I was making sure my sobbing housekeeper had her entire family's documents in order, a woman with 3 years citizenship living in fear," Lorenz wrote on Instagram.  Following the outrage, billionaire real estate developer Ross said in a statement that he'll speak out when he disagrees with the president and considers himself "an outspoken champion of racial equality, inclusion, diversity, public education and environmental sustainability." However, that hasn't stopped people‚Äîincluding celebrities‚Äîfrom canceling their memberships with his affiliated gyms.  Ross hosted one of two fundraisers for Trump in the Hamptons on Friday. Together, both events raised $12 million for the incumbent, according to a tweet from Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel. For the gathering at Ross's home, tickets cost $100,000 for a "photo opportunity and lunch," and $250,000 for "the package that includes the roundtable discussion" with the president, according to the invite obtained by The Washington Post.    Fashion Week is no stranger to protests; if anything, it's become a stage for designers to get political through clothing, whether it's with Women's March pussy hats, parody Trump merchandise, feminist slogans, Planned Parenthood pins, or anti-Kavanaugh tees. With NYFW quickly approaching (the five-day event starts September 6), who else will use their platform to speak out?  BAZAAR.com has reached out to The Shed for comment.
 Welcome to the Dior Circus.  Since her appointment as Dior's first female creative director, Maria Grazia Chiuri has delved into the worlds of ballet, 1960s protests, and even rodeos for inspiration on the runway. But for the fashion house's Spring 2019 Haute Couture collection, Chiuri entered new territory with a full-on Dior Circus.  The show, which was held inside an actual circus tent (complete with the Dior logo), took inspiration from the "fantastical creative chaos" of the age-old form of entertainment. There were nods to clowns and jesters, but most stunning was the live acrobatic performance that unfolded. As models walked the runway, a troupe of acrobats from the all-female circus company Mimbre performed alongside the looks. Forming a human archway and various other stunts, the acrobats donned black and white playsuits as they weaved in and out of the collection's looks.   Kicking off the #DiorDreamParade that represented the unveiling of the Dior Spring-Summer 2019 Haute Couture collection by #MariaGraziaChiuri, model @SelenaForrest, a firm House favorite, wearing an asymmetric navy silk velvet cocktail dress with ruffled sailor collar, entered the circus tent show space by passing beneath a human arch provided by @MimbreAcrobats, the all-female acrobatic troupe whose performance punctuated the show.  #DiorCouture A post shared by  Dior Official (@dior) on Jan 22, 2019 at 1:01am PST Featuring women standing on each other's shoulders as a means of support, the all-female performance stood as a symbolic performance of the women-first mentality Chiuri brought with her to Dior. Since making her debut in a "We Should All Be Feminists" slogan t-shirt, the designer has used the runway to celebrate female artists in various ways over the past few seasons.  But the fashion house also has a long-history with the circus. Christian Dior himself often frequented the Cirque d'Hiver for inspiration, which is where Richard Avedon took his iconic photo, 'Dovima and the Elephants,' in 1955. In her show notes, Chiuri called the photo "an image that perfectly evokes the wonder and majesty of haute couture."  "The circus is presented as a place of inclusion in which the clown, through its androgynous and asexual dimension, becomes the expression of a possible equality and an evocation of modernity‚Äîone where beauty, origin, gender and age are no longer important, and only technique and daring matter," the show notes concluded.

 The swimwear and resort brand partnered with Every Mother Counts on a new, cute collab. "Mommy and me" fashion should be its own category now, like denim or suiting‚Äîexcept everything is available in both the original design and a mini version. What stylish moment doesn't benefit from "twinning" though, really? Many brands are catching onto the theme, but Onia is taking "mommy and me" a step further by acknowledging that safety for mothers in childbirth isn't one-size-fits-all. Today, the lounge, swim, and lifestyle brand released a collection of feminine, floral one-pieces in partnership with Every Mother Counts, the charity founded by supermodel Christy Turlington-Burns.  According to the non-profit organization, "Every day, 800 women will not survive pregnancy and childbirth, and thousands more will suffer from long-term disabilities." "While I am fortunate to have safely delivered three healthy babies, women around the world face tremendous hardships in their journey toward becoming a mother," Dalia Cunow, Onia's women's creative director tells BAZAAR.com. "I learned about Every Mother Counts through my obstetrician Dr. Jacques Moritz. Dr Moritz helped Christy Turlington-Burns through a life threatening child-birth complication inspiring her to found EMC. EMC is a non-profit dedicated to making childbirth safe and respectful for every mother, everywhere. I am in awe of the work they do and sought out a way to support this amazing organization."  50% of the sales from each of the matching Onia styles‚Äî"Kelly" for grown-ups ($195) and "Ava" ($75) for girls sizes 2-10‚Äîwill be donated to the organization.

 For those who miss Phoebe just a little too much, we found some very chic alternatives Who knew fashion people were so nostalgic?  Fashion is an industry that is rooted in the future‚Äîwith a seemingly constant stream of new collections and fixations on pieces that won't be available for months. But the departure of Phoebe Philo from C√©line, which was announced in December of 2017, sent forward-thinking fashion folk into a spiral. The Instagram handle Old Celine, with only 63 posts to date, has 206,000 followers and counting; meanwhile the #oldceline hashtag has been used 22,000 times. There may have been a few tears shed‚Äîsome over the loss of an accent over the first e in Celine. People are not over it, and we get it, Philo is a unique talent and her contributions have been missed. But she was also highly influential, inspiring generation of new designers with her signature clean aesthetic. So as we enter yet another Phoebe-free season, let's look ahead and shop the designers who help you get that #oldceline vibe from their own, fresh perspective‚Äîfrom familiar faces, to C√©line alumni, and up-and-comers.  Daniel Lee served as C√©line's director of ready-to-wear under Phoebe Philo for five years before taking on the role of creative director at Bottega Veneta. The parallels with #oldceline are clear, and while Lee shares a luxe sensibility, his first collection for the house marries a minimal sensibility with an Italian sensuality in a way that feels entirely fresh.  SHOP NOW Amy Smilovic is a seasoned, celebrated designer in her own right. Her collections are filled with interesting, cool pieces that have the soul of what women want to look like and¬†what their¬†lifestyles actually entail at heart.¬† This Aussie designer doesn't stick with the status quo‚Äîpushing the boundaries of what "minimalist" means with an attention to unique fabrications and interesting structure. Another Aussie, Anna Quan has been a hit on social media for her particular brand of basics that add that extra something special. This Scandi mainstay has never been out of our sights, but designer  Jonny Johansson's most recent collection for Fall 2019 was such a smash that it serves as a reminder to not always be on the lookout for everything new, but to trust that your go-tos can really knock it out of the park‚Äîor the Palais de Tokyo (where the show walked) in Paris. SHOP NOW This New York-based label was founded by¬†Catherine Holstein in 2016 and answers the call for sleek, understated fashion with a feminine bent. It's American sportswear executed with a modern eye. Doubtlessly you're already¬†familiar with The Row, but lest you forget all of those double-faced cashmeres, perfect leather trousers, and highly collectible¬†bags, let this serve as your reminder. You're welcome.¬† Creative Director Yuni Ahn is also an alumnus of Philo's C√©line who has taken her talents on the road. Ahn debuted her first collection for the French brand, entitled "House Kitsune," for Fall 2019. Its melding of streetwear meets sporty meets Saville Row meets workwear is made all the more intriguing thanks to its approachable price point.  This FIT grad also worked under Philo at C√©line. A bit of a wunderkind, his newly-launched label has already been picked up by Net-a-Porter. Do has an eye for color and isn't afraid to play with shape, while keeping his pieces incredibly wearable. If you're blindly searching for wonderfully tailored trousers, incredible fabrications put to work on elegant clothing, and accessories with an unexpected twist,¬†look no further than Gabriela Hearst.¬†The New Yorker¬†also designs sustainably and has a keen eye for form and structure. And when the nostalgia just gets to be too much, a girl can always hit up the resale market and get a hit of #oldceline via a chic second-hand bag.¬†
 Fyre Fest x NYFW? Earlier this week, designer Philipp Plein sent out invitations for his Fall 2019/Winter 2020 runway show at New York Fashion Week, but in classic Plein fashion, it stacked up to be bigger than any other presentation. The event promised to be an extravagant spectacle: a "Billionaire"-themed black-tie-dinner-meets-runway-show with, most importantly, a performance by Kanye West. Big-time musical performers are nothing new for Plein's catwalks. Snoop Dogg, Fergie, and Future have all taken the mic at his shows in recent seasons. However, this time was different. Kanye didn't even know he landed the gig‚Äîbecause the person who booked him wasn't even a part of his team.  "We were beyond excited to work with [Kanye West] but unfortunately an individual pretended to be part of his management team and acted without Kanye‚Äôs knowledge, capitalizing on a former friendship with him," Philipp Plein International confirmed in a statement today. "Unfortunately we too were affected by this misrepresentation." West will no longer be performing at Plein's fashion show, which is still scheduled to run on Monday, February 11. "We have recently been in contact with Kanye's official team and are releasing this statement in unison to clarify that there has not been any misconduct on any of our parts," the brand added. "We hope to collaborate with Kanye West in the future and we look forward to our 20th Anniversary show this Monday evening."  West's wife, Kim Kardashian, previously hinted at the performance mixup on Twitter two days ago. When one fan tweeted that West was "rumored to be performing at Philipp Plein," the reality star swiftly shut down the gossip. "He‚Äôs not performing at any fashion show this season. Just a rumor," she responded.   He‚Äôs not performing at any fashion show this season. Just a rumor https://t.co/QcnO1ObEnC  TMZ first reported the West-Plein mixup earlier today, adding that the fake Kanye rep who organized the deal allegedly forged the rapper's signature on the contract and pocketed a $900,000 advance. The brand has not confirmed those details. However, it's not unusual for Plein's shows to run a big check. The New York Times reported in 2015 that the budget for one show was $2.8 million.

 I'm broke just looking at this collection. Moschino's long-awaited collaboration with H&M is almost upon us, and we finally have out first look at the incredible ad campaign featuring Gigi Hadid. In a series of new photos revealed by WWD, we get to see the color palette of H&M's Moschino collection. Featuring silver, gold, and sparkly fabrics, contrasted with a lot of neutral colors, you're probably going to want all of the striking pieces, which will be available from November 8. But as with H&M's other collaborations with fashion designers, the items are likely to sell out very quickly.   We told you there would be a lot of patterns, gold and sparkle in this collection, didn't we? ‚ú® #HMOSCHINO @moschino A post shared by  H&M (@hm) on Oct 5, 2018 at 9:00am PDT  Gigi Hadid is central to the collection, and famously helped Jeremy Scott announce the collaboration via video chat, back at Coachella back in April 2018.

 Into the woods with Chanel.  From airports to space stations, grocery stores and beyond, Chanel has taken its runways far and wide over the years.  For its Fall 2018 show today, the fashion house got in touch with nature with a dark and moody forest-themed runway. Transforming the Grand Palais into the woods, here's everything to know from this morning's Chanel show at Paris Fashion Week.  Taking the season quite literally, the Chanel set embraced fall in every way possible‚Äîfrom leaf-covered invitations to leaf-covered floors. Karl Lagerfeld transformed Paris' Grand Palais into a lifelike forest complete with tall trees that lined the runway and a backdrop that seemed to extend the Chanel forest infinitely.   Good morning from @chanelofficial! Last day! Watch the first half on my live now, babies! üçÅ #fromtinaslap #pfw #nailswithtina A post shared by  Tina Leung Ê¢Å‰ºäÂ¶Æ (@tinaleung) on Mar 6, 2018 at 2:40am PST  A forest imagined by Karl Lagerfeld sets the tone for the #CHANELFallWinter 2018/19 show as the Grand Palais opens its doors. #PFW A post shared by  CHANEL (@chanelofficial) on Mar 6, 2018 at 1:16am PST Lagerfeld muses including Carla Bruni, Lily Allen and Keira Knightley all sat front row at the Fall 2018 show. Notably missing this season were Chanel regulars Lily-Rose Depp, Cara Delevingne and Pharrell Williams.  As for the collection itself, models paraded through piles of leaves in an astounding total of 80 fall-ready looks that varied from Chanel's classic tweed to fur coats, black lace gowns and oversized scarves.   @chanelofficial into the forest with just the right attitude for f/w 2018 üçÇüçÅüêøüçÅ üëèüèªüëèüèª A post shared by  Nina Garcia (@ninagarcia) on Mar 6, 2018 at 3:11am PST While the show opened with an array of predominantly neutral looks in shades of black and gray, bright hues of blue, orange and pink were woven into the collection in the form of fingerless opera-length gloves and scarves.  The final twelve looks all featured black lace dresses paired with colorful statement-making gloves done in bright, unexpected shades of leather. Amongst those in the contrasting look was supermodel-in-the-making Kaia Gerber, who hit the runway in a black lace mini dress, pink leather gloves and mismatched earrings featuring the brand's double C logo.  Standing out against the dark and moody fall backdrop were the colorful lineup of fingerless gloves‚Äîa nod to Karl Lagerfeld's signature accessory, perhaps? In-between, there were plays on the brand's signature tweed, chubby fur coats and quilted Chanel puffers‚Äîall making for plenty of outerwear options.  One thing's for sure: the Chanel woman is set to be bundled up in style during her many walks through the woods next season. But she won't be blending in with those colorful leather gloves.

 Goosebumps.  Prabal Gurung is known for his inspiring, inclusive, and powerful runways during New York Fashion Week‚Äîand his Fall 2018 show last night was no exception.   Backstage, the mood was set for models walking the show with empowering posters reading positive mantras like "Your voice is your power: use it for justice" hanging on the walls. Furthering the feminist tone of the evening, the front row included #MeToo founder Tarana Burke (attending her first ever fashion show), Janet Mock, Laverne Cox, Whoopi Goldberg, Huma Abedin, and Cardi B.  As for the collection itself, the colorful lineup of clothing was inspired by powerful women from Gurung's home country of Nepal along with women-centric groups like India's Gulabi Gang and the Mosuo tribe of China. Pink, as it turns out, is a common color shared amongst these cultures.  The most powerful, goosebump-inducing moment of the show, however, came during the finale walk. The diverse cast of models walked the runway side by side, holding white flowers, with some linking arms. The moment drove home the designer's message that women are stronger together, and stronger in color.  Bella and Gigi Hadid both led and closed the walk, sharing a sweet moment of sisterhood with the two draping arms over each other's backs as the show ended.  For a show that celebrated the power of unity amongst women, it was the perfect way to close the runway. .@prabalgurung's women make a colorful statement #NYFW pic.twitter.com/TVoogVKTcK Of course, this is hardly Gurung's first time bringing feminism to NYFW. For Fall 2017, the designer staged an empowering finale in which every model walked the runway in statement-making feminist t-shirts reading things like "Nevertheless She Persisted" and "We Will Not Be Silenced." Last season, Gurung's show began with a voiceover of The Activist's prayer and also seated Gloria Steinem in the front row for her first fashion show. 
 Wearing just mesh underwear. Ashley Graham is the latest model to feature in LOVE's 2017 advent calendar, and her look is as fierce and flawless as you'd expect. Shot in black and white, Graham is shown wearing black mesh underwear as she sprints along the road. By the end of the video it's revealed that Graham is pulling a sled, which will get just about anyone into the Christmas spirit. Throughout the video, Graham's body looks incredible, and there are copious close-up shots of her breasts and butt, as the model prepares to run.  At the end of the video, a quote from Graham appears on screen saying, "Shooting the advent calendar is a true expression of self love... We are powerful, we are resilient, and we run the world." The video's release comes just after Graham denounced the term "plus-sized" on television. On CBS Sunday Morning, Graham said, "I think the word 'plus-sized' is so divisive to women. I think that when you use the word 'plus-size,' you‚Äôre putting all these women into a category." Graham's attitude, and her staunch belief that women should feel comfortable in their own skin regardless of their size, is constantly inspiring. Graham also took to task the misnomers associated with the term saying that people assume, "'You don‚Äôt eat well. You don‚Äôt work out. You couldn‚Äôt care less about your body. You‚Äôre insecure. You have no confidence.' And that is none of this." As her LOVE advent calendar appearance makes very clear, Graham is in incredible shape, and stronger than ever.

 üôåüôåüôå After months of leaks and rumors of a footwear collab, rapper Travis Scott officially confirmed on Instagram today that he's teaming up with Nike on some new designs.  "WORK-IN-PROGRESS," the Houston native announced in the caption. He also tagged #af1, hinting that he's designing a new iteration of the brand's signature Air Force 1 sneaker, pictured below. Scott's connections to the brand run deep. He previously starred in Nike campaign for its VaporMax sneaker in May. Plus, over the summer, he was seen teasing an unreleased Air Force 1 model (the "Cactus Jack," which features interchangeable swooshes) on social media. The rapper didn't officially announce what the upcoming collab entails yet, but according to leaked info, this sneaker model is one of them. This also appears to be the same shoe in his announcement post. .@trvisXX previews his "Cactus Jack" Nike Air Force 1 Low with interchangeable Swooshes. pic.twitter.com/gTnXKq9hXb Scott is one of the latest celebs to collaborate with Nike, including fellow rapper Kendrick Lamar, who worked on a Cortez sneaker with the sportswear brand. This also isn't his first time teaming up with a major label. Earlier this year, he released a capsule collection with Helmut Lang inspired by his Texan roots. 
 This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. Utterly unique, multi-faceted, and stronger than first impressions might have you believe, the correlation between woman and diamond is undeniable. To celebrate The Forevermark Tribute‚Ñ¢ Collection, we're sharing the stories of strong, accomplished women who are more than the sum of all their parts. On the spectrum of sisterhood, you see it all: women who are best, best friends and pairs that fight like cats and dogs. Nikki and Lola Ogunnaike are of the first variety, with a close-knit bond that's both personal and professional. The two are in the same industry, with Nikki as ELLE.com's style director and Lola as a pedigreed journalist and TV correspondent.  Mutual respect and constant support are both key to their relationship, with career and personal advice flowing back and forth between the pair. Along with reminding the other to celebrate the qualities that make her unique, both see importance in pausing to recognize the small moments that lead up to bigger accomplishments (and to engage in some self-gifting when appropriate). That focus on self-defined victories and a celebration of women's unique qualities are at the core of The Forevermark Tribute‚Ñ¢ Collection, a grouping of delicate pieces meant to be mixed, matched, stacked, and layered. Like all Forevermark diamonds, each one is selected after a rigorous process and is responsibly sourced. Watch Nikki and Lola's sister story above and explore the jewelry below.

 It's "your majesty" to you... Sometimes I feel like my everyday accessories don't actually represent the real me, the full me with a side of extra and a sprinkling of drama. Take my office chair for example. It's gray and black with a scratchy (well-worn) foam seat that doesn't tell you anything about me. It's not until you see my blue fluffy pen that you realize the kind of businesswoman you're dealing with. But thanks to Lit Headphones (that name though...) at least one of my everyday accessories can represent who I truly am inside. No longer will I have to settle on bland in-ear headphones because now I have a headphone crown that is fit for an actual queen.  Lit's Crown Headphones are available in six different colors, and TBH, I want every single pair. The only problem is I'm gonna need a queen's salary to afford them. White Queen Headphones, Lit Headphones, $299.99. SHOP Black Queen Headphones, Lit Headphones, $299.99. SHOP Red Reign Headphones, Lit Headphones, $299.99. SHOP Winter Green Headphones, Lit Headphones, $299.99. SHOP Royal Blue Headphones, Lit Headphones, $299.99. SHOP Winter Palace Headphones, Lit Headphones, $299.99.

 The brand's M√©tiers d‚ÄôArt show will take place at the Met.  Over the past few seasons, Chanel has staged its MeÃÅtiers d‚ÄôArt show in Hamburg, Rome, and of course, Paris. But this December, the French fashion house is bringing its jet-setting runway show to New York City's Metropolitan Museum of Art.  Taking place on December 4, Chanel's Pre-Fall 2019 collection will mark its first New York-based show since 2006. In fact, in its over-100 year history, the brand has only ever shown in New York twice before. The first time being in 2005 at its Fifth Avenue store (to coincide with its 2005 retrospective exhibition at The Met) and the second being a year later at Grand Central Station for its Resort 2007 collection.  According to a release from the brand, the show will be inspired by both founder Gabrielle Chanel and current creative director Karl Lagerfeld's connections to New York:  Following several seasons of designers opting to leave New York Fashion Week to instead show in other European cities, Lagerfeld's return to New York could perhaps inspire other fashion houses to follow suit. Similarly, Prada opted to show its Resort 2019 collection in New York this past May.

 His work with '90s supermodels changed the course of fashion photography forever.  Peter Lindbergh, the renowned photographer whose work helped launch the era of '90s supermodels, passed away on Tuesday at the age of 74, his family confirmed in an official Instagram post this morning.  Lindbergh was behind the lens of some of fashion's most iconic imagery, from his signature black-and-white portraits of supers like Naomi, Kate, and Linda to the Pirelli Calendar. His vision redefined fashion photography as a whole, ushering in an era of natural beauty captured in raw portraits that highlighted women in a new light. During a time of airbrushing, he was known for his strong stance against retouching photos.  The photographer was behind some of Harper's BAZAAR's most iconic images as well‚Äîfrom the '90s supers shot as angels to striking monochromatic portraits and cinematic imagery. His photographs of Linda Evangelista, Christy Turlington, Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell, and Kate Moss helped cement their status as icons.  Lindbergh was born in German-occupied Poland in 1944 and grew up in Duisburg, Germany. He studied art at the Berlin Academy of Fine Arts and the Krefeld College of Art before opening his own photography studio in 1973. After moving to Paris to pursue fashion photography, his career of international acclaim soon began.  His works went on to be featured in magazines across the world from BAZAAR to Vogue and campaigns for fashion houses from Dior to Donna Karan.  He was the only photographer to shoot the prestigious Pirelli Calendar three times‚Äîin 1996, 2002, and most recently in 2017. The prolific photographer's images were celebrated in the 2016 book, Peter Lindbergh: A Different Vision on Fashion Photography, and the recently published coffee-table book, Peter Lindbergh: Shadows on the Wall. The photographer is survived by his wife, Petra; his first wife, Astrid; his four sons, Benjamin, J√©r√©my, Simon, Joseph; and seven grandchildren. 
 She did not one, but two dips on the runway. We've seen some sassy and powerful runway walks this NYFW so far, but none can quite compare to this jaw-dropping entrance by Leiomy Maldonado at the Disney Villains x The Blonds' show on Friday night. The Bronx-bred dancer, renowned for her work in the voguing dance style, strutted down the catwalk like she owned every last inch of it. 
  Maldonado started out with a sultry power-walk (which was impressive enough to begin with), but once she got halfway down the runway, she started busting out the moves. At the end of the catwalk, she didn't settle for an ordinary spin; she did a dip.  And no, she did not stop dancing on her way back up the runway, because a true queen commits. She also threw in some twirls and yet another dip before strutting her way backstage.  Excuse us while we gasp frantically for air. While tearing up the runway, Maldonado sported a sequined, studded, and spiked leotard from The Blonds' Spring 2019 collection, which was inspired by Disney villains. Leiomy's purple look, which included some voluminously furry shoulder accents, took after The Little Mermaid's Ursula.  Other famous faces in the show included Paris Hilton (who resembled Cruella de Vil) and beauty YouTuber Patrick Starrr.  This might not have been the first time you've been mesmerized by Leiomy's fierce presence. Last year, she was featured in Nike's #BeTrue campaign during Pride Month, and was the first transgender person to star in the brand's ads after Chris Mosier, the first trans athlete to join a men's U.S. National Team. More recently, she starred as Florida Ferocity in Pose, Ryan Murphy's new show inspired by the Ballroom Scene, which boasts the largest number of transgender actors in a TV series. Keep slaying, Leiomy. This post has been updated.

 While we love our designer sunglasses, these lesser-known brands are worth discovering too.  No matter what the season, we‚Äôre always looking for new sunglasses to top off our look. But now that summer‚Äôs quickly approaching, that gives us all the more reason and excuse to amp up our shade collection. While we love our classic designer frames from Celine to Tom Ford and Ray-Ban, it‚Äôs always fun discovering more under-the-radar accessory brands too. From the cool new designers taking over Instagram to the smaller labels continuing to rise, these are the lesser-known sunglasses brands to shop in 2019.  From oversized geometric shades to bright colors and materials, Lapima was made for those who like to have fun with their accessories. Founded by husband and wife duo¬†Gisela and Gustavo Assis, this Brazilian brand's sunglasses are all handmade by local artisans¬†in¬†S√£o Paulo, which makes them feel just as special as their bubbly, avant-garde designs.¬† Putting a philanthropic twist to your sunnies, this San Francisco-based brand often partners with non-profit organizations to donate a portion of proceeds to a cause. With a range of classic styles benefitting Teach for America, a collaboration with Olivia Palermo benefitting Dress for Success, and a¬†SPORT line¬†that supports the Ladies First organization, these are sunglasses you can feel good about shopping. If you hadn't heard of Carolina Lemke before, chances are¬†Kim Kardashian West's collection likely put the brand on your radar with its futuristic and sporty styles.¬†The Berlin-based designer has a mix of trendy, sporty, and classic shades that are affordably-priced, with most styles ranging from $80 to $100.¬† F√©roce¬†just launched in April, but it's already catching our attention with its cool, yet minimal styles. The new direct-to-consumer brand (which literally translates to "fierce" in French)¬†offers up high quality handmade materials from Italy, with all styles retailing at $110.¬† There‚Äôs a reason this brand has quickly become a favorite amongst fashion's It girls. With ultra-tiny '80s and¬†‚Äò90s-inspired frames and a range of playful colors, Roberi & Fraud has some of the coolest frames of the moment.¬† Launched in 2013, this New Orleans-based brand uses its native Southern city as inspiration for its eyewear. Featuring 24K gold detailing, handmade frames, and a lifetime guarantee policy, the quality of Krewe's sunglasses is next level. Its frames have been spotted on a growing list of celebrities from Selena Gomez to Gigi Hadid, Blake Lively, and even Beyonc√©. This '90s-inspired brand counts Rihanna as one of its biggest fans‚Äîand for good reason. Its oversized cat eyes and cool color combinations make it a playful choice for any fashion risk-taker. Offering a range of eccentric and unique frame options,¬†Poppy Lissiman¬†is a rising accessory designer to watch. The Australian brand's pieces are all handcrafted from vegan or faux leather materials and already count both Gigi and Bella Hadid as fans. Komono takes a minimalist approach when it comes to sunglasses. The brand is worth checking out for its sleek and streamlined styles that are chic without trying too hard‚Äîor feeling too trendy. From ultra-feminine cat-eye sunglasses to retro round frames,¬†Sunday Somewhere's range of sunnies are effortlessly cool. The brand offers both men and women's along with optical styles as well. You've likely already seen the Adam Selman x Le Specs cat-eye sunglasses that have taken over Instagram time and time again. But the brand's range of cool sunnies goes way beyond that‚Äîand its styles¬†all range under $130.¬† Although Smoke x Mirrors was launched out of New York in 2014, all of its frames are handcrafted in France. With a variety of frames, color options, and playful prints, this brand doesn't follow the trends but instead, creates its own. With Oliver Peoples' founder Larry Leight as is father, it's no surprise that Garrett Leight knows a thing or two about good eyewear. This quality crafted brand is based out of Venice Beach, California and also allows shoppers to customize their own pair of sunglasses from frame to lens and finish.¬† After collaborations with everyone from J.Lo to Kylie Jenner,¬†chances are you've probably already heard of Quay sunglasses, or at least scrolled past them on your Instagram feed.

 But you better act fast.    Even before marrying Prince Harry in May, Meghan Markle had already mastered the art of getting her outfits to sell out immediately. In fact, the jeans Markle wore for the couple's first public outing together at the Invictus Games last September not only sold out, they also amassed a waitlist of nearly 4,000 people.  The coveted skinny blue jeans, by American denim brand Mother, feature a frayed ankle-cut hemline and a subtle rip in the knee. And after months  of being waitlisted, the brand finally restocked Meghan's "Looker Ankle Fray" jeans in the color "Love Gun," for those who still want to channel the now-Duchess of Sussex's casual look. Mother jeans, $228, motherdenim.com. SHOP NOW Though nearly every item that Markle has worn publicly since the start of her relationship with Prince Harry has sold out, her effect on the Mother jeans was exponential. After the style initially sold out, the brand has since reported a 900% increase in the waitlist along with a 1,000% increase in site traffic to the landing page of Meghan's "Love Gun" jeans‚Äîproving the depth of the new royal's retail influence.  Mother previously restocked Markle's jeans back in March, before the royal wedding, and the style quickly sold out in three days. Though given the post-royal wedding obsession with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, it's unlikely the jeans will last that long this time around‚Äîthe Meghan Effect seemingly isn't slowing down any time soon.   The royal's "Looker Ankle Fray" jeans are now available to shop online across the globe.

 Take a tour of the environmentally-conscious and beautiful space, won't you...  Gabriela Hearst‚Äîshe of the mile-long bag waitlists‚Äîhas put down brick and mortar roots in New York's Upper East side at Carlyle House (985 Madison Avenue). The sustainably-designed, sun-soaked space uses natural, non-treated reclaimed oak and marble parquet damier floors. In keeping with her ethically designed collections, 90 percent of the material waste generated during the construction process was recycled. The neutral-toned boutique features custom furniture designed in-house and the seating was made in collaboration with Autoban. Each material used in the jewel box of a store was chosen with care and a conscience, and there's no denying that ladies will inevitable find their way to that wall of bags. As they say, get in line. Take a tour below.  "It was always part of the dream to have a store," Hearst explains. "The main goal for our first flagship was to create a luxury environment that was done in a conscious way because my belief is that luxury should be sustainable." The store is constructed with no synthetic fibers and no chemically treated materials.  On the wall hangs a handmade quilt by Phoebe Apperson Hearst from the late 1800s featuring a herringbone pattern that has been part of the brand detailing from the start. Those famed wait-listed bags. The handbag room at the back of the store room connects directly to the CarlyleHotel, for easy access to the New York institution.  "We took no shortcuts," adds Hearst. "We wanted to create a place that is inviting, inspiring and authentic." "Every piece of furniture is made by hand by Italian craftsmen, in Italy and on site," reveals Hearst. The store has two fitting rooms, each equipped with custom mirrors, lighting, silk panel walls and fixtures. The pullout drawers containing knits and footwear are made from recycled handcrafted oak wood and quilted hand-stitched herringbone detail on the pulls. The focal point of the store is a large u-shaped cashmere sofa‚Äîin case you need a break from shopping the only home of all of Gabriela Hearst's ready to wear, shoes, bags and accessories.
 And people are furious.  Forever 21 customers who ordered clothes online this week were furious to find something extra in their packages: Atkins bars. The fast fashion retailer has come under fire for sending the diet bars to its customers‚Äîmost of whom were shopping the brand's plus-size offerings‚Äîas a "special promotion."  Unimpressed customers took to Twitter to share photos of the unsolicited Atkins bar sample that came with their online orders.   I went from a size 24 to 18, still a plus size girl, so I ordered jeans from @Forever21 Opened the package, when I looked inside I see this Atkins bar. What are you trying to Tell me Forever 21, I‚Äôm FAT, LOSE WEIGHT? do you give these to NON-PLUS SIZE WOMEN as well? pic.twitter.com/ds8kUTs7T7 Hey @forever21 do you include weightloss Atkin bars in all your shipments or just in the ones for ladies over 1X ?? pic.twitter.com/ldajPJ81NM  One Twitter user called Forever 21's offering a "wildly dangerous message" to send to its customers, adding, "Not only is it fat-shaming, it could also trigger people of all sizes who have EDs."  Apparently @Forever21 sends out Atkins bars with all of its orders, which sends a wildly dangerous message to ALL of its customers. Not only is it fatshaming, it could also trigger people of all sizes who have EDs. This is as dangerous as it is inappropriate. https://t.co/gPfr3jMUK4 Another called the brand's move "fat-phobic, insensitive, and harmful to everyone involved."  Forever 21 responded with a statement, writing, ‚ÄúFrom time to time, Forever 21 surprises our customers with free test products from third parties in their e-commerce orders. The freebie items in question were included in all online orders, across all sizes and categories, for a limited time and have since been removed. This was an oversight on our part and we sincerely apologize for any offense this may have caused to our customers, as this was not our intention in any way.‚Äù Though the brand claims the Atkins bars were sent to customers "across all sizes," the oversight remains a dangerous one for women of any size. Sending unsolicited diet bars to anyone could be a trigger for body dysmorphia and eating disorders, and all brands‚Äîespecially those that target young women‚Äîshould be aware of this. There is no room for "oversights" like this from fashion brands anymore. 
 You'll be tempted to test the limits of Casual Friday. Good news, Parachute fans‚Äîthe cult-favorite bedding brand best known for its cotton and linen bedding (not to mention quality pillows, duvet inserts, a brand new mattress as of 2019, and the coziest cashmere robe you'll ever wear) has just made its first foray into silk. And sleepwear. Yep, that's right: Parachute is now selling silk pajamas, and they're as dreamy as they sound. As part of a limited edition capsule collection with A.L.C., a women's clothing brand founded by Andrea Lieberman, Parachute is now offering silk pajama sets in two colorways (blush, and striped), as well as silk pillowcase sets (in blush and white), a black and white silk robe featuring embroidered palm trees on the back, and of course, a silk eye mask. While robes are nothing new to the Parachute catalog, pajamas‚Äîand silk in general‚Äîdefinitely are.  As far as silk pajamas and robes go, they're basically the ultimate in luxury for lounging around, and would even make a great gift (that sleep mask especially!). But those silk pillowcases are an especially great addition to the Parachute catalog. If you're not already familiar with the benefits of using a silk or satin pillowcase, or you haven't made the switch yet, it's worth noting that they're more than just a way to up the luxe factor of your bed. Silk pillowcases can help protect your hair from damage and breakage, not to mention your skin from breakouts and irritation, thanks to the material's lack of friction while you're sleeping on it. (You can read more about that here.) The new silk capsule collection is now available to shop online at Parachute as well as at A.L.C., and you can find it in stores at both brands' brick-and-mortar locations, too.

Season after season you've probably seen countless street style photos of editors, models, celebrities dressed to the nines for fashion week‚Äîwhether in New York or Paris.

 Gigi Hadid has already been spotted sporting the collection ahead of its launch. Your favorite trans-generational fashion mash-up is back at it again, this time around, it wants to sell you deluxe sweats.  Following the success of its first and second collections, Fall Risk will launch Volume 3 (Mix ‚Äòem, Match ‚Äòem, Flip ‚Äòem, Stack ‚Äòem) this Saturday, on August 17. In this capsule, cashmere and sweatsuits are the stars of John Targon‚Äôs nostalgia-focused clothing brand.  ‚ÄúI like the idea of viewing it as a go-together game with only one rule: everything matches,‚Äù says Targon (formerly of Baja East). ‚ÄúI‚Äôm thrilled to offer luxurious cashmere for everyday activities.‚Äù In 100% cashmere waffle, the matching joggers and hoodies come in two different color combos. Rock the black and purple set to add some edge to your wardrobe, or sport the turquoise and yellow set to exude your penchant for fun.

To help you get through your middle seat, baby crying, 5-hour delayed flight A post shared by  FALL RISK (@fallriskinc) on Jul 29, 2019 at 3:23pm PDT Of the premium cashmere material, Targon said, ‚ÄúThe yarn was so precious to us that there was no cutting involved with production. A single strand of yarn was used in each panel of the garment, knit into the exact shape and fit, achieving almost zero waste. The result is a textured, buttery fabric that is voluminous and plush. We created a modern, large-scale version of a traditional 3D waffle technique that is both durable and super comfortable. " At a time when more and more are focused on sustainable brands and conscious consumption, Targon is mindful of large production margins that often go to waste, "your purchase supports our love for quality craftsmanship and zero waste.‚Äù  Each of the four items‚Äìwhich will retail at $395 USD‚Äìwill have only 50 units in stock, which means you should set your alarm for the drop now (after all, Volume 1 sold out in just 45 minutes‚ÄîBella Hadid wearing pieces probably didn't hurt either).  The collection can be purchased on the brand‚Äôs website, at the Communitie Marfa and the Communitie East boutiques or at its 212-982-RISK hotline.

 The Stranger Things actress talks '80s style, Cartier bijoux, and what's in store for season three. Natalia Dyer is in a pink and white confection of a room at the Ritz in Paris, getting ready to put on her Prada for a night of dinner, dancing, and jewelry to celebrate the launch of Cartier's new Clash collection. It's primed to be a truly extravagant affair with performances by Billy Idol and Christine and the Queens, and mile-long tables with seating for the likes of Jake Gyllenhaal and Rami Malek. Before she's whisked off with her date to the former prison/palace that held Marie Antoinette before her execution for the evening, co-star and rumored boyfriend Charlie Heaton, the shy 22-year-old posed in a cozy robe and bijoux for BAZAAR.com. See how she stacks her Clash, how she really feels about how fast life can change with a hit Netflix show, traveling with a fear of flying, and taking on the horror genre.   Where do we find Nancy at the start of season three? Nancy has a summer job‚Äîshe‚Äôs hard at work figuring out her next steps. The trailer gives some of it away, I‚Äôm always scared to give away too much. Where do we find Natalia right now? How are you feeling about the trajectory your career has taken? I feel good. I feel really good, I‚Äôm excited, the past couple of years of my life have been big ones, a whirlwind, a lot of opportunity. You can‚Äôt plan too far ahead. It‚Äôs good to have some down time to travel and focus on things you don‚Äôt get to when you‚Äôre working. Where are your top travel destinations? I just did a trip with friends in Barcelona and a tiny town in Italy‚ÄîEurope has been my exploration. I‚Äôve been able to travel more in the last few years and I want to take advantage of that. But Tokyo is my favorite so far. And Paris! What was it like being in the City of Lights with Cartier? It was magical‚Äîit was all very grand, the dinner was amazing, honestly it was such a spectacle. It‚Äôs what you associate Paris with‚Äîlavish, ornate. I did all things I would never have done on my own in Paris. Billie Idol performed as well, do you feel like the '80s are following you? I don't mind, I think the '80s was just a really fun time. I see why it was an attractive time to think about and be inspired by, it has a really good vibe overall. But it is starting to feel very familiar! What‚Äôs changed most for you since the show premiered? The day to day stuff. I fly under the radar, but just that people who you don‚Äôt know know your name, and talk to you. It‚Äôs mostly positive, really nice people but it‚Äôs always going to feel a little strange to me. I‚Äôm aware of it, but it still catches me off guard. Mentally it‚Äôs the biggest adjustment change. It‚Äôs all positive things. What were your goals when you started acting? When I started in the theatre I was pretty young, so I didn‚Äôt have goals per se. When I was younger I would have said I wanted to be on Broadway, Phantom of the Opera or something. It was always just fun, it was always something I really loved to do, I had supportive parents. Is it something you see yourself doing for the rest of your life? Yes. I think initially, I didn‚Äôt know if it was going to be a career, but it‚Äôs a bit addictive if you enjoy it. I can‚Äôt imagine not doing it, I would seek it out in whatever form available. You're always growing and learning and it‚Äôs so dynamic, it‚Äôs helpful too as a human. I don‚Äôt know in what capacity I'll be acting, but I'll always do it. What would be your biggest dream role? Younger me would have said live action Anastasia. You get these scripts and you read them, so it‚Äôs hard to say specifically, but working with great directors is something I‚Äôd like to do. I would like to explore comedy and an action role. I just always want to tell good stories. You‚Äôre also in a Netflix horror movie, have you always liked the scary movie genre? Do they freak you out?  No, no, no. I don‚Äôt like scary movies almost at all, I‚Äôve had to watch them. You have to drag me to scary movies. I just saw Us and that‚Äôs my threshold for scary movies. I‚Äôm getting more acquainted with it. When you‚Äôre acting in scary things, it‚Äôs easier to be like 'it‚Äôs not real,' but it‚Äôs not my genre. What‚Äôs your biggest fear? Flying. I‚Äôm not a great flyer, I think I‚Äôm getting better at it and then turbulence hits and I‚Äôm in tears. I‚Äôm working on it, I‚Äôm a baby, I need to get a handle on it. Trains are great. How do you approach the red carpet? Do you like to look like yourself? Does it feel more like dress up? I think it‚Äôs a bit of a balance, I think it‚Äôs fun to wear things that you would never ever wear outside of that setting but I think it‚Äôs more like exploring different versions of yourself. I put a high value on comfort. It‚Äôs a fun time and I work with Brad Goreski who puts things on me that I would never think to wear but that I actually love, to find new sides of me. It‚Äôs a creative outlet almost. Who are your favorite designers to wear? Brad also throws things at me that I‚Äôve never heard of. I‚Äôm a fan of Prada and Dior, beautiful brands like that, but there are less well known brands that I‚Äôve worn that I‚Äôve really loved. Do you try to avoid 1980s associations in your red carpet looks? I don‚Äôt actively steer clear of it. In some ways, it doesn‚Äôt always suit me. I haven‚Äôt actively avoided it, but maybe subconsciously. But if the right look came along, why not? What‚Äôs your jewelry philosophy? More is more? One special piece? For me, I like to keep a few small sentimental pieces, less for decoration per se. I‚Äôm not a huge jewelry person, I get overwhelmed if I‚Äôm wearing too much, I like things that don‚Äôt really get in my way. Less is more, it‚Äôs important that it's sentimental. The Cartier pieces are small and unobtrusive, but still very cool.
 The famed photographer has denied the allegations made against him. Burberry, Michael Kors, and Stuart Weitzman have vowed not to work with Mario Testino again, following sexual misconduct allegations. On Saturday 13 January, the New York Times published an expose detailing claims made by 13 models and former assistants accusing him of sexual assault. Testino has denied the allegations.  His legal team, Lavely & Singer, challenged the "characters and credibility" of those who have made the claims, adding that they "cannot be considered reliable sources." The lawyers also said that former employees were "shocked by the allegations" and "could not confirm any of the claims." However, WWD reports that multiple fashion brands have since dropped the famed photographer, who is known for shooting luxury fashion campaigns, as well as working with the royal family.  Burberry‚Äîwho hasn't worked with Testino since 2016‚Äîhas no future plans with him. In a statement, the brand said: In addition, Michael Kors vowed to stop working with the photographer: "We recently learned of the allegations concerning Mario Testino. In light of the seriousness of these accusations, we will not be working with Mr. Testino on future advertising campaigns." Stuart Weitzman's chief executive officer and brand president, Wendy Kahn, also said that the brand will not work with Testino for the "foreseeable future." The photographer is responsible for several of the footwear brand's campaigns, which have starred Gigi Hadid, Joan Smalls, and Lily Aldridge. Kahn told WWD:

 The festivities were short lived.  After filming the Victoria‚Äôs Secret Fashion Show in Shanghai earlier today, the VS models headed to the official afterparty to celebrate. However, the festivities were cut short by local authorities, WWD reports.  The models‚Äîincluding Bella Hadid, Alessandra Ambrosio, Jasmine Tookes, and more‚Äîmade their way to the party in a neighboring building after they finished filming the fashion show at around 9 p.m. Ten minutes before midnight, however, the music abruptly stopped and  a number of uniformed police officers started to enter the venue, according to WWD.  ‚ÄúThey want us to finish. We are sorry, we tried,‚Äù said a woman directing the crowd on a microphone. Luckily the models were able to get their photos on the pink carpet and get some dancing in at the party before it ended prematurely. As of right now, the reason for the unexpected shutdown has not yet been confirmed. This is just the latest of issues Victoria‚Äôs Secret has encountered while producing this year‚Äôs fashion show in Shanghai. Days before today‚Äôs filming, it was reported that Katy Perry, who was expected to perform, was denied a Chinese visa. Top model Gigi Hadid, who was previously confirmed to walk in today‚Äôs show, was also reportedly banned from entering the country. Several other models, and some bloggers who were planning to attend and cover the event, were also reportedly denied entry.
 Finding the right watch is a bit like finding a husband. Finding the right watch is a bit like finding a husband.p> Finding the right watch is a bit like finding a husband. Pick a great one and you'll keep it forever; pick the wrong one and you'll be dying to get rid of it after a year or two. Ana Maria Pimentel, accessories director at Neiman Marcus, took it a step further: She started her marriage with a watch. "Instead of an engagement ring, I got engaged with a 1954 Rolex Oyster," she says. The relationship women have with their watches is sacred: Claire Distenfeld, the 27-year-old owner of the concept boutique Fivestory, on Manhattan's Upper East Side, remembers mourning the loss of a Franck Muller Cintr√©e Curvex watch that she'd received as a graduation present. "I had to take a four-year hiatus after losing it," she says. "I thought I couldn't be trusted." Distenfeld is now a Rolex girl; her current relationship is with a men's Oyster. Gender-bending watches are nothing new, but they continue to hit the mark for a casual-chic modern-garconne effect. "A huge face looks masculine and sporty," says Caroline Issa, executive fashion director of Tank magazine. Madonna has been known to run around town in a men's Longines watch. And, as it turns out, choosing a men's watch is the accessory equivalent of "wearing the pants." Adds Pimentel, "We're definitely seeing a trend of women wearing oversize, sportier watches. Colored ceramic versions are especially big for summer." For women who want a classic and timeless look, the ne plus ultra is the Cartier Tank, the square-faced fashion insider's favorite that dates from 1917 and that first ladies from Jacqueline Kennedy to Michelle Obama have worn. Those looking to add a little more edge might go for the stud-enhanced Herm√©s Medor. (Shala Monroque loves her pink one.) It's the perfect watch for the trend-conscious. And if you want the ultimate in opulence, there's the Bulgari Serpenti, an elegant 70-year-old bracelet style that was a favorite of Elizabeth Taylor's and continues to lure fans like sartorial maverick Anna Dello Russo. By wearing hers with chunky gold cuffs on one or both arms, Dello Russo has paved the way for women to wear a traditional evening watch for daytime. On the flip side, the actress Elizabeth Olsen was recently spotted at night wearing an oversize black Chanel J12 with a tuxedo jacket and black leather trousers. The new rule for wearing a watch? If you invest wisely and style it right, any watch can look right at any time. What you wear with your timepiece is just as important as when you wear it. At the moment, Issa is on a small-and-classic kick, wearing vintage watches she layers with big Eddie Borgo cuffs and gold Yves Saint Laurent leopard bracelets. "I switch my watch out depending on my look," she explains. "It's nice to pair a thinner, more ladylike watch with lots of bracelets and do something chunkier with a suit." As for Monroque, she prefers a Marc Newson Ikepod when not wearing her Herm√©s Medor. "It's funny because it has a gray rubber band, but it still manages to go with almost anything," says Monroque. "Sometimes I'll wear it alone, or I'll pile on some PVC bracelets with it." Distenfeld wears hers alone, with bracelets on her other wrist. "It's like a big bangle, so it's not comfy to wear it with a lot of other stuff," she says. "I load the bracelets on the other hand‚Äîevil eyes that I collect as I travel, an Aur√©lie Bidermann lip cuff we made for Fivestory, and a Jennifer Fisher chain-link bangle." Offers Pimentel,"I love the idea of mixing things that are precious with things that aren't, like an 18-karat-gold watch with friendship bracelets or something from Giles & Brother." Other new trends in the watch world? According to Distenfeld, though "most people gravitate toward silver, stainless steel, and white gold," a rose-gold Rolex is the Rolls-Royce of watches. "I've become obsessed," she admits. "A watch like mine in rose gold costs as much as a car, so I can't justify it, but I really think it's the most beautiful." Pimentel seconds the popularity of rose gold, adding that vintage watches and those with rubber bands are also in high demand. Whether you're going for the full rose gold or a more casual rubber-band style, a watch can set the tone for your look and can be transformed from day to day depending on how you style it. But if you're still not ready to fully commit to one model, "there's always the possibility of a second watch," says Pimentel. CLICK THROUGH TO FIND YOUR WATCH STYLE.

 Monday will be the designer's last show as creative director.  After heralding her eponymous fashion house for 37 years, Carolina Herrera is stepping down as its creative director.  On Monday, the designer's Fall 2018 show will mark her final bow at New York Fashion Week, the New York Times reports. Taking over the reins as creative director will be Wes Gordon, who has worked as a creative consultant to the designer for the past year.  "Just don‚Äôt say I am retiring, I am not retiring! I am moving forward," she said in an interview with the Times.  Moving forward, Herrera will hold the title of "Global Brand Ambassador" at her namesake brand, while Gordon takes over as creative director. In her new role, she will continue to work closely with the house, attending store openings and events, but will not be designing the actual collections. "I am thrilled with the evolution of the company over the past 37 years‚Ä¶There is still so much opportunity and I look forward to continuing to represent this house and our projects all around the world. I am so pleased Wes is now part of the Herrera house‚Äîhe‚Äôs the right one for this position to further build on our great momentum," Herrera said in a statement from the brand.  The designer, who has a force in the fashion industry for nearly four decades, has become synonymous with elegance, sophistication and ultra-feminine designs. While speaking with the Times, however, she revealed how the fashion industry is veering away from that: "Fashion has changed a lot. What they like now is ugliness. Women dress in a very strange way. Like clowns. There is a lot of pressure to change all the time. But it‚Äôs better to wear what suits you. Add something new and you have a great look. Consistency is important.‚Äù
 The fashion retailer says customers are free to use any fitting rooms. Topshop has announced that its changing rooms are gender-neutral, following a complaint from a trans customer who claimed they were refused access to female fitting rooms. Performance artist Travis Alabanza, who identifies as trans female and uses the pronoun "they," claims they were told to use the male changing rooms when they attempted to use the female changing cubicles to try on dresses. Alabanza‚Äîwho was shopping in a Topshop in Manchester, England‚Äîwas allegedly told by staff to use the male changing rooms downstairs instead. "Hey @Topshop just experienced transphobia in your Manchester store. Not letting me use the changing room I decide is shit, sort it out," Alabanza tweeted.  Topshop later contacted another customer and reiterated their policy that all changing rooms were available for everyone. A spokesperson from the brand told Cosmopolitan UK in a statement: "All TOPSHOP TOPMAN customers are free to use any of the fitting rooms located within our stores." The announcement applies "to all Topshop‚Äôs wholly owned stores worldwide," a rep told BAZAAR.com. It's not entirely clear whether this policy has been rolled out in response to Alabanza's and other complaints, or whether it was already in existence. Alabanza recalled the incident in more detail to Buzzfeed recalling: "She [staff member] wasn't rude, but she wasn't sympathetic either.  "I said, 'I'm not going to be safe down there. What do you want me to do?' and they just kind of shrugged. "I did think I could buy the dresses and take them home to try on, but I felt like, why am I doing this? My day instantly became politicized when all I wanted was a chill day shopping. "It's just been a whole stretched-out thing when all I wanted was to go into Topshop and go out. I normally online shop for this reason." Alabanza has since suggested that the fashion retailer should go beyond its gender-neutral fitting room policy and "train the staff about what it means to serve every kind of customer, how to advocate for us and respond against people who are phobic."

 In honor of Valentine's Day, we asked top models on the set of their BAZAAR x CR fashion shoot to open up about all things romance.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. While on-set for Carine Roitfeld's 'Stardust' portfolio, Hailey Bieber, Taylor Hill, Winnie Harlow, and more top models talk about their first (and worst) kiss, sweet relationship moments, and all things romance. Newlywed Hailey Bieber, who married Justin Bieber in a secret courthouse marriage last September, shares her new surname with camera: "I'm Hailey Bieber‚Äîand not Baldwin anymore!" Bieber excitedly introduces herself. "Everyone knows now."  Hailey recalls her first kiss, which took place in middle school. ‚ÄúThe first kiss that I can remember with a boy that I really, really, really had a big crush on when I was probably 12 or 13,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWe were sledding at my house, we did a little jump onto the driveway, and we were laying there and laughing, and there was snow on the ground, and we kissed.‚Äù The nicest (and most unexpected) thing a guy has ever done for Hailey came from her now-husband Justin. ‚ÄúI got home from work one day, and my husband had flowers just because on the table for me. No one had ever done that for me before for just no occasion, no specific occasion," she says with a smile.  Victoria's Secret Angel Taylor Hill explains that although she doesn't recall precisely who her first kiss was with, she does remember it happened when she was only five years old on the playground. ‚ÄúI thought it was what you would do if you were friends, because I thought my parents were friends and they would kiss,‚Äù she reminisces of the sweet moment.   Winnie Harlow, who got her start on Tyra Banks' America's Next Top Model and walked her first Victoria's Secret Fashion Show this past year, reveals that she also had her first kiss on the playground sometime around 1st grade. "We were playing girls versus boys freeze tag and I ran after my crush, pinned him on the floor, and kissed him," she says with a laugh.  One of the sweetest things a guy has ever done for Harlow was "coming and supporting me on one of the biggest days of my career-life. And jewelry," she adds with a laugh. Although she did not mention the mystery man by name, her current boyfriend, Wiz Khalifa did attend the 2018 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show.

 From the new Schiaparelli to Chanel, all the most swoon-worthy runway haute couture.   Despite an ongoing European heatwave, Fall 2019 Haute Couture is hitting the runways in Paris this week. From over-the-top, swoon-worthy gowns to the most beautiful (and unexpected) hand-sewn details, we're tracking all the most breathtaking runway looks throughout the week. Click through to see all the best Fall 2019 Couture Week looks in real time.  Feathers, capes, and volume: Clare Waight Keller brought the drama to Givenchy‚Äôs latest couture collection. Fantasy and glamour came to life in the form of whimsical, towering feather gowns done in shades of mint green and black. A stunning lavender cape coat and tailored coat dresses complete with feather details brought elegance to new heights. And in a sea of ultra-glam ball gowns and feathers, sparkling metallic sequins and tailored coat dresses added unexpected touches of cool. Waight Keller has only been designing couture for two years now‚Äîbut with this collection, it seems she‚Äôs already becoming a master of the art. ‚ÄîLauren Alexis Fisher Virginie Viard showed her first couture presentation today, and it was nothing short of a hit. All roads lead back to Coco‚Äîthe sweeping library that housed the Chanel Couture show at the Grand Palais was inspired by a neutral-hued one at the house's founder's home on Rue Cambon. The collection paid homage to those Chanel roots favored by Coco and Karl Lagerfeld: tweedy, long slim jackets, skirt suits, little black bowed shoes, pearl accents. But it was also very much the designer's own. Oversized, round shouldered jackets over mini dresses, ultra feminine dresses with bows and sheer chiffon, face framing ruffs, some elegant sparkle. Viand is keeping Chanel Chanel, bien sur, but with a new approach to quiet sophistication that feels all hers. -Kerry Pieri From candy-colored pastels to smart suiting and grand red carpet-worthy gowns, the Armani Priv√© couture woman is ready for every occasion this season. There were series of ‚Äò80s-inspired polka dots, there were sheer nipple-freeing looks, there were even technicolor gowns made of tulle and (faux) fur. Details like oversized bows and tiny leather rose hair pieces amped up the femininity of the collection‚Äîjust in case all the pastel tulle and silk didn‚Äôt do so enough. But whether she‚Äôs going to the boardroom or a ball, Mr. Armani delivered plenty of dreamy looks to choose from. ‚ÄîLauren Alexis Fisher
 The '90s-inspired collection will make you nostalgic. Last night, the Prada Resort 2019 collection hit the runway, attracting celebrities, designers, and models to New York City where the show took place in a space designed by Herzog & de Meuron. While Chanel brought an actual cruise ship to the runway for its Cruise 2019 show in Paris, Prada kept things lowkey, but no less dramatic.  The show took place in the minimalistic space designed by Herzog & de Meuron, and was followed by a private dinner hosted by Miuccia Prada at Piano Factory, the brand's headquarters in New York: With heavy nods to the '90s, WWD described the collection as "geeky-cool" and "inclusive of specific references to the spring 1996 collection in which she famously thrust 'ugly' prints into the forefront for fashion." Fashionista agreed that "Many of the pieces felt like revamps of prior Prada classics," noting that the current trend for recycling retro looks appeared to have inspired Prada's Resort 2019. Here, a "fresh take on a classic": The collection also featured a plethora of hats: And the show was attended by numerous celebrities, including Selena Gomez, Dakota Fanning, Marc Jacobs, Uma Thurman, Claire Danes, Lily Collins, Baz Luhrmann, Alexa Chung, Ava DuVernay, Katherine Langford, Sasha Lane, and Chlo√´ Sevigny, the majority of whom wore Prada: The show was also live-streamed in Times Square, and the runway itself "mirrored New York‚Äôs frenetic energy," according to Prada. This cyclical effect continued as images of the models walking in the show "were played and distorted on hanging, transparent screens throughout the set":  
 It's all so very English...  Vivienne Westwood and Burberry, along with Westwood's husband Andreas Kronthaler,  have revealed the campaign for their highly anticipated collaboration ‚Äî the first for the brand under newly appointed Chief Creative Officer Riccardo Tisci.   "Vivienne Westwood was one of the first designers who made me dream to become a designer myself and when I first started at Burberry, I knew it would be the perfect opportunity to approach her to do something," says Tisci. "She is a rebel, a punk and unrivalled in her unique representation of British style, which has inspired so many of us. I am so incredibly proud of what we will be creating together." The collection features double-breasted jackets, trousers, silk shirts, kilts, a beret, tights and pins ‚Äî all in Westwood‚Äôs iconic designs, reimagined in Burberry‚Äôs vintage check pattern.  The stunning campaign images were shot by David Sims and feature a cast of characters including the iconic Kate Moss, Vivienne Westwood herself, Andreas Kronthaler, Sistren, and Leonard Emmanuel, all wearing looks from the limited-edition collection.       The oh-so-English collection also has a charitable aspect to it. Westwood and Tisci shared the vision to support UK non-profit organization Cool Earth, which supports efforts in rainforest communities to halt deforestation and climate change. An oversized T-shirt that reads "'Cool Earth has a plan to save the rainforest" in Westwood's handwriting is dedicated to the charity. Westwood has also shared plans to customize four exclusive items from the collection to be auctioned and raise more for Cool Earth. The collection begins at $70 and is available in select stores worldwide, as well as online at burberry.com.

 ‚ÄúWe are all devastated by today‚Äôs tragedy." Kate Spade's family has responded to the designer's death from an apparent suicide. ‚ÄúWe are all devastated by today‚Äôs tragedy,‚Äù her family said in a statement to The Daily News yesterday. ‚ÄúWe loved Kate dearly and will miss her terribly. We would ask that our privacy be respected as we grieve during this very difficult time.‚Äù The designer, who was 55 years old, is survived by her husband Andy Spade, who co-founded her eponymous handbag brand, and their 13-year-old daughter, Frances Beatrix Spade.  Actor David Spade, Kate's brother-in-law, responded to the tragic news on social media. On Instagram, he posted a photo and message dedicated to the late designer. "Fuzzy picture but I love it," he wrote. "Kate and I during Christmas family photos. We had so much fun that day. She was so sharp and quick on her feet. She could make me laugh so hard. I still can't believe it. It's a rough world out there people, try to hang on."  Fuzzy picture but i love it. Kate and I during Christmas family photos.  We had so much fun that day.

I just can‚Äôt.‚Äù Spade's niece, actress Rachel Brosnahan (House of Cards, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel), remembered one of her aunt's happier moments. She posted a video of Kate dancing and smiling with her husband on Instagram this morning. "Knowing Katy, this is how she would want to be remembered," Brosnahan captioned the clip. "She had a light that words can‚Äôt capture but touched everyone she came into contact with. She was exceedingly kind, beautifully sensitive, insanely talented, funny as heck and one of the most generous people I have ever known. She was effervescent. Hug your loved ones extra tight today."

 A look back at the year's most FASHUN fashion.   Loving fashion also means acknowledging just how ridiculous fashion can be. From a $1,000 leather Alexander Wang cooler to waitlisted thong jeans and Croc-inspired Balenciaga heels, 2018 delivered plenty of eyebrow-raising items to the fashion world. As the year comes to an end, we're taking a look back at all the wildest, weirdest, and just a tad ridiculous pieces that 2018 graced us with. Hold onto your Gucci heads... Y/Project is known for its risk-taking, deconstructed pieces, so when the Parisian brand designed its own iteration of the classic Ugg boot back in January, the outcome was these thigh-high boots that looked like baggy suede pants.  Before the Year of Our Lord 2018, models typically carried handbags down the runway. But at Gucci's Fall 2018 show, Alessandro Michele introduced a new crop of accessories for models to tote: human heads and baby dragons. The creepy, sci fi-esque pieces served as the real stars of the show, sparking endless memes, of course. In case you forgot how much of a wild ride 2018 has been, let me remind you of thong jeans. Back in the spring, LA-based brand Carmar Denim unveiled a pair of ultra-distressed jeans that somehow instantly sold out. It's unclear how many of the jeans were produced, but an online waitlist to buy the $168 jeans‚Äîwhich are actually just the seams of jeans‚Äîquickly accrued.  Taking the ugly shoe trend to new heights, Christopher Kane put his own fashun twist on orthopedic shoes for brand's Fall 2018 collection. And the sneaker-like shoes didn't just look like orthopedic shoes‚Äîthey were actually a collaboration with orthopedic footwear brand Z-Coil.  In a surprise collaboration with Magnum Ice Cream, Alexander Wang unveiled a luxe black leather cooler (to store all your Magnum bars in style, obviously). The cooler, toted by Bella Hadid and Wang himself in the campaign, was available to shop for a cool $1,000.   Who needs Instagram filters when you‚Äôve got mods?

Human (@ahuman) on Aug 31, 2018 at 12:31pm PDT Delivering one of the most mind-blowing fashion moments of 2018, a body modification accessory exhibition titled "A. Human" opened to coincide with New York Fashion Week in September. Kim Kardashian West and Chrissy Teigen were amongst the first to debut the body modification pieces, which included a built-in choker necklace that moves in sync with your heartbeat and biological high heel implants. The trippy accessories, which were not actually available to buy, instead remained on display in an interactive exhibit that explored the potential future of fashion.  Balenciaga gave us platform Crocs in 2017, in 2018, the fashion house followed up with Barbie-inspired Croc heels. The pumps even included Balenciaga's high fashion take on Croc's kitschy, kid-friendly pins. And strangely enough, I really kind of wanted a pair?  For those looking to hide from the hellish news cycle that was 2018, Thom Browne came up with an interesting solution for his Spring 2019 show. The designer sent a lineup of playful face masks in the form of beach balls, melted ice cream cones, snorkels, rugby masks, and more down the runway. It certainly made for a new form of escapism.  Last but not least, this bag definitely falls into the category of Crazy Genius. For his Spring 2019 collection, Brandon Maxwell sent clear box bags filled with ros√© bottles down the runway. A handbag meant specifically for carrying bottles of champagne and ros√© is exactly what we need to carry out of 2018.
 Her brand became a household name overnight. A little-known Australian designer received the royal seal of approval on Tuesday when Meghan Markle wore one of her dresses in Sydney.  Designer Karen Gee's website crashed after the Duchess of Sussex wowed onlookers in a simple ivory shift as she greeted government officials with Prince Harry on day one of their Australian tour. Despite the pregnancy announcement Monday by Kensington Palace, the dress showed a barely visible baby bump. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an absolute honor to have Meghan wear our dress,‚Äù Gee told BAZAAR.com.  ‚ÄúThe fact that she could choose anyone in the world and she‚Äôs chosen Karen Gee on her first day is phenomenal.‚Äù The bespoke ‚ÄòBlessed‚Äô shift dress, which retails for $1,285, takes around one day to make and is available in ivory, ink, and black.  The royal plug sparked an online shopping frenzy and caused Gee‚Äôs website to crash several times throughout the day. The brand, which offers made-to-order pieces along with ready-to-wear in its flagship store at Sydney's Chifley Plaza, was also flooded with calls from shoppers all wanting to emulate Markle‚Äôs debut maternity look. ‚ÄúThe purpose of the brand is to encourage women to feel good no matter what size and shape they are,‚Äù said Gee, a mother-of-five. ‚ÄúI truly believe Meghan is empowering because she is confident, backs herself‚Äîand who doesn‚Äôt love her?‚Äù While the designer remains tight-lipped on the royal commission (even on the fabric) she did reveal the style comes with satin binding and couture zippers. It is also the brand's policy to never ‚Äògift‚Äô products in return for a celebrity plug. Gee launched the ethically made label (it is accredited by Ethical Clothing Australia, which ensures supply chains are transparent and legally compliant) five years ago, and her body-hugging designs are often purchased and worn by local TV celebrities.  Gee's philanthropic work may have also appealed to the Duchess.  Prior to launching the brand in 2013, Gee won the Mrs Australia Globe competition‚Äîa national pageant for women over 25 that helps raise money for charities.  On day one of Meghan and Prince Harry‚Äôs Australian tour they will also visit Taronga Zoo and the Sydney Opera House to watch a rehearsal of Spirit 2018 by the Bangarra Dance Theatre.  The couple are in Sydney to launch the Invictus Games this Saturday. Their 16-day tour will also include visits to Fiji, Tonga, and New Zealand.
 These shoes had a 25,000 person wait list. Meghan Markle loves her heels, rocking stilettos well into her pregnancy. But every once in a while, the Duchess wants to wear a comfy pair of flats. That's when she has been known to turn to the Natalie by designer Sarah Flint, a pointy-toe style with a subtle bow detail. She's worn the Natalie multiple times, perhaps most notably when she made her public debut alongside then-boyfriend Prince Harry at the 2017 Invictus Games.  Back then, she paired the shoes with distressed jeans from Mother Denim, a crisp white button-down by her friend designer Misha Nonoo, a matching cognac-colored tote bag from Everlane, and tortoise-shell shades.  Like much of what Markle wears, the shoes have become widely popular, and at one-point even boasted a 25,000 person waiting list. But today, all the colorways, including the "saddle" shade the Duchess of Sussex sported back in 2017, as well as black, red, leopard print, and gold, are back in stock. And for a limited time, they're also on sale.  Take $50 off any Natalie flat with the code HBDNATALIE. "I designed it to be versatile and comfortable, but still elevated with a pointed toe and subtle bow. I‚Äôm glad that our customers love the Natalie as much as I do!" Flint said in an email to T&C.

 Her past bags still have miles long waiting lists, don't fall in that trap again... Gabriela Hearst's "Nina" bag did what all designers hope for when designing accessories: garnering a dedicated fan base who wanted it in multiple colors, it drew waitlists that continue to grow to this day. Not one to rest on her laurels, Hearst is back with a brand new bag, the Patsy. A lunch-box inspired shape, it shares the super luxe vibe of the Nina in a more structured silhouette.  The New York-based Hearst is consistently thoughtful in her designs, researching ethical and sustainable fabrications and practices, and her inspiration for the Patsy is no different. Inspired by working women in the 1940s, the Patsy is more than a pretty bag, it has a feminist heart. "The research process for every collection is one of my favorite parts," the designer explains, "My motto is to understand our history to know where we came from and where we are going." What she discovered is basically a fist pump from our collective Grandmas. "I was inspired by the lunch boxes of women entering the work force during the 1940s," she says. "In WWII, from 1940 to 1945, the female work force in the U.S. increased from 27 percent to nearly 37 percent. In 1945, nearly one out of every four married women worked outside the home. Women carrying their lunch boxes during this time became a patriotic and important symbol for women and stressed the the need for them in the work force at a crucial time, and they did exactly that in huge numbers. It‚Äôs a reminder of what our gender has accomplished but also how much more is left to do in order to achieve equality for all." "Women carrying their lunch boxes during this time became a patriotic and important symbol." Hearst is launching the Patsy exclusively with Net-a-Porter on Monday, October 1, and that story isn't as simple as it seems either. "For our bags, it takes an average of nine to 10 months from original conception to sample," Hearst tells BAZAAR.com. "We work on them for a long time and the production can take a minimum of three months, hence our waitlists."  It was important for Hearst to launch the brand's authentication cards with embedded blockchain technology "that is synonymous with luxury  and that has a global reach," she notes. "The bags will only be available for two weeks, so that we can open the window for more customers to experience an authentic Gabriela Hearst handbag." The Gabriela Hearst "Patsy" bag is available on Monday, Oct 1 for two weeks on net-a-porter.com. SHOP NOW
 Clare Waight Keller went all in at Givenchy... Bows and hair bows in particular have officially become a thing. One can hardly get through an Instagram session without stumbling upon a moodily filtered image of a velvet or silk bow worn insouciantly in a perfectly executed ponytail. Like Brigitte Bardot, the bow is inherently French in a way that feels almost impossible to separate. C'est chic, without ever trying too hard. But British royal Kate Middleton, better known for her equestrian jackets, skirt suits, and candy colored evening gowns, has become an unofficial spokeswoman for the velvet hair bow thanks to an inexpensive (and obviously no longer available) J. Crew one she's been wearing around London-town. Like everything Kate wears, the masses are sold on its appeal.  Proving the bow‚Äôs mass appeal, but skipping the tiny velvet iteration altogether, designer Clare Waight Keller introduced Super-sized bows for her couture collection for Givenchy today‚Äîher third for the brand. Waight Keller isn't an overtly feminine designer, her designs for Givenchy have ranged from blazers tucked into cargo pants to sequin column gowns and Megan Markle's sophisticated, lovely, minimal royal wedding dress. But those giant bows, unabashedly girlish, become wing-like on the models walking down the catwalk in flowing gowns. They're attached to backpacks‚Äîdone up in graphic black and white‚Äîso a girl can make an entrance in her bow, but coat-check it if her mood shifts.  They looks are pretty in a way that Audrey Hepburn in Givenchy was pretty‚Äîimpactful but elegant, simple and statement-making. And what good is a six figure couture look if it can't‚Äîliterally‚Äîgive you wings, anyway? 
 The powerhouse designer partnered with Saks on a new capsule... Virgil Abloh spent the night at Saks Fifth Avenue's new in-store hot spot, L'Avenue, to toast his new capsule with the mega department store. He was joined by friends including Gigi Hadid‚Äîwho held her 24th birthday party there a few nights prior‚ÄîLuka Sabbat, Olivia Culpo, Heron Preston, and Jimmy Fallon. People show up for a Virgil Abloh, Off-White event. The man has proven he has that indescribable, allusive magic‚Äîthe ability to make people want to buy things. And he's happy to share the magic, signing onto collaborations that both surprise and delight. His Saks capsule is no different. It just makes good sense‚Äîfilled with Off-White heroes including a denim jacket, a little black dress, cool kicks, a white tee‚Äîall inspired by "fine art." Below, Abloh allows BAZAAR.com into his process, just a bit.  The instance of my brand, Off-White, to have a personal dialogue with Saks. My goal and inspiration was to tell an angle of the brand that would be more direct and momentous with their customer. A means of communication to tell a story. Fashion is art to me‚ÄìI‚Äôm involved with all facets of art.  My work in architecture, music, fashion, and my art exhibitions all work hand in hand and serve as inspiration to one another. I see fashion and art as one great entity. I enjoy doing collaborations because I‚Äôm an optimist. Collaborations provide the opportunity to explore ideas and create things that haven‚Äôt been done before‚Äìor even perhaps give way to change the scope of fashion altogether.  I‚Äôm inspired by the natural pace of life‚Äìthere are no dull moments or off time. I‚Äôm invigorated by existing‚ÄìI don‚Äôt get any gratification by not existing, so the balance is instinctive. 
 A look back at the decade that continues to influence today's style.  From the debut of the mini skirt to mod-inspired styles, the 1960s were known for breaking fashion norms and traditions. With the influence of British fashion, the rise of daring hemlines and the breakout of Twiggy, there was plenty of newness to be inspired by in the '60s. Click through to relive the best styles from one of the most impactful eras of fashion.  The elegance of the 1950s carried into the early part of the new decade. Here, a model wears a red, fur-collared coat with brown leather gloves and matching pumps.  Diahann Carroll poses in a red belted dress layered over a creme jumpsuit at the Watts Towers in Los Angeles. The New Look cocktail dresses of the 1950s carried over into the early '60s, especially for dinner parties and evening attire.  A model in a checkered skirt suit.

 The designer goes from Posh to Sporty with a new range of activewear and trainers.  There was once a time when Victoria Beckham notoriously only wore sky-high heels. These days, however, the designer is embracing a wardrobe with a bit more ease‚Äîand even... sneakers. So much so that she teamed up with Reebok for an activewear collection that's equal parts chic and workout-friendly (or more accurately, Posh meets Sporty).  Marking her first foray into athletic-wear, the first drop of Victoria Beckham x Reebok features sleek sports bras, tracksuits, and a turtleneck-esque sweatshirt that (sadly) sold out in less than 12 hours. For Beckham, it was important to design a wearable collection that worked for everyday women and men all over the world. "I don't want a 'woman's' trainer, I don't want a 'woman's' hoodie...I want a trainer, I want a hoodie," Beckham explained at a press preview for the collection's launch, calling most of the pieces unisex.   Launch day! Morning workout in my new #ReebokxVictoriaBeckham crop top, leggings, Bolton low trainers (available in March!) and cap!! x VB A post shared by  Victoria Beckham (@victoriabeckham) on Jan 22, 2019 at 4:03am PST   With her own namesake brand, Beckham says she focuses on designing clothes that empower women. Her Reebok pieces are no exception, staying true to her own personal style and the core aesthetics of her ready-to-wear line. In fact, when asked if anyone or anything in particular inspired the collection, she shrugged: "Just me, really." With VB-esque shades of camel, minimal silhouettes, and some of the chicest sweatshirts we've ever seen, it shows. After a morning of showing off the new collection to a group of editors, Beckham sat down with BAZAAR.com to talk about her collaboration with Reebok‚Äîand her biggest style inspiration: herself. Harper's BAZAAR: The high-neck sweatshirt is my favorite piece from the collection, I‚Äôm so bummed it already sold out!Victoria Beckham: I know, it‚Äôs a great top.  HB: So you‚Äôve gone from wearing nothing but high heels to designing a collection with Reebok. How did you start embracing sneakers and activewear in your wardrobe? VB: I mean, I‚Äôve been wearing trainers for quite a long time and I love mixing them with ready-to-wear. I think that‚Äôs the great thing about sportswear, is that you can really mix it and make it your own. HB: Is there anything or anyone in particular that inspired the collection?  VB: Just me, really, and everything that I need in my life.  HB: How do you mix and match activewear with pieces from your own brand on a regular basis? VB: I think a lot of this really does work when you wear it with men‚Äôs tailoring, like a really cool men‚Äôs tailored coat that you might throw over your shoulders or the bomber with some high-waisted vintage jeans.  HB: Is there anything happening in fashion right now that you‚Äôre excited about? Especially now that more luxury brands are delving into activewear collaborations like this.  VB: Um, not really. I don‚Äôt really know what to say, I feel that this is exciting and feels different and new and fresh.  HB: I know your kids and David are really into sportswear, did they have any input with this collection or the design process? VB: No. I mean, they like it and they want to wear it so I think that‚Äôs a good sign.   HB: You‚Äôre doing more collections with Reebok in the future. Is there anything that you didn‚Äôt get to do in this first collection that you‚Äôre looking forward to doing in the next? VB: Yeah, there are some things that time-wise we couldn‚Äôt get into the first collection. And also, I wanted this to be a very focused collection, so there‚Äôs lots of great pieces that we started working on that will be in the next collection.  
 From kitten heels to platforms, high heels have been a staple accessory for centuries.  Heels are an instant pick-me-up for any outfit, adding a figure-flattering boost and a dose of confidence to the wearer. However, the beauty of high heels are that they come in many different shapes and styles. Think kitten heels, platform heels, strappy heeled sandals, wedges, and even heels made out of lucite or geometric shapes. From the 1500s to today, between Audrey Hepburn's signature black kitten heel, to Lady Gaga's massive armadillo shoes, high heels have been an integral component of wardrobes for centuries. Click through to see how the shoe has evolved over the years.  The earliest instances of heeled shoes date back as far as the Egyptians, but the look really picked up steam during the 16th Century. Towering platforms called 'chopines' are thought to have originated with prostitutes in Venice for the added sex appeal the extra height offered, but soon became popular amongst aristocrats for their ability to keep clothes from dragging in the filth that covered the streets.  Though heels today are wore almost exclusively by women, the style was popular among men throughout the 1600s and 1700s. French royalty in particular, like Louis XIV (left) and Marquise de Pompadour (right), were fans of the heeled shoe as it conveyed that the wearer had no use for practical footwear, or the need to walk easily.  By Victorian times and into the early 20th century, heeled boots were the primary choice among elegant ladies. They often featured exposed buttoned closures‚Äînot that they were often seen beneath the long full skirts of the era.  With the raised hemlines of the Roaring Twenties, shoes were now on display. Look at this stylish lady showing off her trendy buckle shoes.  Decorative garters help when shoe styles are simple.  As hemlines stayed above ground, thoughtful details like cut-outs were used to make sturdy leather pumps more interesting. This lady takes things to fancier territory with her shiny satin heels.  ...while this lady is all about the brocade.  Ever wonder where Taylor Swift's love of T-straps originated from? These practical pumps are Exhibit A. Attempts were made to improve the T-strap style by making it in delicate satins for evening rather than clunky leathers. Now we're getting a little better. These cap-toe T-straps have an extra glam touch.  More vintage shoes that Taylor Swift would probably wear today.  Finally, a rare moment of height! Perhaps women were feeling bold in 1929‚Äîuntil the market crash, that is.  1930 was a fairly frumpy year for footwear.  Thank goodness for the golden era of Hollywood and its stunning starlets‚Äìlike Jean Harlow‚Äì who inspired a more glamorous wave of heels.  Casual.  Bette Davis knew the power of a basic black pump.  Now this is our kind of woman. Check out that collection! More low heels and cut-outs and sitting on random tables.  Summertime shoes in 1936 were way chicer than the flip-flops worn poolside today.  Pumps galore.  Ferragamo created his iconic rainbow platform in 1938 for actress Judy Garland.  While the platform may have shot to popularity during the '70s, the late 1930s was when they first came onto the shoe scene.  Replacing the pumps of the 1930s, wedges became a mainstay of women's shoe collections in the '40s.  And thanks to the rise in sky-high wedges, pumps gained a little bit of height and a chunkier sole and heel.  Shoe styles started lightening up in the 40s, when cut-outs turned into the first renditions of the strappy sandal.  Bow details and a revealing vamp give black pumps a distinctly feminine flair.  These ruffled satin slides take boudoir lounging to the next level.  One of the most unique shoe styles we've seen thus far‚ÄìGinger Rogers' wedges have no mid-sole!  Ruffle-front d'Orsay pumps pave the way for some of the 1950s styles.

 Sport Bella Hadid and Kendall Jenner on your new smoking paraphernalia. Alexander Wang revealed his Fall 2017 campaign yesterday, starring classic Wang Squad members like Bella Hadid, Kendall Jenner, Anna Ewers, Binx Walton, Lexi Boling, and Hanne Gaby. The models wear black with matching studded boots, bedhead hair and smoky eyeliner for the "No After Party"-themed ads. The images echo the designer's Fall 2017 presentation in February at RKO Hamilton Theater in Harlem, NYC. Juergen Teller shot the models right after walking the runway, as they hosted their own after-party in the basement of the theater and strutted the icy streets of New York. But the campaign goes beyond glossy images; Wang also hopped on the merch trend and released smoking and drinking accessories emblazoned with the ads. There are rolling papers, ultra-thin shot glasses, a bottle opener, a lighter, and an ash tray in the mix. The items will be released every Friday, starting today, September 15, until October 20, while supplies last. They'll be available with purchase at the brand's flagships in SoHo and London, all Alexander Wang stores in China, and online at alexanderwang.com.

 9-to-5 meets hot girl summer.   While all of us are trying to live our best hot girl summers, Emily Ratajkowski is busy reinventing the look (and mentality) for the boardroom. Giving us the 2019 Working Girl reboot we all deserve, the model stepped out in a blazer, bra, and bike shorts combo‚Äîinstantly becoming the official CEO of hot girl summer.    Wearing an oversized camel power blazer by The Row, a white bra, black bike shorts by Khaite, and croc mules by Giuseppe Zanotti, EmRata took to the streets of New York after attending The Wrap's Power Women Breakfast event in Tribeca. Her outfit combined fashion's ongoing obsession with '80s power suiting (and shoulder pads) with this summer's bike shorts trend.  Unsurprisingly, the look worked just as well on the red carpet as it did in the streets of New York. According to her Instagram, the model/activist was there to discuss starting her own brand, the importance of knowing one‚Äôs self worth, sex positivity, and feminism.   Cue Dolly Parton's "9-to-5," cast EmRata in the upcoming movie remake, and call it a day.   Previously, the model credited Princess Diana with inspiring her style for Summer 2019. "I‚Äôm trying to go ‚Äò80s and have been thinking about Princess Diana‚Äôs street and ready-to-wear moments like a blazer and a bike short and a big sneaker,‚Äù she told Us Weekly in an interview.   Given the late royal's signature '80s and '90s style of oversized blazers and spandex workout attire, it's safe to say EmRata's doing a good job of channeling her muse. 
 At about $440,000 a piece. Whether you're ready for it or not, holiday shopping season is upon us. And if you're already stumped on what to get the special someone in your life, Neiman Marcus has a suggestion: why not a Rolls-Royce convertible or two? The high-end retailer is offering limited-edition Dawn Drophead Coup√©s by the luxury auto dealer as a part of its annual Christmas Book holiday gift catalogue. The vehicles come in two "yours & mine" styles‚Äîbecause why would you give someone a Rolls-Royce without getting one for yourself? There's a Lake Como-inspired blue iteration with a grey-and-black leather interior and a brushed metal dashboard for $439,625:  And there's a Saint-Tropez-inspired orange version with a white-and-brown leather interior, a wood-paneled dashboard and doors, and lambswool floor mats for $445,750: There's also a philanthropic side to the luxurious purchase: with each Dawn Drophead Coup√© purchase, $1,000 will be donated to the The Heart of Neiman Marcus Foundation, which supports youth arts education.  The cars will be available starting November 2. Call 1-800-970-0986 to purchase and get more info here. There will only be 20 vehicles available so maybe don't go buying a bunch at once for your entire extended family. The cars are part of the Fantasy Gifts in Neiman's gift offering, which is full of over-the-top presents. Other options include a trip to Champagne for $150,000, a flight and photo experience with fine art photographer Gray Malin for $35,000, and a tour of Gemfields' emerald mine in Zambia and custom 7.2-carat emerald piece for $300,000.  The Rolls-Royces aren't even the most expensive items in the book; a $1.6 million New Year's Eve experience on the rooftop of The Knickerbocker Hotel in Times Square takes the cake as the priciest indulgence.  Much like the coupes, the offerings come with a charitable perk: a portion of every Fantasy Gift will be donated to The Heart of Neiman Marcus Foundation.  Realistically speaking, those of us with tighter budgets for holiday shopping can still consult Neiman Marcus' gift selection. Nearly half the products cost less than $250, and the cheapest option is a $9 pocket coloring book. SHOP
 Introducing, your It sneaker for fall. Vans and Karl Lagerfeld's upcoming collaboration might make you want to ditch your white summer sneakers for some sleek black kicks. The 12-piece capsule was inspired by Lagerfeld's "evolving design aesthetic with iconic elements from his timeless career," Vans Classics' senior footwear designer Angie Dita told BAZAAR.com. Thus, the resulting collection remixes some of the skate brand's quintessential sneakers‚Äîlike the Old Skool, Sk-8 Hi and Classic Slip-On‚Äîwith motifs like K-quilted leather, boucle fabric, referencing Chanel's signature tweed, and Lagerfeld's profile worked into Vans' famous checkerboard print. The range also extends beyond footwear, with graphic tees, a bomber jacket, premium leather backpack and a cap. News of the collaboration broke just last week, but Lagerfeld and Vans actually started discussing a joint women's collection a few seasons ago. "We decided to work together since both Vans and Karl Lagerfeld‚Äôs brand messaging revolved around creating products that are timeless and iconic," Dita said. The timing of the collection couldn't be more spot-on, just as Vans' Old Skool and Sk8 Hi styles are rising as the new go-to sneaker, and the fashion world continues to tap on the skate aesthetic. (Just take note of Thrasher hoodies in street style shots, or Louis Vuitton's collab with Supreme.) "When I see the fashion world take references from skate trends or brands, I feel that they are intrigued by the fact that skaters are creatives that set their own rules and code," Dita explained. "There is something intriguing about how skateboarding symbolizes a sense of independence and non-conforming attitude that begins at their youth. They follow their own path." Vans x Karl Lagerfeld officially launches on September 7 at select Karl Lagerfeld boutiques, Vans stores and online at vans.com and karl.com. Prices rage from $40-$300. Take your first look at some of the pieces below. 
 A #nofilter look at industry racism. Like many models, Londone Myers likes to post photos and videos of the totally fabulous fashion world. But one of her latest posts is going viral for exposing the struggles that non-white models, particularly black models with natural hair, still face in the industry. In a behind-the-scenes time-lapse video from an unnamed Paris Fashion Week show, Myers waits for someone to work on her hair; when she pans the camera, you can see a group of white models being worked on. As Myers expresses her frustration over no one seeming to want to style her hair in the caption: Myers explained to Teen Vogue that she usually didn't even try to get a professional to do her hair before shows, but this one time, she showed up "unprepared" ‚Äî how everyone else shows up.  As Myers expresses, it isn't as though any one individual or beauty team or even designer is to blame for the treatment she received. Rather, the industry at large still finds itself either unable or unwilling to accommodate different (and often racialized) hair textures. This all feeds back to the push to cast a more diverse range of faces, bodies, and yes, hair on runways, as well as hire and promote designers and behind-the-scenes staff who recognize how to deal with all sorts of styling requirements because they simply interact with or are from differing backgrounds. And clearly, natural hair should and absolutely can be styled in a way that doesn't, as Myers put it, come off "haphazardly": For Myers, she's asking for the courtesy that most other models get de facto:  Read all of Myers's comments here.

 Gucci goes to Rome, Chanel's train station, Dior's Marrakech adventures, Prada in NYC, plus more! Designers get very #extra during the cruise collections, throwing giant extravaganzas in far flung locations around the globe. Cruise, a.k.a. resort, the season between spring and fall whose clothes land in stores around November/December, has all the big designer names participating in these spectacles. From Virginie Viard's first collection for Chanel in the Grand Palais that was transformed into a train station, to Dior infiltrating Morocco and Prada coming to NYC, see below for all of the best looks from the season built for fabulous vacations.  Miu Miu showed at the Bois de Boulogne in Paris‚Äîa racetrack that dates back to 1873. This charming set up, at sunset no less, served as backdrop to a collection that emphasized color, volume, and a great pair of shorts. 1930s inspired dresses with exaggerated details like oversized collars walked alongside "Newsies"-worthy short suits with the hats to match. Grandpa cardigans, striped ankle socks, and saddle bags complete the idea‚Äîwhich was an overall charming look at life at the track.  The Row recently launched its own e-commerce site, a homebase for all of those beautifully distilled pieces. The very essence of all the items you dream of in your closet‚Äîthat leather trench, the pleated skirt, the equestrian jacket that fits like a kid leather glove. Some bold accessories, like a cobalt blue bag, or turquoise, or pink, punctuate these standouts.  It's always a little shocking when a wunderkind turns ten, but there it is, Jacquemus has been in the biz for a decade. To celebrate, Simon Porte showed a Resort Collection on a  fuchsia carpet in a lavender field. Those sexy dresses, bold shouldered jackets, bits of blue, and lace, that the French designer has become synonymous‚Äîand beloved‚Äîfor were all there. As were some short suits and micro bags. He's a designer and a social media star‚Äîa thoroughly modern occurrence ten years in the making.   With languid silk dresses and enough suiting‚Äîdone up in leather, wools, and beyond‚Äîto outfit a proper lady for the foreseeable future, Petar Petrov is proving to be a beacon of sophistication. Designing in Vienna, and showing in Paris, there's a European sensibility and exacting tailoring to looks that are nothing short of a worthwhile investment. These are forever pieces with none of the boring connotations.  Daniel Lee has succeeded in taking a respected atelier with a dedicated customer base and upping its cool factor just enough. Bottega Veneta is a brand for grown-ups, it's not about flash, but it can be about fashion‚Äîand in Lee's hands it most certainly is. Statement trenches in leather and turtlenecks in leather, dresses in leather (you get the idea, the Milanese brand is a leather brand by DNA, after all), have that chic factor that women who buy pieces to last are looking for. Knotted bags and thong sandals finish these minimal, cool, but unfussy looks.  This buzzy designer is consistent proof that simplicity is not synonymous with boring. Her sleek, evening-ready pieces aren't about flash, but they do promote that something special‚Äîa sheer panel here, a twist there. In a sparse palette of black, cream, and silver, it's the shape and details that matter‚Äîand this deft young designer makes them matter.  Polka dots, oversized jackets, a statement blazer‚ÄîTibi is all about the pieces that elevate a woman's wardrobe. They provide that something extra. It's not about standing out, it's about that something special. Color is sparse, but the overall vibe for Resort is still about high impact. Gabriella Hearst looked to strong women as inspiration for Resort, Simone Weil, an early spiritual activist, her own mom, Bo Derek, Patti Smith. The clothes reflect those archetypes in a melding of masculine and feminine‚Äîtea does lace camis and dresses, smart polka dots, tailored suiting, luxe cashmere dresses. Hearst is a fabric fanatic and sustainability has been her mission since day one‚Äîshe does it with a luxury hand that‚Äôs unmatched. In a clever melding of polka dots with studs, Teddy Boy boyishness with '40s Old Hollywood glamour, pumps with bold ankle straps and classic creepers, Michael Kors gave us his version of the vacations season‚Äîthink: polka-dot swim suits, red sequined gowns, and a plaid trench. It's witty and fun, Resort for all-year-round, with a heavy nod to tailoring. Knitwear was also king, with studded cardigans and Irish knits. In other words, the Kors girl is covered for Resort. Clare Waight Keller is a stellar designer as well as a working mom, and it shows. She's dressing women for their actual lives‚Äîwith tailoring for work, great coats, and ultra-feminine eveningwear. For Resort, she put an emphasis on tailoring, a standout military coat, the bold faux furs that the designer has been playing with for seasons, and, of course, those gowns. Consider it a wardrobe for the fashion-forward every-woman.  Lazaro Hernandez and Jack McCollough hit all the high notes: innovative linen suiting, dresses cinched at the waist with leather, little '90s inspired bags with buckle details, pleating on simple white skirts, bold sequined looks, and a shearling that manages to nip in at the waist. These two play with fabric, layering, and jackets that can be worn multiple ways, with buckles, and belts. The palette is simple‚Äîblack, white, tan, a cool shade of yellow‚Äîbut there's nothing straightforwardly simple about this level of design.  Coach is all about the girl who loves a good vintage store find, but done perfectly‚Äîa leather trouser, a billowing tunic dress, a patent leather anorak, the little plaid suit. The brand integrated the "Horse and Carriage" motif, throughout, on bags and tops, to a sort of '70s graphic effect‚Äîall paired with high top trainers and platform boots. In a recent podcast, Cate Holstein said women want three things, "denim, cotton, and cashmere." That formula seems to be working for this minimalist designer. Her pieces are special, feminine, but never overwrought. There are bold sleeves, sleeveless gowns, and a denim pencil skirt we need in our closets right this second. And that's the trick; these are clothes you want to wear every day, not just dream in.  Alessandro Michele made a political statement and showed Gucci's resort collection at the oldest museum in the world, the Musei Capitolini, in Rome last night. Models walked among statues lit by torches, perhaps as a nod to the idea that we might be returning to the dark ages. Women in the U.S. are under attack, with politicians voting to severely limit their reproductive rights, and Michele took the runway as an opportunity for activism. A suit jacket made a statement with My Body, My Choice on the back, and a pretty white dress was embroidered with an image of a uterus on the front. The date 22.05.1978, the day the Italian law protecting legal abortion took effect, popped up on other pieces. There were also beautifully draped gowns that were super feminine and pretty‚Äîa clear message that Michele isn't here just to make women feel beautiful; he'll do his part to get the message out that their rights need to be protected as well. For Ricardo Tisci's Burberry, it's all about the balance‚Äîstreetwear, complete with leopard-print bucket hats, suiting for the corporate ladies, those English tropes that Burberry owns so well (ahem, the trench coat), and a little glitz for an evening out. Lifestyle brand is an overused term, but this season proves Burberry wants to be in your closet for every need and occasion.  For Resort, Tory Burch skipped her past references on the Mediterranean and went a little closer to home‚Äîfarm country in Pennsylvania to be exact, where she spent her summers growing up. A little bit of patchwork, a little embroidery, a fair isle sweater, wildflower florals, and a great shearling plaid coat were just some of the high notes to come out of the inspiration.  Vuitton carted guests all the way to JFK to show off the newly renovated TWA Flight Center, originally designed by the architect Eero Saarinen in 1962. But don‚Äôt expect some standard issue mod collection from the cool fashion master. ‚ÄúI was lucky enough to have landed at the TWA Flight Center in the late Nineties. It was something I could never forget. This place was forgotten for twenty years, and now has come back to life. It‚Äôs like a sanctuary that‚Äôs been revived and seeing it enchant anew in a different iteration, as a hotel, is a great pleasure," says creative director Nicolas Ghesqui√®re. "It‚Äôs about rediscovering of an uncommon place that yet is a part of American heritage,‚Äù he adds of the locale, outfitted with jungle plants for the occasion. The collection celebrates New York City in ways both overt and subtle, with glimmering jackets that looked like the Art Deco Chrysler building, and others with graffiti inspired New York City written out in the back. Pinstriped suits gave a nod to Wall Street from the era that was decidedly the heyday of that famed money strip‚Äîthe 1980s. Bermuda shorts and corsets provided an unexpected silhouette, and peplum skirts are making a comeback. Trousers are belted, high waisted and slim at the ankle, paired with sequined black and silver cropped capes and velvet corset hybrid tops. Of course, there are bags that we need to get a closer look at; was that a screen on one of them? New York is nothing short of cinematic, and while this cinematic locale made an impact, the fashion rose to the occasion.  Virginie Viard came out of the gate for her first collection with a bang. Or perhaps, it's more apropos to say she pulled into the station? The Grand Palais was transformed into a chic train station, complete with Chanel-ready destinations listed like Antibes and Rome. The looks honor the aesthetic of Coco Chanel and Karl Lagerfeld, while putting Viard's stamp subtly throughout. We're still getting to know her, but this Chanel girl has something very cool and a bit mysterious about her‚Äîthose all-over logos, those big bows, the miniskirts. There was the iconic black and white combo, but there was also plenty of color; pink, green, blue, fuchsia, mauve and sky contrasted with deep bister, brown, cobalt, and navy.  We're on board for all of it‚Äîliterally.  Prada came to NYC for the second year in a row and took on the classics through the lens of Miuccia Prada. Men's shirting is transformed into dresses and shorts. Plaid blazers are oversized, socks are ankle length, and there's a tennis sweater worth swooning over. It's a subdued glamour‚Äîthink swing coats, pleated midi skirts, and insouciantly flung scarves, all in go-to shades of navy, pale blue,"Multichromatic" brights, tonal hues, easy whites‚Äîthe brand calls it the push and pull of dichotomies: "Rich and humble, youth versus heritage, uptown versus downtown." Prada girls will love it.  For its Resort 2020 collection, the French fashion house traveled to one of its most stunning locations yet: Marrakech. The Moroccan city not only served as host to Dior's latest runway; its artists and culture helped inspire and create the collection. The theme was "Common Ground," which it sought to achieve through a series of collaborations with several African artists, offering a fresh point-of-view from the storied French fashion house. At a time when the fashion industry is increasingly being called out for cultural appropriation, it was a risky move‚Äîbut Maria Grazia Chiuri aimed for appreciation, not appropriation.  The artistic director tapped Anne Grosfilley, an anthropologist specializing in African textiles and fashion, to consult on the entire collection. Grosfilley helped source fabrics and reinterpret signature Dior motifs with Uniwax, a local manufacturer from Ivory Coast. Several pieces were done in 100% African Wax‚Äîmade from cottons grown, spun, and printed in Africa. Chiuri also enlisted Grace Wales Bonner (a British-Jamaican designer whose work explores a hybrid of European and African fashion) and Mickalene Thomas (a contemporary African-American artist) to reimagine Dior's iconic New Look silhouette. -Lauren Fisher

 The brand will take a direct-to-consumer direction. You won't be seeing Public School at New York Fashion Week in February 2018. Designers Dao-Yi Chow and Maxwell Osborne announced today that they won't present a Fall 2018 collection at NYFW, but will instead adopt a direct-to-consumer approach sometime in Spring 2018, Business of Fashion reports.  You'll still hear from Public School in the meantime, though. The brand will continue to release new products and focus on its collaborations with Nike and Alpha Industries while restructuring. The New York-based brand has already undergone few changes in its fashion week schedule in the past year. In 2016, Chow and Osborne combined the men's and women's collections into one show, and presented only twice a year, in June and December. Instead of presenting during traditional fashion months, the brand debuted new offerings while other labels were debuting pre-season collections.  Public School then returned to the regular NYFW schedule in 2017. Its Fall 2017 range, which debuted this February, famously included a cheeky remix of Trump's staple red cap.  The streetwear label was established in 2008, but started earning acclaim in 2013, after winning both the CFDA Swarovski Award for Menswear and the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund in the same year, BoF reports. In 2015, the design duo was poached by DKNY as co-creative directors. However, the pair stepped down in December 2016 to focus on Public School. Other brands have also bowed out of NYFW, but to show in Paris instead. Altuzarra, for example, showed during Paris Fashion Week in September, while Rodarte and Proenza Schouler presented during Couture Week in July in the French capital.
 A hand-written note to street style star Miroslava Duma has become the center of uproar in the fashion industry.  As Couture Week unfolds in Paris, one designer is finding herself at the center of controversy after using a racial slur.   Russian couture designer Ulyana Sergeenko came under fire for writing a note to blogger and street style star Miroslava Duma that read, "To my n*ggas in Paris." Duma, for some reason thinking the Kanye West line was acceptable for two white women to use, shared a photo of the note on Instagram Stories‚Äîwhich quickly elicited a wave of backlash from the fashion industry and beyond.  The designer was immediately called out by Instagram users and several industry insiders, including Naomi Campbell who tagged Sergeenko and wrote "this better not be real," on Instagram Stories.  This morning, Sergeenko took to Instagram to issue an apology, which in turn, many found to be just as problematic and tone-deaf as the hand-written note. She wrote, "Kanye West is one of my favorite musicians, and NP is one of my favorite songs, and yes, we call each other the N word sometimes when we want to believe that we are just as cool as these guys who sing it.‚Äù After the perplexing explanation, the designer continued in her apology writing, "I am deeply sorry to everyone whom I might have offended. Mira is a dear friend and even the fact that she so naively posted my private card on her social means that we meant nothing wrong and didn't realised [sic] the consequences." But followers and fashion insiders weren't buying Sergeenko's excuse.  Quite possibly the worst apology for casual racism I have ever read, and that‚Äôs really saying something. https://t.co/NRtVIJTNOI This DISGUSTS me. To see Mira post something on IG so casually using this racial slur, and then have Ulyana defend the usage with such a bs excuse makes my blood boil. So tired of ‚Äúfashion girls‚Äù thinking that listening to one rap song gives them the right. pic.twitter.com/P5XHVnNXaX racism in fashion shot // chaser!!! pic.twitter.com/Zo36nA9QjJ Hours later, Duma issued an apology on her own Instagram page, writing that she is "very sorry" and "committed to inclusion and diversity."  She has since been removed from her position as a board member at The Tot, a decision announced Nasiba Adilova on Instagram.  I am deeply saddened and disappointed by the actions of Miroslava Duma at Paris Fashion Week overnight.  We have always held a no-tolerance policy when it comes to any form of racism or discrimination. Power and influence is a privilege and it needs to be carried with humility. I take this immense responsibility very seriously and believe actions speak loudly.  Effectively immediately, Miroslava Duma has been removed from the board of the company @thetot.  I stand by @thetot's decision, and hope this inspires people to consider how their actions and words affect others. A post shared by  Nasiba Adilova (@naseebs) on Jan 23, 2018 at 10:06am PST While fashion may be making small strides towards more racial diversity, this is yet another reminder that there's still a lot of work to be done in the industry. 
 Meet your new favorite influencer.   In the Year of Our Lord 2019 there is no shortage of fashion influencers, but Diane Keaton does not care. She has just discovered the #OOTD selfie on Instagram and now, it's over for the rest of you bitches.   The legendary actress has spent decades giving us iconic style‚Äîfrom on-screen moments like Annie Hall and The First Wives Club to her signature off-screen look of turtlenecks, suits, and top hats. Now, she's gracing Instagram with the fashion content that's been missing in our feeds of perfectly curated blogger posts.  Going with the straightforward caption, "TODAY'S OUTFIT," Keaton has started snapping mirror selfies of her all-black looks. The photos are all filled with comments ranging from "GOALS" to "SNATCHEDT" and "I‚Äôve literally bought that MK belt in every single color thanks to your inspiration." Cut her her influencer check, we will all be wearing black suits, top hats, and combat boots in 2019 now.    After tackling both Hollywood and the wine industry, it's only natural for the 73-year-old to make her foray into the fashion influencer scene now. In fact, the actress made a rare front row appearance at Rodarte's Fall 2019 show in Los Angeles yesterday, letting us all know she's serious about this whole fashun thing.  Sign us up and pour us a glass of Keaton Wine, Diane is the fashion influencer we all need in 2019. 
 Watch a short film featuring special guest Monsieur Christian Louboutin, his friends, and his iconic muse Farida Khelfa. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. Fact: Every good outfit deserves even better heels. The perfect pair can be a wardrobe game-changer no matter where you‚Äôre headed. But which to choose? Below, some of our favorite Christian Louboutin shoes fit for three different rendez-vous.   Another fact: Sometimes, all you need is a really good night out. Christian Louboutin‚Äôs Iriza, with a d‚ÄôOrsay side cut, was practically made for an evening out with the girls (the midi heel is much more conducive to dancing on banquettes than a pair of sky-high stilettos). The only challenge? Choosing between all-over glitter, a graphic print, or classic black patent leather. If you‚Äôre having guests over, resist the urge to go barefoot. The pointed-toe Kate is the perfect classic anchor to any hosting look. The kitten heel adds instant polish to jeans and a sweater; the midi heels pair perfectly with a pleated skirt and silky blouse; and the stiletto puts the finishing touch on a little black dress.  Whether you‚Äôre getting ready for a romantic dinner or keeping it casual at a local bar, a pair of pumps kicks any date-night look up a few notches. And here, there are lots of options: the scalloped Hot Chick stiletto, the Soval pump, or the retro Clare‚Äî pick your favorite and pair with whatever makes you feel like your most irresistible self.
 Brandon Johnson, Kathleen Frey, and Sonne Bajwa saw their ideas come to life at the Harper's BAZAAR ICONS gala. They dreamed of seeing their clothes on the runway. And worn by people everywhere. And one night last month, three young Fashion Institute of Technology (FIT) students‚ÄîBrandon Johnson, Kathleen Frey, and Sonne Bajwa‚Äîsaw their careers take off at the Harper‚Äôs BAZAAR ICONS gala, held at the Plaza Hotel, as they celebrated winning the second annual Infor/FIT Fashion Design ICONS Awards.    ‚ÄúAll my friends are going crazy,‚Äù said Sonne Bajwa, one-half of the duo that won the awards‚Äô business contest. ‚ÄúMy family‚Äôs going crazy.‚Äù Kathleen Frey, Bajwa‚Äôs co-winner would agree: ‚ÄúBeing surrounded by all these people‚Ä¶the energy here is absolutely amazing.‚Äù To say that the event was star-studded would be an understatement. Partygoers included Selena Gomez, The Weeknd, Gigi Hadid, Kim Kardashian West, Kaia Gerber, Ashley Graham, Joan Smalls, Karlie Kloss, Iris Apfel, Kendall Jenner, Heidi Klum, Courtney Love, and Carine Roitfeld‚Äîwho put together the guest list.  Infor, the leading provider of cloud applications for fashion and retail, teamed up with FIT and Hearst Magazines for the awards‚Äîa two-part competition that fosters collaboration between designers and the business teams that advance the creative vision, bringing designs to the closets of multitudes.   The contest was comprehensive. The first round was all about ‚Äúconcept to runway,‚Äù while the second focused on ‚Äúgarment to closet,‚Äù where contenders were challenged to successfully market the winning garment to the world. Johnson, the winner of the design portion of the competition, worked with couturier Paula Versalona to make his multi-piece dress leap from page to reality. Frey and Bajwa‚Äîthe two FIT students in the International Trade and Marketing program who won the business award‚Äîcrafted an ingenious multi-platform plan that addressed the task of selling 1,000 pieces of Johnson‚Äôs design via e-commerce and at 50 Macy‚Äôs stores, using technology such as Infor‚Äôs Customer Experience Suite, in addition to research and market data. They were judged on strategy, persuasiveness, presentation, and feasibility.  And at the gala‚Äîwhich was held on September 8‚ÄîJohnson, Bajwa, and Frey saw everything they worked so hard for come to life: fashion influencer and Friend of a Friend editor-in-chief, Olivia Perez, wore the winning piece for all of the fashion world to see. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so exciting to be here on his [Brandon‚Äôs] behalf and wear his incredible design,‚Äù said Perez.  It‚Äôs clear that these three FIT students went above and beyond to accomplish their aspirations. And this is just the beginning.
 How Svetlana Bevza‚Äôs 13-year-old brand became an Instagram-darling practically overnight.  Svetlana Bevza is not new to the fashion game, but her brand Bevza has certainly hit its stride. After showing collections for over a decade in the Ukraine, Bevza debuted in New York last year and suddenly everything changed. The current crop of celeb style icons like Gigi Hadid and Emily Ratajkowski have pledged their allegiance via some major street style looks, and Sophie Turner single-handedly put Bevza on the mainstream map by wearing a look by the brand during her nuptials weekend to Joe Jonas. The influencer set is on board as well, taking a special liking to a Bevza pearl bra top. ‚ÄúThe idea of seashells and bra tops came to me when I was on vacation with my newborn child and I was baking mussels,‚Äù Bevza explains of the now-Insta famous top. ‚ÄúIt felt like something precious, so I put the pearls in the most sacred place: on the breast.‚Äù  It's this love of women that shows through in each of her minimal, yet special collections. Below, the designer gets into her roots, her goals, and how she really sees a fashion house. Well, first of all, I think that sustainability and consciousness is not a trend, but it's of vital importance. People need to think and have alternatives to real fur because in Ukraine and all the post Soviet countries, due to climate conditions, everybody wears fur. We never used real fur in our label. But the idea to make this puffer look really fashionable, and to make a good alternative to a fur coat came to me two seasons ago. And I wanted to show that people can have puffers that look like iconic fur coats. So I took some famous ones like Carrie Bradshaw's fur coats and Margot Tenenbaum and did that on a digital print‚Äîsome look like a puffer only when you come really close by. Yes, and to make a sustainable women's fashion brand. I want to bring back elegance. There's an overproduction of goods on the market and I want to make things that are timeless, that are not about being popular for one season. I want to create pieces that are considered a good investment. So when you buy a coat, it can be good this season, or five years later. Oh yes! It was a dream from early childhood. I told my mother when I was five that I want to own a fashion house, and I thought it had to be literally a house where my mom could live and help with the wardrobe. So my first sketches were of that house, with the wardrobes, and all the workers ate there, and slept there, and had parties and big dressing rooms. Hah, true! Oh, yeah. I am amazed by that. Bevza is already 13 years old. But when we showed during Ukrainian Fashion Week, we didn't have a lot of international press coverage. But finally, I applied to New York Fashion Week and they told me "Yeah, we liked it! Come on. Let's go."So, right after our first show at New York Fashion Week, we saw big growth on social media because people just saw it and they liked it. Maybe it happened like that because I already had years of practice. Well, after Sophie Turner, I mean all of fashion media wrote about it, internationally. And I am so, so happy that they mentioned the brand when they talked about the wedding.So the interest and brand awareness became much bigger, of course. And that impacts our business a lot. The main thing that we are concentrated on is increasing our production facility and keeping the quality. When I go to the office, five percent of my working time I can do the collections and be creative. And the other time is spent crystallizing the structure the best we can. Before entering New York Fashion Week, I was obsessed with getting Bevza on influencers' radar. And I was thinking how to reach them or how to try to convince them to wear something from Bevza, but right when I gave up on things like that, they just started to write to us and ask to wear our pieces. Of course, when anyone buys Bevza and posts on Instagram,  it sends the message that the product is good, and the design is good. The product starts to sell itself.  NINA @ninauc | BEVZA SS19 Pearl Top | available online on bevza.com A post shared by  BEVZA (@bevza) on Jul 31, 2019 at 7:49am PDT When I hear this question, I feel instantly that she very much is me. The Bevza woman reflects the way I live, the way I think, the way I understand elegance. There is a lot of influence, interest, and inspiration coming from my mom's wardrobe. Specifically, the styling references the generation that grew up on the edge of the '90s in Ukraine.  My dream is that the Bevza woman is one who respects herself, a woman who respects her genuine roots. The nature of women is very beautiful, so the Bevza woman is the one who stands for beauty in all the reflections this word could mean‚Äîbeauty for respecting herself, and beauty in taking care of people she loves, and beauty of the way she speaks or moves. Oh, I'm ambitious. I think Bevza has a chance to become really big. I want every girl to have something, some Bevza in her wardrobe.  SHOP NOW
 The iconic model might be retiring. According to new reports, 2017 may be the last year that Alessandra Ambrosio walks in the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show. The model, who is among the 55 models currently in Shanghai preparing for this year's show, is apparently close to retiring from the VS runway, and fans are devastated. Fashionista is reporting that "If it is her final show, we anticipate her final Victoria's Secret runway appearance to be both a celebration of her incredible work with the brand and a emotion-filled goodbye." The publication cites Instagram fan accounts as the main source of the news, with rumors circulating that Ambrosio wants to focus on other projects. The model has recently been seen on the big screen in Daddy's Home 2.  Fashion blogger Imonation seemed to confirm the news tweeting, "Alessandra Ambrosio will be walking her last VSFS in Shanghai," though no source was referenced for this information.  The 36 year old model first walked the Victoria's Secret runway in 2001, and was selected as PINK's brand ambassador in 2006. Since then, Ambrosio has become renowned for her work with Victoria's Secret. While the model has worked with a plethora of brands including Ralph Lauren and Christian Dior, it's her work with Victoria's Secret that has made her a household name.  If 2017 is Ambrosio's last Victoria's Secret Fashion Show, then the model is sure to outdo her previous appearances, which have included wearing 30lb Jenny Manik Mercian wings, and walking the runway while pregnant.

 The designer opened Ralph's Club, a Jazz Age nightclub, and Mon√°e was its star. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. New York Fashion Week is underway, and Ralph Lauren just created an unexpected experience for guests at his show. Re-creating a Jazz Age-era nightclub in lower Manhattan, the designer opened Ralph's Club for the night, and its entertainment did not disappoint. While the runway showcased the designer's takes on the tuxedo and the red-carpet gown, the stage was taken over by the inimitable Janelle Mon√°e. The Telegraph described Mon√°e's performance as "fierce and funky," revealing that the singer "clambered up onto tables, splashed champagne over the cheering audience and even crawled, Josephine Baker style along the floor and back up onto the stage." Instagram clips captured the energy exuded by the actress and singer, and showcased the stunning tuxedo dress she wore for the performance.

Bella and Gigi Hadid both hit the runway in Ralph Lauren's vintage-inspired designs, much to the delight of the audience. The Telegraph also noted Lauren's inspiration for Ralph's Club as being New York's famous Stork Club. Before it closed its doors in 1965, the jazz venue attracted everyone from Frank Sinatra to Cary Grant to Elizabeth Taylor. Ralph's Club drew famous faces too, including Henry Golding and Cate Blanchett, but it was Mon√°e's night as a jazz icon that won't be forgotten.

 The supermodel designed her own swimsuits for all sizes‚Äîand Bazaar got a behind-the-scenes look.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. Supermodel Ashley Graham didn't take a day off for her 30th birthday. Instead she and seven of her closest friends headed to Costa Rica, where they rented a private villa, to shoot a campaign for Graham's swim line. Graham has been a crusader in the body positivity moment, her first Swimsuits for All campaign, highlighted that plus size women don't always want to hide their bodies‚Äîthey can rock a string bikini with confidence. Graham's new 'Essentials' collection features a variety of bikinis and one-pieces that any woman, any size could feel good in.  Below, we asked Graham about why this collection was important to her, and life lessons for turning 30. Plus, take a behind-the-scenes look at her birthday weekend above. I wanted to offer a range of swimsuit styles that make all women feel confident and sexy. Some traditional brands assume girls with bigger hips, breasts and thighs want to cover up, but I know that's not the case. After my Swimsuits For All #CurvesinBikinis campaign had such a positive response from people everywhere, we knew we had to collaborate on a line to inspire women beyond body positive advertisements.  A string bikini. My mantra, less is more.  Rock your confidence on the outside, just as much as you're rocking that swimsuit! You have to let go of all the silly thoughts like "my cellulite is showing" and realize that everyone has insecurities. The first step to getting over them is taking off that cover up and owning it. It's funny because sometimes I think, 'wait, I'm not already 30?' because I've been working since I was 15. 30 is a whole new decade that I can conquer, and if it's anything like my 20s, it's going to be epic! I love the woman I've become and look forward to inspiring women of all ages for many years to come. Don't take no for an answer. Keep up the hard work, you're making history, girl!  The Swimsuits For All "Essentials" collection is available for pre-order starting today on swimsuitsforall.com. 
 The company has also settled lawsuits with five women accusing Marciano of inappropriate behavior. Guess Inc. has announced that co-founder Paul Marciano is stepping down as executive chairman of the company's board on Monday, months after model Kate Upton accused Paul of sexual harassment and calling her a "fat pig." It‚Äôs disappointing that such an iconic women‚Äôs brand @GUESS is still empowering Paul Marciano as their creative director #metoo Marciano denied Upton's claims and stated, "I have pledged my full cooperation to the company, and I have the utmost confidence in our CEO, Victor Herrero, to continue leading the company during this time."  He was placed on an unpaid leave while Guess and an outside law firm launched an investigation, "which looked into several reports of inappropriate comments and texts along with unwanted kissing and groping." Over the last four months, the investigative team interviewed more than 40 people, reviewed nearly 1.5 million pages of documents, and concluded that, "many of the allegations could not be corroborated." Their findings were released in full in Guess' filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday. However, the filing also states, "The investigation found that on certain occasions [Paul] Marciano exercised poor judgment in his communications with models and photographers and in placing himself in situations in which plausible allegations of improper conduct could, and did, arise." The company said it settled had lawsuits with five of Marciano‚Äôs accusers for a total of $500,000 ‚Äî but, according to the filing, the settlements don't admit fault. Marciano's brother and Guess co-founder, Maurice, will take over the chairman position now that he has stepped down. Marciano will remain on the Guess Inc. board and will continue to serve as the chief creative officer until January 2019, when his contract expires. And, as the Associated Press pointed out, he also owns a 17 percent stake in Guess Inc.

 The best part? You can buy them right now with Apple Pay. Jonathan Simkhai made his handbag debut today at his Spring 2020 show. Presenting four styles; a slouchy hobo, an oversized clutch, a braided messenger bag, and a waist belt, Simkhai hit on all the basics a fashion girl needs right now. The collection complements his penchant for the sporty and the sexy, with minimal styles that feel timeless as well as young and modern. The bags are named "woman" in four different languages to celebrate women across the globe.  "I kept the design aesthetic minimal and made the focus to be about craftsmanship and quality, so they are bags that can be treasured and timeless. My other motto has always been about attainable luxury, which is why we decided to offer the bags directly to our customers," Simkhai told BAZAAR.com. And the best part? He's tapping into the instant gratification of Apple Pay as the exclusive trunk show payment method for the next three weeks.  "If I have something in my shopping cart and go to check out, and they don't take Apple Pay, I usually just give up and leave it in there," said Simkhai. "It's that convenient and safe." The napa and pebbled leather bags are handmade in Italy, but the prices‚Äî$395-$595‚Äî won't break the bank. You can shop the entire collection now at jonathansimkhai.com.

 The space will be used exclusively to present Raf Simons' Calvin Klein seasonal runway collections. In a strategic move to extend the fashion brand's global reach, Calvin Klein Inc. has just opened a brand new headquarters in the fashion-lovers heartland: affectionately, Paris, France.  The new location complements the label's pre-established presence in Milan, building into another European fashion capital. Not only as an extension in appearance, the new HQ presents as a multi-level, captivating, colorful, sculptural, fashion-focused work of art.  Designed by artist Sterling Ruby (Calvin Klein's Chief Creative Officer, Raf Simons' long-time collaborator), with architectural contributions from the Architectural Research Office, the creative space will be used exclusively to present Simons' Calvin Klein women‚Äôs and men‚Äôs seasonal runway collections in Paris. Previously hired by Simons to head the redesign of the Calvin Klein retail press showroom at the company‚Äôs 205 W 39th Street global headquarters on Madison Ave in NYC, Ruby was poised to transform the historical Parisian space into an outstanding artisanal entity.  The two-story Paris redesign features original 1880‚Äôs architecture, providing a backdrop for Ruby‚Äôs hand-painted, splattered canvas designs, which cover the floor-to-ceiling walls and columns of the mezzanine level. Rich royal blue carpet and upholstered walls are punctuated by modern geometric display tables, and custom-created fixtures sprinkle brightly colored pompoms, mobiles, flags, and fringe throughout both the work display areas. Of course, the Calvin Klein collection clothing and accessories are displayed throughout the space, with high-hanging sculptural metal racks housing the clothes, and bright round ceiling-lit pedestals showcase the shoes.    Suffice it to say, if we weren't excited enough to see what the next iteration of Calvin Klein-labeled fashion Raf Simon's whips up next, after seeing his new Parisian dream space‚Äîwe're amped for it.

 See how three celebs handle the final moments before they walked the "Heavenly Bodies" Red Carpet This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. The moments before a major red carpet can be  tense‚Äîlike a bride on her wedding day, but with more cameras and more competition. Alexa Chung, Diane Kruger, and Natalia Vodianova approach that time with utter grace and elegance. The three invited BAZAAR.com into their respective inner sanctums last night before hitting the streets of Manhattan, headed for the Met Gala: Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination. Alexa Chung wore a dress of her own design, paired with glimmering Buccellati jewels, in a look inspired by Anne Boleyn. Natalia Vadianova donned a custom Olivier Rousteing for Balmain gown. Beginning today until May 21st, Vadianova's look will be auctioned at Ifonly.com/RED to raise funds and awareness in the fight against AIDS. Diane Kruger donned a striking blue gown from Atelier Prabal Gurung, complete with a headpiece, Tasaki jewelry and awe-inspiring train. See the ladies before their major red carpet moment. 
 "I think she‚Äôs working non-stop to make it work." Ivanka Trump may be the shoe designer in the First Family, but it was First Lady Melania Trump's choice of shoes while visiting Hurricane Harvey-hit Texas in August that made headlines. The current FLOTUS stepped out in Manolo Blahnik stiletto heels before later changing into sneakers. The internet raised the question if stiletto heels both practically and politically made sense for the occasion. But according to the shoes' designer, who happens to be a friend of the First Lady, who knows what her schedule was like? In an interview with Harper's Bazaar UK, Blahnik shared: The people who have a gold room in their penthouse apartment are absolutely capable of a certain kind of class insensitivity, but it totally makes sense that the White House team didn't consider the optics or non-heel options of the FLOTUS's shoes. That said, Blahnik's understanding begins and ends with Melania:

 We rounded up our favorite looks from New York, London, Milan, and Paris Spring 2020. Whether it's in New York, Milan, or Paris, Fashion Week is a time for sartorial innovation and risks. Here, the fashion editors at Harper's BAZAAR choose their favorite runway looks from the Spring 2020 season and discuss what stood out most to them‚Äîfrom the chic fruits of a carbon neutral show, to diversity and inclusion done well, to McQueen so nice they liked it twice.  Hedi Slimane mines the '60s and '70s with chic pieces for all would-be bourgeois babes. A perfectly proportioned quilted jacket paired with the floral jacquard shoulder bag, layered lariat necklaces, and brass buckle belt make you Rive Gauche-ready. -Nicole Fritton, Executive Fashion Director This show took my breath away‚Äìnot just because of the exquisite beauty of the clothes but also for what the show stood for‚Äìcommunity, responsibility to the planet, connection to each other. But yes, the clothes! The play here on the romantic opulent volume of the dress with the razor sharp tailoring of the jacket is my favorite fashion juxtaposition. Cannot wait to get my hands on it to shoot! -Joanna Hillman, Style Director Diversity and inclusion are buzzwords of the moment cited by many a designer, but one collection that really stuck with me throughout the season was Jonathan Cohen in New York. The designer was born in Mexico City and raised in San Diego and in this collection he beautifully explored his dual heritage. Combining the 50 stars of the American flag with the vibrant rainbow stripes of a Mexican serape blanket, this gown (worn here by Mexican model Isis Jimenez) is a lovely reminder that we are stronger together. -Alison Cohn, Deputy Fashion News Editor There is something so wonderfully timely about returning to craft at this critical juncture in fashion. Jonathan Anderson‚Äôs use of old world crochet here, to create this incredibly modern silhouette, hits just the right note. This isn‚Äôt just a seasonal ‚Äúlook,‚Äù it‚Äôs something to collect and treasure. - Kerry Pieri, Digital Fashion/Features Director  I love the quiet elegance and restraint of this Prada look. It‚Äôs so simple‚Äîyet rendered in the thinnest cashmere and linen, it feels supremely confident and feminine. I love how it‚Äôs worn with the heavier heritage inspired loafers. -Amanda Weiner Alagem, Accessories Director Leave it to Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez to make the Working Girl look feel fresh (and even cooler) for spring. Just when you thought we‚Äôd hit peak ‚Äô80s-inspired blazers, this buttery leather suit completely reinvented the look‚Äîand convinced me that spring leather is, in fact, a thing. Add the sunglasses and double hoop earrings and boom: the Proenza woman remains the coolest in New York. - Lauren Fisher, Market Editor This Dynasty-inspired fur embodies the more glamorous side of Demna's hauntingly visceral spring collection, which was one of the most moving shows of the week! -Joyann King, Executive Editorial Director, Bazaar.com This collection really felt like Riccardo Tisci found his footing at Burberry, blending the classic codes of the iconic British brand along with Tisci‚Äôs signature gothic romance. This unicorn-inspired dress was a standout in the show. I love the sleek silhouette, with the sparkling mesh overlay. The fact that the dress literally had a white feathered tail lent the perfect touch of fashion fantasy. -Chrissy Rutherford, Special Projects Director A visually simple dress is transformed by the complex and rich story it brings with it. Linen woven in a centuries old Irish textile company is decorated with images drawn by school children, which then were embroidered by every single one of the company's employees, including (I'm assuming) model Stella Tenant‚Äôs daughter, who also works there. It resonates with me because‚Äì in a season where the strongest shows presented emotional connections, not just beautiful clothes‚Äìthis artisanal and familial  approach truly makes an utterly modern statement. -Miguel Enamorado, Fashion Director As a brand, Gabriela Hearst continues to lead in the realm of sustainability and this season even had an industry first‚Äîa carbon neutral show. Truly a commendable feat. What distinguishes her line is not merely her inimitable practices, but her deliberate use of ethically sourced, elevated materials mixed with her attention to craft via handworked details throughout the collection. Cue the perfect Spring suit cinched at the waist with a striking geode-buckle belt, for a chic take on this classic silhouette, that will sustain your wardrobe for seasons to come. -Jaclyn Alexandra Cohen, Fashion & Accessories Editor
 At her weekend home in the Hamptons, the designer embraces her sporty side. 7:00 A.M. I‚Äôm more of an early riser than my sons, so mornings at my Southampton house are peaceful. My beauty routine is low-key‚ÄîI might do a swipe of Nars mascara and Charlotte Tilbury pinky-nude lipstick‚Äîbut I love being outdoors, and I always put on sunscreen. I‚Äôll throw on Tory Sport track pants and an oversize sweater, and go work in my garden. I‚Äôm not winning any prizes for what I grow, but I find it therapeutic.  8:00 A.M. I play a lot of tennis, so I had a sunken court put in, which makes it easy to get in an early game with friends. We‚Äôll play a couple of sets, and then I‚Äôll relax with green tea and a good book. I‚Äôm currently reading James A. Michener‚Äôs historical novel Hawaii.  10:00 A.M. My twins, Henry and Nick, and my youngest, Sawyer, come find me in the garden. They‚Äôre not big on breakfast foods, but I‚Äôve discovered that one healthy thing they‚Äôll eat is salad. I‚Äôll toss lettuce with olive oil, lemon juice, and feta.  11:00 A.M. Often we‚Äôll go for an ocean swim next. Henry and Nick love to surf, and Sawyer prefers fishing, crabbing, and clamming.  "I think it‚Äôs really important to eat dinner with your children; you can learn a lot from them." 1:00 P.M. I have a big family, so the lunch table is usually set by the pool with Dodie Thayer for Tory Burch Lettuce Ware. Whoever shows up, shows up. There are my boys, and sometimes my three stepdaughters, my fianc√©, Pierre-Yves Roussel, and his three sons as well. We‚Äôll barbecue fresh fish and veggies, and bake margherita pies in the outdoor pizza oven. Right now I‚Äôm focused on Embrace Ambition, a forum that confronts gender stereotypes that hold women back. I‚Äôm hosting one later this month, so my foundation president might drop by. It‚Äôs nice to get a few things done, and also to get the kids talking about these issues.  3:00 P.M. Some afternoons we‚Äôll just sit by the pool. I remember when I was growing up, my mom, Reva, would always yell, ‚ÄúHappy feet!‚Äù when I needed to get moving. I also enjoy antiquing for unusual bits of pottery and porcelain at little shops around the East End.  7:00 P.M. Dinner is also pretty casual. We‚Äôll start with hors d‚Äôoeuvres on the back porch, and people just come when they come. I think it‚Äôs really important to eat dinner with your children; you can learn a lot from them. Mine have great insights about Tory Sport, as their friends are wearing it, both young men and women.  9:00 P.M. We‚Äôll usually unwind by watching a movie together, then we all go to bed at different times. For the boys, that‚Äôs like 3 a.m. Me, I‚Äôll light our Westerly scented candle‚Äîit‚Äôs a jasmine, gar- denia, and pink pepper blend‚Äîand run a bath with rose oil from Buly 1803. I‚Äôm asleep by midnight. ‚ÄúI was over the moon when my favorite potter agreed to reissue her 1960s Palm Beach classics with us.‚Äù Dodie Thayer for Tory Burch pitcher, $148, toryburch.com. ‚ÄúAll net proceeds from our Embrace Ambition bracelets support women entrepreneurs through the Tory Burch Foundation.‚Äù Tory Burch bracelets, $30 each, toryburch.com. ‚ÄúOur Coolmax cashmere blend is a super-lightweight performance fabric that keeps me dry‚Äîand warm.‚Äù  Tory Sport sweater, $278, torysport.com. ‚ÄúThis versatile bag has a removable compartment for my racquets.‚Äù  Tory Sport multi-racquet tote, $398,  torysport.com. ‚ÄúMy mom has always been vigilant about SPF, and her skin is still beautiful today.‚Äù  Shiseido Ultimate Sun Protection Lotion WetForce SPF 50+, $40, shopBAZAAR.com.

 We need to visit ASAP. An Yves Saint Laurent museum has opened in Paris, featuring the brand's most iconic looks and the eponymous couturier's official design studio. The launch takes place nearly three weeks after the death of YSL co-founder Pierre Berg√©, who passed away on September 8 at the age of 86. He was dedicated to finding a permanent home for Saint Laurent's archives. The first room focuses on the designer's masculine-meets-femine designs, including the Le Smoking tuxedo, a trenchcoat and Saharienne jacket, according to WWD. The rest of the space will highlight "the development of a collection," featuring a few looks from Saint Laurent's first two seasons under his eponymous label in 1962, which will be updated every year. Another section showcases intricately-crafted jackets, while a different room celebrates YSL's exotic influences. In the reception area, photos and paintings of Saint Laurent hang on the walls, including Andy Warhol's famous pop-art portraits of the late designer. The exhibit is currently only being shown in previews, but officially opens to the public next week on October 3. The inaugural exhibit will be on display until September 9, 2018. A single full-priced ticket costs ‚Ç¨10 (about $11.80). Plan your visit here. YSL fans that can't make it to France shouldn't fret; another Saint Laurent museum is set to open in Marrakech on October 19. Click through for a sneak-peek inside the exhibit.

 Kim Kardashian West and almost the entirety of every Yeezy Collection has Lady Di to thank. You can hardly get through a summer Saturday morning Insta-story session without seeing at least three photos of Princess Diana circa 1995 in a logo sweatshirt, dad sneakers, and bike shorts‚Äîserving the ultimate fitspo with her tanned, toned legs. It seems that her casual daywear look is a consistent mood right now, more so than her more famed elegant attire.  You know what else features a sweatshirt, dad sneakers, and bike shorts? Every Yeezy Collection by Kanye West, including his most recent. The campaign images for Yeezy Season 7 (107? who can keep count), photographed by Eli Linnetz, and released in mid-June,  look like a sepia-toned version of the oft-photographed Lady Di's go-to workout look in the mid-nineties.  Those Yeezy Boost 350 V2 are even paired with tube socks that are very similar to what the royal wore. Princess Diana served as fashion inspiration throughout her life and for as long as she has been deceased. And while it's a delight, but not a shock, when designers like Virgil Abloh create an entire season inspired by her bold-shouldered dresses, pencil skirts, and off-the-shoulder gowns, her laid-back post-workout daywear serving as a constant reference is less expected. Kim Kardashian and her kin have taken the bike short trend everywhere from the club to school drop-off, trading Princess Diana's purple for gray and dropping the Virgin Atlantic logos in favor of a more straight-forward look in muted tones. Perhaps it's time to put the USA sweatshirt back in rotation and stop off at Target for bike shorts with a little personality.

 Hollywood's brightest new star plays fashion model in Max Mara‚Äôs new luxe fall coats. One of Hollywood's brightest new stars strolls into the cookie shop across from her Brooklyn apartment with a warm smile, arms outstretched. She‚Äôs casually dressed for the humid summer afternoon in crisp head-to-toe white, which accentuates her striking blue eyes against long rust-colored locks, dyed for her role in the cyber-thriller series Mr. Robot.  Over tea, the actress, Grace Gummer, is friendly and totally at ease‚Äîa far cry, she says, from earlier in the week, when she stepped into the role of fashion model for a  shoot to celebrate Women in Film, a nonprofit organization that promotes equal opportunities for women in the entertainment industry. ‚ÄúI really understand why supermodels are paid a gazillion dollars,‚Äù says Gummer, 31. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs 95 degrees, and I‚Äôm wearing wool pants and cashmere sweaters, cars coming in every direction, and the photographer is like, ‚ÄòSmile, okay, back, front, turn around, and hop in the air.‚Äô‚Äâ‚Äù Modeling may be out of the ordinary for her, but playing a character comes far more easily. The actress portrays the brash FBI field agent Dominique ‚ÄúDom‚Äù DiPierro in Mr. Robot, which starts its third season on the USA Network this month. To prep for the part, Gummer shadowed real FBI agents, and says the show‚Äôs plot has left her with a healthy dose of paranoia (Dom is out to stop a hacker hell-bent on bringing down corporate America). ‚ÄúI use encryption apps for texts and calls,‚Äù she says. As for the hair, ‚ÄúI like it red. People notice me more, and I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs necessarily for my work.‚Äù The Italian luxury fashion brand Max Mara‚Äîa longtime partner of the annual Women in Film Max Mara Face of the Future Award, which honors the young generation of stars on the rise, embodied by Gummer‚Äîwould no doubt disagree. ‚ÄúGrace is an actress who combines a strong talent with a playfulness, originality, and intelligence that‚Äôs also expressed through her style,‚Äù says Maria Giulia Maramotti, Max Mara‚Äôs director of retail. Gummer, who studied art history and Italian at Vassar, considered becoming a costume designer until a theater- director friend sent her a script and she decided she‚Äôd rather say the lines than create the clothes. She caught her first big break in 2011, in the Broadway revival of which led to roles in high-profile TV shows like The Newsroom, American Horror Story: Freak Show, and Good Girls Revolt, and  in which she portrayed a young Nora Ephron. (Incidentally, Gummer‚Äôs mother, Meryl Streep, a close friend of the late writer-director, also played a version of Ephron, in the lightly fictionalized 1986 film Heartburn.) "Grace is an actress who combines a strong talent with a playfulness, originality, and intelligence that‚Äôs also expressed through her style,‚Äù says Maria Giulia Maramotti of Max Mara. The actress has two projects coming up on the big screen. ‚ÄúI just filmed Beast of Burden with Daniel Radcliffe,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a very cool, Bonnie and Clyde‚Äìstyle crime thriller.‚Äù She‚Äôs also dipping her toes into comedy with The Long Dumb Road. ‚ÄúIt was just after the election, and I wanted to laugh and make other people laugh. I‚Äôll do whatever I can get my hands on that means and says something important to the world.‚Äù Asked who is on her director wish list, she is quick to name Paul Thomas Anderson (‚Äúlike a dream‚Äù) and Kelly Reichardt (‚ÄúI want to work with more women‚Äù). And she finds inspiration in contemporaries Carey Mulligan, Sarah Paulson, and Claire Danes. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre my friends, but I also love their work.‚Äù Now that her career is taking off, Gummer says her wardrobe has had to play catch-up. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt go to work in sweatpants anymore,‚Äù she says, laughing. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a little bolder now. Maybe it‚Äôs the hair.‚Äù  Lead image: Max Mara Atelier coat, sweater, pants, sunglasses, and bag; New Balance sneakers; Hair: Tommy Buckett for Garnier; Makeup: Justine Purdue for Charlotte Tilbury; Production: The Lovely Works.

 A totally casual summer essential.  Last week, Bella Hadid and Alexander Wang landed a truly unexpected campaign as the new faces of Magnum Ice Cream. The designer and model lent their fashion prowess to the ice cream brand, posing fiercely with some Magnum bars, as you of course do.  Along with their campaign images and video, the duo also teased a "big announcement" at Cannes Film Festival this week. Would Bella be accessorizing with Magnum bars on the red carpet? Would Alexander Wang be designing a red carpet gown made entirely of Magnum ice cream bar wrappers for the model? While sadly neither of those things happened, Wang and Magnum did announce a new collaboration in Cannes today: a $995 black leather Alexander Wang cooler. Yes, finally: a cooler that matches your true aesthetic and is willing to sweat to death wearing all black, despite the fact that it's summer and hot AF outside.  Can you believe we've made it this long without black leather Alexander Wang coolers in our lives? We've been toting our food in dainty little baskets and doing picnics wrong this entire time. Imagine if only Julie Andrews had gotten her hands on one of these Wang coolers for The Sound of Music:  Total game-changer. Now we can all be downtown party girls while basking in an outdoor picnic and really, what more could you ask for? While $995 may be slightly outlandish for a cooler, can you really put a price on looking like this while eating ice cream?   I rest my case.  SHOP THE ALEXANDER WANG X MAGNUM COOLER
 Tommy Hilfiger and Gigi Hadid take on London Fashion Week with a "Rock Circus" show. For the third season in a row, Gigi Hadid and Tommy Hilfiger joined forces on a see-now, buy-now fashion show. Making their London Fashion Week debut, the duo staged their Fall 2017 collection with the Tommy Now Rock Circus. From the star-studded attendees to acrobatic dancers and more, here's what went down at Tommy x Gigi in London tonight.  1) Gigi, Bella, and Anwar Hadid opened the show. For the first time ever, the model siblings all walked the same show‚Äîwalking out one after one in order of oldest to youngest for the first three looks.  2) The runway was a rock concert meets circus. Including stadium-like seating and a giant stage that models entered via a red, white, and blue staircase.

 We chat with Tracy Georgiou about menswear, the trick to finding the perfect pair of vintage jeans, and how her love of musical theater influences her personal style.     In this series for Harper‚Äôs Bazaar, I will be ‚Äúoutfit dissecting‚Äù women who work behind the scenes in the fashion industry. The women you will meet in these profiles work for some of your favorite brands, and whether they‚Äôre designing the pieces you love or answering your DM questions, they are also quietly cultivating trends. Tracy Georgiou.  ‚ÄãI am a merchandiser and marketer for Loeffler Randall. I work with our team in order to develop collections, buy them, and market them. I don‚Äôt know if I could! What I love about what I do is that every day is different and I‚Äôm working on a hundred things at once. To a toddler, I probably would just tell them I run around an office all day, very happy and inspired, with a bunch of really cool women.  ‚ÄãI am! I‚Äôm super creative, and I‚Äôm super analytical. My parents are both economists, so I grew up in a very kind of focus-metered home in Nebraska. And then I have this other part of my personality that is just super creative, loves to do musical theater, and dance. So for me, an awesome day is a day that merges both of those. Which I think is why I love merchandising. Why I love what I‚Äôm doing is because you get to do a lot of both. You look at the business and analyze what‚Äôs going on, and you get to dream about creating the next thing.   I think so, in just that I was so removed from the fashion sphere. J.Crew was my idea of high fashion growing up. The catalog would come in the mail and I‚Äôd dog-ear the pages. I grew up in the Delia‚Äôs era, so I didn‚Äôt grow up online. I didn‚Äôt grow up looking at fashion magazines. That really wasn‚Äôt until college when I came to NYC that my horizons were broadened to that point. I always had this very innate view of what I wanted my personal style to be. I remember every school year starting out, and the year where all I wanted were flannel shirts and turtlenecks. The summer where I only wanted to wear printed shorts with matching T-shirts. Or the Dr. Martens phase with a certain color of socks and certain color twinset. I was always incredibly specific and had this real inner vision dictated by who knows what! I think I still am very much the same way. I really get on a track and it works, and then I press repeat and I continue. I think I‚Äôve always been super curious, so inspiration personally for me is never limited to x, y, and z fashion, it‚Äôs always been a refraction of everything around me.   ‚ÄãIt‚Äôs funny, because my mom sent me a photo of myself wearing velvet loafers, white socks, kind of baggy gym shorts, and a cool white T-shirt. I was like, ‚ÄúOoh, good look, I would wear that right now!‚Äù So I think, yeah, it‚Äôs always been a high-low mix for me.    My necklaces, they are something I wear every day. The stone is an ametrine from a gem healer in India that was prescribed for me. I hope it‚Äôs doing great things! It was a really special trip with one of my best friends. And then, ‚ÄãUrte Tylaite‚Äã, who owns the brand Still House, did the setting for it, which is lovely. The rest are a bunch of charms from treasured friends, all sorts of things I‚Äôve picked up along the way. One of my best friends at work got me a protective metal for my dog. I have a zodiac charm. I have a T [charm] that I picked up on the street in Mexico when I was there earlier this year. A Jessica Winzelberg charm. And a seashell I just got at a flea market in Paris. Tomgirl is probably the best way to describe it. But I think it‚Äôs a little more irreverent than that. I like to think I could be a character in a Woody Allen or Wes Anderson film, or dress like Woody Allen or Wes Anderson themselves. I think my love of theater and storytelling informs my style. There are moments when I want to be super feminine or moments when I want to be super masculine. And a whole lot of days in the middle where I just end up wearing a T-shirt and jeans. I'm always looking for things that feel good on my body and make me feel a certain way. I know myself well enough to know I dress for comfort. And if it‚Äôs not comfortable, it‚Äôs not going to last in my closet. I‚Äôm a perennial closest purger, and only the really good, really comfortable, really versatile things stay. Or the vintage pieces that are very special, the jeans that fit perfectly; the good stuff sticks around.  In terms of personal style, I build my wardrobe around Loeffler Randall because ‚Ä¶ accessories! A ton of vintage‚ÄîI love American vintage. I love going to Le Vif in Paris, The Vintage Showroom in London, and Front General in New York City. Anywhere I go, I vintage shop! If I‚Äôm not wearing vintage, I love small designers, people that I‚Äôm friends with, or companies that I feel really good about supporting. Some current favorites are Demylee, Alex Mill, Clare Vivier, Batsheva, Caron Callahan, B Sides, Kule, SZ Blockprints, and Innika Choo. The Cotton & Modal Tee (from Alex Mill) is the best, the sleeves are the perfect length.  ‚ÄãOh, yeah, for sure. I had plenty of crazy, possibly terrible, style moments growing up. Watching a ton of Sex and the City and dreaming about New York definitely led to some fashion moments and some attempts. I went through a real skater phase, which I still partially live in, because I do love a checkered slip-on Van. I think I‚Äôve carried pieces of these experiments with me. I still do a lot of community theater in my free time, and getting dressed for a role is one of my favorite parts of the storytelling. So I think I personally take that on as well. I try for a role to wear something I would never wear in real life. It makes it more fun, it makes it easier to step outside my life.   I was but not in an extreme way. Pretty practical. We made our own Halloween costumes; I wish I had some of those calico prairie dresses now! Laura Ingalls Wilder was very cool in Nebraska!  ‚ÄãI think one of the things that really informs my style is travel. I love to travel, and I love to shop when I travel. Whether it is the local vintage store or the local flea market, or some sort of artisan, designer, garment that is culturally relevant to that place. I‚Äôll pick up a men‚Äôs guayabera shirt in M‚ÄãeÃÅrida o‚Äãr an embroidered blouse when I went to the Y‚ÄãucataÃÅn‚Äã. And now that is worn with ‚Äô70s Levi‚Äôs and ballet flats, it feels very different than with a bathing suit on vacation. Maybe this belt I‚Äôm about to buy from the Hesperios store! A lot of my purchases are impulse purchases, I think you have to accept that as a vintage shopper.‚Äã ‚ÄãI will occasionally go in meditating on something I want to find, very rarely do I find it. This jacket, actually, I was in France and knew I was going to a vintage store called Le Vif. And in my head, I really wanted to complete that ‚Äústick-of-butter look.‚Äù I really wanted a tan denim jacket, and the universe threw me a bone. It was fate, we were meant to be together! But 99.99 percent of the time, it‚Äôs just a gut purchase.    I think I go through phases. Right now I‚Äôm looking at old photos of Ali MacGraw and Jean Seberg. I asked a friend to describe my style and they said, ‚ÄúPerfect jeans, lively top, flat shoes, and a good handbag.‚Äù I think that really sums it up. I went to see ‚ÄúThe Cher Show,‚Äù and for weeks after that, I was like, ‚ÄúI need rhinestone earrings and a diamant√© belt!‚Äù So I think whatever I‚Äôm seeing and what‚Äôs in my immediate consciousness ends up seeping in, rather than one tent-post movie for me. Definitely the ‚Äô60s right now. Really good jeans. I‚Äôm really interested in the khakis, the putties. Today I was looking at images from Pitti online, and I saw a man in a forest green suit with a buttercream yellow piped pajama shirt and a maroon baseball hat. The color combination blew my mind. I absolutely think being in the ‚Äô60s/‚Äô70s would be a dream. I think I would dress like a similar version of myself, but all the clothes would be new and in stores! They wouldn‚Äôt be vintage, it would be so fun! I‚Äã don‚Äôt think so. It‚Äôs funny you ask that, and I immediately think of Midnight in Paris, and, you know, I would go back and I would tell you I wouldn‚Äôt buy vintage. But everyone would be wistful and buying vintage from the ‚Äô20s and ‚Äô30s and saying they wanted to live there. I think it would be great to go back to that era with the music and the style. There is something so very restrained and particular that I really like about those eras.  
 Emily Ratajkowski, Jourdan Dunn, Elsa Hosk and more love this affordable line. For years the model-off-duty look has largely followed the same formula: a black leather motorcycle jacket, add black skinny jeans plus the must-have boot or bag of the season. Alana Pallister is changing the game though with her new supermodel-approved clothing line, I.AM.GIA. The Aussie-born designer plays with masculine and feminine pieces, from baggy chinos to itty-bitty crop tops. She's even upgraded the tracksuit, giving it a bolder and cooler feel with vibrant color-blocking. Now, everyone from Kaia Gerber to Bella Hadid are rocking I.AM.GIA, it's even become the unofficial uniform of Victoria Secret Angels like Elsa Hosk, Candice Swanepoel and Jasmine Tookes. At such an affordable price, (most pieces go for cost less than $100) anyone can dress like their favorite model-of-the-moment. We caught up with the founder/designer to talk about the vision for creating a cult brand.  The inspiration behind I.AM.GIA was to create a phenomenon that would completely change the fashion game. I wanted my brand to be the influence to empower every woman to take on the world.  GIA | @emrata in the polaris set | online now | #IAMGIA A post shared by  I AM GIA (@iamgia) on Dec 6, 2017 at 9:43pm PST The name Gia comes from the character I created, a strong and independent woman. When I first started to think about who she was, I was inspired by Gia Carangi, the first ever supermodel of her time. She was an absolute phenomenon and embodied the essence of what I.AM.GIA is all about.  GIA | @gabcurrent in the GIA hoodie | online now | #IAMGIA A post shared by  I AM GIA (@iamgia) on Nov 27, 2017 at 8:24pm PST The ‚ÄòI.AM.‚Äô at the start of the name is also very important. When customers wear the clothes, we want them to truly become Gia and to say: ‚ÄòI am strong, I am powerful, I am an absolute badass‚Äô. The initial design process for my first company was always a lot of trend research, forecast and following the latest color palettes. With Gia, we don‚Äôt try to stay on top of trends, which in turn has created trends. The most important thing for us is the story of what Gia is doing in her life. I always put myself in Gia‚Äôs shoes when designing for her and think ‚ÄúWhat would she want to wear?‚Äù Diversity is so important because we don‚Äôt ever want Gia to be typecast. She is every woman. Some girls will wear a Gia piece with a pair of heels, some girls will wear a Gia piece with a combat boot ‚Äîand either way is just as cool. I want the I.AM.GIA girl to be an advocate for going against the grain and being true to yourself. She is a strong, independent badass. She is every woman. There are so many movies I draw inspiration from. The movie Gia is naturally one of my favorites. I also love Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill, Mad Max, A Clockwork Orange, Girl Interrupted, Trainspotting, Moulin Rouge, Runaways, The Matrix and Tomb Raider.  GIA | @_dilone wears the Smurfette Boiler | Online Now | #IAMGIA A post shared by  I AM GIA (@iamgia) on Nov 13, 2017 at 1:19am PST Numerology is also a really important thing for me. Around the time I was creating Gia, I kept seeing the numbers 444 occur. When I looked at the clock, it would be 4:44. When I checked Instagram it would be 444 likes on this photo. In numerology, 444 resonates very highly in building solid foundations. It‚Äôs known as a confirmation from your angels that you are on the right path. 444 is on so many Gia pieces because we also want to remind our Gia women that they are on the right path and to always trust in that.

 You're going to want a pair.  Snow boots haven't always been known to be the chicest of footwear options‚Äîthey're often dark and clunky. However, Chlo√© has taken on the challenge to make all-weather boots chic. Sorel tapped the storied French house to reimagine their classic footwear.   The final product? A suede and shearling ankle boot,  gold buttons and fringe laces adding Chlo√©'s signature touch of French cool. You can up your winter footwear game with a pair come November, the boots will retail for $515 at Chlo√© boutiques, Neiman Marcus, Saks and Bloomingdales.   Sorel and Chlo√© also tapped Sofia Sanchez de Betak to show off just how cool the new boot looks out in the wild‚Äîwhether you're hanging by a lake, or camping, or trudging through snow in the city‚Äîthese boots are the answer.
 Is this the uniform for toppling the patriarchy? When no one was paying attention, the high-fashion streetwear trend died. Rest in peace, over-priced  hoodies‚Äîyou no longer have a corner on the fashion market. The death knell? When Diet Prada, that Instagram account of savage truth, spotted Vetements sweatshirts and T-shirts on super sale for 80% off across the Internet. We‚Äôre talking about the end of the inflated, high fashion version of so-called ‚Äústreetwear,‚Äù the Calabasas-ification of a legitimate, born-in-America look that has evolved over decades as the cultural bi-product of an urban environ, musical genres like blues, rap and hip hop, and varying forms of art and film. While luxury fashion brands that trade in logo hoodies are hitting the sales rack, a new, unabashedly girly vibe has taken over. Think florals, Victoriana and puff sleeves. Femininity at its baseline. The mood in fashion has taken a complete 180, where you‚Äôre more likely to see your favorite neighborhood fashion blogger in a $300 floral dress than track pants that cost somewhere in the quadruple digits. On the Fall 2018 runways, you have Calvin Klein‚Äôs gingham maxis, Fendi‚Äôs white lace dresses,  Rodarte layered tulle, Oscar de la Renta‚Äôs epic return to gowns, Chloe‚Äôs cut-out white lace, Chanel‚Äôs literal romp through the forest. But this trend isn‚Äôt really about the runway. The fashion fairy nymphs filling up your social feeds are more often than not clad in direct-to-consumer, dress-heavy brands like LoveShackFancy, Doen, Reformation, Faithfull the Brand, or their French counterparts Rouje and S√©zane.  While sneakers of the Balenciaga, Vuitton and Gucci variety continue to sell in record numbers, when is the last time you saw a $2,000 sweatsuit on someone in person, let alone on your social media feed? The return to flagrant femininity follows women‚Äôs marches that turned out record-breaking numbers, the rise of pink pussy hats and the #MeToo era. Are women rejecting the notion that you need to dress and act like men in order to get ahead? ‚ÄúIt is popular knowledge that in the 1980s women took up a boxy, big-shouldered silhouette and the stylistic details of traditional menswear tailoring to fashion their entrance into the corporate world of work,‚Äù Rachel Lifter, assistant professor of fashion studies at Parsons School of Design told BAZAAR.com. ‚ÄúIndeed, the power suit of the working girl‚Äîto borrow the title of the iconic 1988 film‚Äî is probably the most recognizable symbol of fashionable feminism.‚Äù Lifter attributes the move towards ultra-femininity with a renewed refusal to participate in bourgeois society‚Äîa return to historical bohemia, which dates back to the early 19th century. ‚ÄúThe bohemian style‚Äîthrough dress and behavior‚Äîcontinues to influence fashionable femininities,‚Äù she explains. ‚ÄúThink the sartorial style of pop performers like Florence Welch, the enduring legacy of Stevie Nicks as a style icon, and the ‚Äòboho chic‚Äô Coachella look, among other examples.‚Äù Perhaps it‚Äôs a way for women to rebel against an increasingly hostile cultural conversation‚Äîthe constant threat of overturning Roe v. Wade, the nomination of a conservative, anti-choice Supreme Court justice, and a sitting president who has a history of abusive behavior and language towards women. Or, perhaps women just want to put on a pretty dress and possibly frolic in an open field of lavender after so many seasons of masculine suiting and oversized sweatshirts. Rebecca Hessel Cohen, founder of floral-friendly, ethereal ready-to-wear brand LoveShackFancy, is in the camp that women are simply ready to lean into their feminine natures again. ‚ÄúI think women are confident, powerful and comfortable being ultra-feminine and romantic again. Now is a time when you can be all these things together‚Äîit‚Äôs not about a power suit but instead about a flowy dress that exudes femininity and makes you feel dreamy, magical, sexy and powerful all in one,‚Äù says Hessel Cohen. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an ode to the past. It‚Äôs heritage. Everything is moving so quickly in this world, so maybe this brings back a traditional sensibility‚Äîa time when handwork and attention to detail were so important.‚Äù The five-year-old brand has blown up in recent months, experiencing exponential sales growth according to Hessel Cohen and increased visibility (if our Insta feeds are any indication) so she must be onto something. On her podcast Juicy Scoop, comedienne Heather McDonald talked about her recent trip to the East End of Long Island and the general style vibe she witnessed there. Everyone had on ‚Äúthese flowy dresses that kind of make it look like you can be a polygamist, if you were in Utah, if you are in the Hamptons you wear it with $700 Gucci tennis shoes.‚Äù But no one says it better than Gloria Steinem herself. When asked what she wears to feel like ‚Äúthe queen of business and a rad bitch,‚Äù Steinem famously told Lena Dunham: "[I like to wear] something that has a resonance from the past before patriarchy came along." In that case, a wispy maxi floral sounds like just the uniform for women ready to topple the patriarchy‚ÄîBalenciaga Triple S‚Äôs optional.

 üòçüòçüòç In the past few years, many fashion houses have started switching from showing the traditional ready-to-wear seasons at fashion week to a "see now, buy now" model, where items are available straight off the runway instead of waiting a few months to hit stores. This idea makes sense to me, but I've never had a particular feeling about it, until today, when Tod's showed its fall 2018 show in Milan, because models carried puppies down the runway and I SEE NOW, WANT TO BUY RIGHT VERY NOW! Not every model was blessed with a dog‚ÄîGigi's sister, Bella, walked the show sans puppy: Which...literally how could you walk an entire runway knowing your sister was getting to do it with THIS GUY: Gigi has particular experience carrying French Bulldogs places: Her boyfriend, Zayn Malik has a Frenchie.  Anyway, I have never wanted something to be off a runway and in my hands more than the guy Gigi is holding‚Äîmostly because I have a long, semi-pathetic history of desperately wanting a French Bulldog, or, as I like to call them, Potatoes‚Ñ¢, but again, because HOW CAN YOU RESIST THIS: While we're at it, I'd also take that jacket, gorgeous bag and cozy zip-up Gigi's wearing, but, you know.

 As the greatest film franchise in the galaxy rolls out its latest episode, The Last Jedi, the planet‚Äôs top models explore the original trilogy‚Äôs many worlds.  If you‚Äôve picked up a piece of Star Wars merchandise in the past ten years, you can thank Brian Rood: since the release of Episode 3, the illustrator has been responsible for defining and guiding the visual style fans of the franchise know and love. Here at Harper‚Äôs Bazaar, we know a thing or two about having a reputation for iconic imagery‚Äîso we enlisted Rood‚Äôs help in today‚Äôs supermodel ‚Äústar wars‚Äù by asking him to cast the industry‚Äôs reigning catwalk queens in classic scenes from the franchise. (To wit: Kaia Gerber pulling a Princess Leia amid Hoth‚Äôs snowy tundra, or the Hadids emerging from the Millennium Falcon.) Working from his studio in Michigan, Rood walked us through his artistic process and told us what it was like to draw Taylor Hill storm(troop)ing the gangway of the Death Star. Harper's Bazaar: You‚Äôve played such a big role in determining the modern visual style of Star Wars. How much of that came from your style as an artist and how much of it came from LucasFilm? Brian Rood: Honestly, a lot of it has been a huge jambalaya of a little bit of them and a little bit of me. I mean, obviously, you get art directed pretty extensively when you‚Äôre dealing with a property like Star Wars‚Äîyou don‚Äôt really get free reign to do with it as you wish. But I‚Äôve been working with LucasFilm for the better part of 13 or 14 years, and some of the stuff I‚Äôve done in the past with the fine art line is very much something I get to develop as long as it gets approved by them and I don‚Äôt take the property in weird directions.   HB: What year did you come on board the franchise? BR: What year did I try to start working with them or what year did I actually? [laughs] From the very beginning [of my career], I wanted to work with LucasFilm, so I really politely pestered and hounded and tried to put myself in the right place at the right time where the right people were having dinner. So I politely pursued them for probably close to a decade, and right before episode 3 came out was when I got my foot in the door with the first official Star Wars gig. It definitely went above and beyond anything I ever thought‚Äînever in a million years did I think it was going to be this ongoing thing. It‚Äôs like a dream come true. HB: Yeah, you‚Äôre the guy now. And the remarkable thing about your work is that it feels very modern but it‚Äôs still a continuation of the same style as the illustrations from the original movies. BR: I‚Äôm stoked you recognize that. That‚Äôs something I had in the back of my mind, for instance, when we started the storybook project. I‚Äôm essentially doing an illustration for every minute and a half of screen time‚Äîit‚Äôs about 100 illustrations per film that I‚Äôve done now for episodes 1 through 7. I‚Äôm in the stages now of working and finishing up Episode 8‚Äôs storybook. So we‚Äôre talking close to 1,000 illustrations in total, and they needed to look very familiar style-wise to what people have seen before, but we tried to breathe a little new life into it as well so it would appeal to the kids nowadays too as well. HB: How did you go about developing that style with an eye towards the heritage of the franchise? BR: On accident. [laughs] Being such a slave to photo reference, that‚Äôs the beginning part of the process for me. I gather up all the reference I can and that‚Äôs where the creative process starts: I sit back and I start narrowing down which shot I want to use of the main character and what background I want to use. It‚Äôs like a big puzzle. I have to have all my source materials sitting out there in front of me, and that‚Äôs where the design element starts‚Äîin my head, at least. It doesn‚Äôt make much sense for me to sketch something out knowing I‚Äôm never going to find the shot of this actor looking like this. It‚Äôs a painful road to go down, because the art directors and editors get their hearts set on that initial thumbnail and then you have to revise it and change it based on the material I actually have to work from. And you‚Äôll get, ‚ÄúHey, I wanted him in that pose,‚Äù and it‚Äôs like, but that one doesn‚Äôt exist! So then you have to figure out how to pose it and shoot it and model it. It‚Äôs a lot better when you already have source material. HB: Tell us about the illustrations you did for Harper‚Äôs Bazaar. What did your collaboration with the editors look like? BR: They came through and they went through some of the storybooks that I had done and picked out some of their favorite iconic scenes from the Star Wars films, with backgrounds everybody felt familiar with that you‚Äôve seen a million times, and they had a list of the models in those scenes that they wanted with the outfits they wanted. You know, kind of replace Luke with Kendall Jenner. So that‚Äôs kind of how that evolved.   HB: In all the aspects of the brand that you‚Äôve worked on, where do you get to have the most fun? BR: Doing the storybooks is really fun because we‚Äôre reinventing some classic scenes from the film that everybody knows, and oftentimes we‚Äôll kind of pitch it from a different angle. We‚Äôll paint it up in a way by using multiple sets of references and source material, so even though it‚Äôs a familiar scene and you feel like you‚Äôve seen it before, it‚Äôs something new for the fans to get a kick out of: ‚ÄúOh, we didn‚Äôt see it from that camera angle!‚Äù HB: So are you trying to tell us that Han shot first? BR: I ain‚Äôt going nowhere near that. Gotta leave a mystery in there somewhere‚ÄîI‚Äôm not gonna be the guy that said any of that! HB: It was worth a shot. BR: Honestly, the funnest thing about Star Wars from an illustrator‚Äôs standpoint is that you get to dabble in a lot of different cultures with the Star Wars films. If I‚Äôm doing a fine art painting, I can almost do a Wild West painting, or I can do a very hard sci-fi tech-y painting, or I can make it more fantastical. I mean, that‚Äôs the beauty of the Star Wars films to me: they touch on so many levels and subject matters, and it‚Äôs cool creatively to spread your wings a little bit in so many different genres all inside of one film franchise.  Special thanks to Samira Ibrahim, Michael Siglain, and the brilliant minds at Lucasfilm and Disney. Star Wars: The Last Jedi opens in U.S. theaters on December 15.

 "I love pasta and being greased up in olive oil..." Day 3 of LOVE's advent calendar is every bit as brilliant as Day 2's Ashley Graham video. In the latest instalment, Emily Ratajkowski takes the opportunity to writhe around in spaghetti, getting up close and personal with her carbs. Wearing just her underwear, and a pair of wool mittens, she makes a pretty big mess while attempting to "eat spaghetti gracefully," but most viewers will agree that it was definitely worth attempting.  The video ends with a quote from Ratajkowski saying, "I love pasta and being greased up in olive oil more than life itself." Watch the full video now:

 The countdown to the Victoria Secret Fashion Show is on. The countdown is on for the 2018 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show.

See what all the top models are wearing before they try on their wings for the first time! Hadid channels swinging '60s style in a sweater dress and knee-high boots.   The Angel isnt afraid to stand out in bold color.   The New Zealand beauty kept it classic in a black silk shirt and coordinating jeans, and a grey bag that pops.  The PINK Ambassador stays loyal to the rose hue.  The VS rookie is not shy about her style.  The Swedish top model went for sporty instead of sexy in a oversized windbreaker.  After missing out on the last two shows the Angel is ready to return to the runway.  Swanepoel looks ready to rock her 11th Victoria Secret Fashion Show.  Who's the cool girl on the block? This VS rookie is clearly looking to stand out with her person style.  The VS rookie keeps it sexy in a lingerie-inspired bodysuit and leopard skirt for her first fitting.

 The model and her toddler walked Jean Paul Gaultier's Spring 2018 Couture show.  Paris Couture Week has had plenty of attention-making moments so far‚Äîfrom Bella Hadid opening and closing the Alexandre Vauthier show to Kaia Gerber making her debut at Chanel Couture to Ulyana Sergeenko and Miroslava Duma's racial controversy yesterday. But today's Jean Paul Gaultier show brought forth the sweetest moment of the week thus far.  Coco Rocha and her 2-year-old daughter, Ioni James Conran, walked the runway in matching looks at Jean Paul Gaultier's Spring 2018 couture show. Walking hand-in-hand, the mommy-and-me duo closed the show wearing icy blue one-shouldered gowns adorned with black hearts, black opera gloves, white tights, and spiral ponytails.  Just when you thought the runway moment couldn't get any cuter, the mom and daughter made sure to strike a few dramatic fashun poses while exiting the runway.  At just two years old, little Ioni is already proving to be a pro on the catwalk‚Äîand how many toddlers can say they've walked a Paris couture show? I'm pretty sure at the age of 2 the only place I walked was the playground in off-the-rack OshKosh B'Gosh (the horror). Of course, Ioni has been advanced from the start and already has her own Instagram page with over 60,000 followers. Her mom took to the account to share some behind-the-scenes snaps of the fitting and rehearsal for the tot's first couture show:   Fitting and rehearsal at @jpgaultierofficial - my first ever couture fashion show!!

 The model channeled the late royal's timeless style (bike shorts included).  Long before Kardashians and influencers were wearing bike shorts, Princess Diana made them cool. The late royal knew how to work everything from a skirt suit to a revenge dress, but the way she finessed '90s athleisure and casual attire made her the relatable fashion icon we still honor to this day.  It models from Gigi Hadid to Emily Ratajkowski have put their spin on the figure-hugging short in the past year, but Hailey Bieber paid the ultimate sartorial tribute to Princess Di, who passed away in 1997, in a new editorial for Vogue Paris. In the shoot, photographed by Gregory Harris and styled by Virginie Benarroch, the 22-year-old channels the royal's casual elegance in oversized college sweatshirts, chunky tube socks, and baseball caps.   new story for @vogueparis shot by @gstyles styled by @virginiebenarroch üíï all credit and inspo to the amazingly beautiful and iconically stylish Princess Diana who I‚Äôve looked to for style inspiration for as long as I can remember.

 Friends who model in Aruba together, stay together.  Georgia Gibbs and Kate Wasley are best friends and models who are perhaps best known for their March Instagram post, which went viral because, you know, they just happen to have different body-types (which is a completely normal, common thing because no one has the same exact body-type?) As Georgia explains in the caption above, among the response to their initial photo were comments from people who believed she'd photoshopped the photo to flatter herself  (in comparison to her friend Kate). This, Georgia says, "broke [her] heart," but also led her and Kate to found "Any BODY," a joint Instagram account and website that promotes body positivity for women of ~all sizes~ because, yes please. The duo's Insta accounts quickly grew a large following, and received an overwhelmingly positive response. "Can't tell you how heartwarming it is seeing so many of you embrace your bodies," they wrote on their Instagram. The pair even found themselves on the cover of Australia's Health & Fitness magazine in September.  But perhaps the most exciting moment of their modeling careers came Wednesday, when Sports Illustrated officially announced Georgia and Kate as the magazine's latest 2018 SI Swim Rookies. They both took part in a magical photoshoot in Aruba and truly the photos speak for themselves.  Kate and Georgia lead by example in overcoming negativity (whether it's internal or external) to embrace yourself and support others around you‚Äîbecause we are all different and should love what makes us that way. And hey, just throwing it out there, if any of my friends casually want to fly to Aruba with me to recreate these gorgeous photos, HMU.

 The designer is said to be stepping down after 10 years with the fashion house. Phoebe Philo is reportedly exiting C√©line after 10 years with the French brand, according to WWD. The Spring 2018 collection, debuting in March, will be her last, a source with with knowledge of the matter told the site.  Philo will also not work for another designer "in the near future" and her successor is expected to be announced "in the coming months." In the meantime, the C√©line team will design collections and adhere to "the craftsmanship the house is renowned for," the source added. The brand has not yet publicly confirmed her departure. WWD obtained a statement Philo sent to her team, which included a grateful parting message.  "Working with CeÃÅline has been an exceptional experience for me these last 10 years," it reads. "I am grateful to have worked with an incredibly talented and committed team and I would like to thank everyone along the way who has been part of the collaborations and conversations‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs been amazing." LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault praised the designer "for having contributed to the great momentum of this Maison" and added that "a new era of development for CeÃÅline will now start," according to WWD. Philo's exit has been rumored for months now. In October, Business of Fashion reported that the designer was parting ways with the brand and that "interviews have been going on for a few months" to find a replacement. However, at the time, LVMH "categorically [denied] any imminent departure of Phoebe Philo from C√©line." Philo joined C√©line in 2008, after a successful tenure at Chlo√© as creative director, which she inherited from Karl Lagerfeld in 1997, BoF reports. She most recently showed her Spring 2018 collection at Paris Fashion Week in early October, featuring a "playful" but "elevated" range of suits, capes, printed dresses, and more. 
 Tracking the 5-year-old's best style moments.  At just five years old, North West is already a fashion force to be reckoned with. We're tracking the style-icon in-the-making's best fashion moments‚Äîfrom her Fashion Week debut to her post-ballet class attire. There's no shame in taking sartorial inspiration from a child when she dresses in Alexander Wang, Balmain, and Yeezy, after all. Attending Kanye West's Sunday Service at Coachella with Ryan Romulus. North's outfit is reminiscent of mom Kim Kardashian's pared back, taupe-toned outfits. In yet another A+ street style look during her New York trip, North stepped out in a two-piece python print set and her signature Vans sneakers.  Shop It: Vans Kids Authentic sneakers, $35, vans.com.

Shop It: Vans Kids Authentic sneakers, $35, vans.com. SHOP NOW Making her runway debut, North strutted down the runway at the L.O.L Surprise! Fashion Show, while her mom Kim Kardashian West proudly watched from the front row. The 5-year-old rocked a red patent leather skirt and motorcycle jacket, black Cult Gaia bamboo clutch, and oversized sunglasses.  In a hot pink adidas outfit, Yeezy sneakers, and a candy necklace choker (which, yum) just ahead of her 5th birthday in New York.  Oh, this old thing? Just a casual ice skating look, nothing to see here. North wore a black shaggy fur coat, a little black dress with a pearlized collar, and high socks for an ice skating session at Central Park‚Äîinspiring us all to step up our style game next time we hit the rink.   North mastered the art of dressing like a New Yorker while en route to dinner at Serendipity 3 on Saturday night. The tot wore a shaggy black fur coat, black dress with safety pin detailing, and Dr Martens boots.  The four-year-old touched down in New York for a trip with Kourtney Kardashian and cousin Penelope Disick wearing a black bomber jacket, Van's sneakers, and accessorizing with a teddy bear, as you do.  Channeling her sportier side, North stepped our in a red Adidas jersey dress, white socks, black Vans, and of course, blue Fun Dip while out at GlowZone in LA.  While out with Kim Kardashian and brother Saint West, North wore a pink The Kid's Supply dress and gray Adidas sneakers.  In a Cypress Hill t-shirt that she turned into a tank dress (according to Kim Kardashian's Snapchat) and The Kid's Supply x AKID fur slides while painting at Color Me Mine.  Schooling us all on the art of being cool in a Snoop Dogg tank dress, rhinestone choker and leopard fur slides for her 4th birthday dinner at Ruby's Diner.  In a pink patterned slip dress and a black tee with her signature Vans at the Museum of Ice Cream. The 3-year-old stepped out in a pink velvet lace-up dress, a bejeweled bag and sneakers with her parents names' airbrushed onto the backs (which is probably only cool if your parents are Kim and Kanye).  While at a birthday party over the weekend, North stepped out in a green "Calabasas" thermal outfit, another possible sneak-peek at Kim and Kanye's upcoming childrenswear line with Adidas. Naturally, the 3-year-old has us hoping it comes in adult sizes too.  Kourtney Kardashian took to Instagram to share North's festive Valentine's Day outfit‚Äîa heart slip dress, Vans and a leather jacket with dad Kanye West's "Famous" lyrics on the back. Nailed it.  In a black fur jacket, velvet turtleneck dress, tights, Doc Martens and a lollipop, of course.  For a night at the New York City Ballet, North debuts the first designs from Kim and Kanye's upcoming kids' clothing line (which she helped design, of course). She topped off the bright look with tube socks and Vans.  While in Costa Rica, the 3-year-old sticks to her no-fail uniform: a velvet slipdress and Vans. She has, it seems, officially retired and moved on from the black choker trend too.  For a family day out in Costa Rica, North wears a lace camisole and shorts set and flip flops. (One time I saw North West wearing lace shorts and flip flops so I bought lace shorts and flip flops.) via @bound2west Boarding a private plane to Costa Rica with the Kardashian family, North wears a pink hoodie personalized with her nickname, "Nori."  via @NoriWestSource  While out in Miami, North embraced the furry slides trend, styling a black pair by AKID with a velvet slip dress, t-shirt and dad hat‚Äîlooking insanely cooler than any of us ever will.  North went full '90s (again) in a red velvet slipdress layered over a black graphic tee, plus a skinny choker necklace and black baby Yeezys.  North's sporty-chic style game is going strong. The three-year-old stepped out in a Supreme t-shirt and not-yet-available Yeezy Boost sneakers.  If anyone can bring back the monogram Louis Vuitton Speedy bag, it's 3-year-old North West. The tot was spotted in New York carrying a mini version of the bag and wearing one of her signature slip dresses with a pair of white sneakers. Take note, street style stars.  North West dons an outfit her mom and aunts are fond of‚Äîan oversized Yeezy sweatshirt worn as a dress plus Yeezy sneakers.  For a night out at Kanye West's Madison Square Garden concert, Kim Kardashian and North West stepped out in matching silver sequin Vetements dresses. While Kim topped hers off with a pair of Yeezy heels, North went for a more laid-back look in a pair of Vans. Ugh, don't you hate it when your mom steals your outfit?  While out with mom Kim Kardashian in New York City, North gave every '90s style lover envy in this velvet slip dress, choker and Vans sneakers.  While in New York, North stepped out in a leopard slip dress, black choker and Yeezy Boosts‚Äîreminding us all she still dresses better than most adults.

 The shoe designer and swimwear maven are putting a modern spin on vintage Hollywood pin-up silhouettes. The arrival of June marks the unofficial kick-start of summer, and the weather is already heating up. In anticipation of the scorchers to come, we're ready to kick it poolside, beachfront, and sprawled out on a chaise lounge‚Äîafter a little swimwear wardrobe refresh. In a market saturated with solid-colored skimpy string bikinis, it can be heard to find a suit that fits, flatters, and covers, plus comes in a fun summery print. Luckily, luxury footwear and accessories brand Charlotte Olympia has just teamed up with Brazilian beachwear designer Adriana Degreas, to launch a Old Hollywood glam meets modern playful swimwear capsule collection that screams fun in the sun. To celebrate its 10-year anniversary, Charlotte Olympia is bringing their signature kitten-adorned pin-up accessories aesthetic into the summer season. In a strategic retail play, uniting with Adriana Degreas' internationally coveted luxury swimwear label, the limited-edition collection fuses both designers' trademark styles.  Featuring retro high-waisted bottoms with flattering ruched side panels, plus sexy strapless and structured bustier tops, the suits are an ode to the classic 1950s vintage silhouettes. Available in both bikini and one-piece varieties, the suits come in cute eclectic prints, including stand-out leopard and tutti frutti appliqu√©s, plus timeless solid options of fire engine red and blush pink. In addition to swimwear, the collection also includes pool slides, vintage bathing caps, and airy coverups. The exclusive collection of Charlotte Olympia by Adriana Degreas swimwear will be available for purchase in mid-June at Bergdorf Goodman and other worldwide retailers as well as online at the Adriana Degreas site.

 The brand has racked up critical acclaim and celebrity fans.  Meghan Markle made her post-baby debut today with her husband and newborn son in tow. Naturally, after everyone ooh'd and aah'd over the royal baby, attention quickly turned to Markle's choice of dress for the official portraits. The Duchess chose a clean, perfectly tailored white trench-inspired dress by one of London's coolest up-and-coming designers, Wales Bonner. Wales Bonner first launched in 2014 by Central Saint Martin grad Grace Wales Bonner as a menswear line focused on clean tailoring and presenting a specific notion of luxury through the lens of European and Afro-Atlantic approaches. Wales Bonner is inspired by her exploration of critical theory, music composition, literature and history. It wasn't long before Wales Bonner garnered fans like Jaden Smith and Luka Sabbat and began to rack up accolades for her design work.  In 2015, Wales Bonner was awarded Emerging Menswear Designer at the British Fashion Awards. The following year, after her runway debut at London Fashion Week, she was also acknowledged by LVMH with their 2016 Young Designer Prize. By 2018, Wales Bonner launched womenswear.  Just this week Wales Bonner was announced as a 2019 finalist of the British Fashion Council's Designer Fund where she will be given 100,000 GBP for her company.  She also just collaborated with Dior's Maria Grazia Chiuri on a look for the french house's Resort 2020 collection. The designer was invited by Dior to help reimagine the "New Look" silhouette for the Marrakech show that was inspired by African culture. To top off a very busy month, Wales Bonner also teamed up with  Solange and several other musical artists on a devotional and meditative experience at St. Peter's Lutheran Church in New York City during Frieze Art Fair. 
 Yes, she walked last month's VS fashion show while expecting. Forget Victoria's secret, Candice Swanepoel had a secret of her own she's been keeping these last few months. The supermodel revealed on Instagram Friday night that she is pregnant with her second child. "Christmas came early," she captioned her post. Yes, that means she walked the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show in Shanghai last month while pregnant. But Swanepoel certainly had everyone fooled, as her fans praised her fit post-baby figure.  The VS Angel welcomed her first child, a son named Anaca in October of 2016, with her fiance, model Hermann Nicoli.  Swanepoel is not the first Angel to hit the Victoria's Secret runway with child‚Äîlast year Irina Shayk famously debuted her bump at the show in Paris. Alessandra Ambrosio also walked the lingerie extravaganza while pregnant in years past. The South African beauty skipped last year's show in Paris which took place just a month after the birth of her son.  This year was Swanepoel's 10th anniversary show, and she made quite the comeback, opening the Shanghai show.  Aside from walking the runway in her underwear, the Angel was not shy about bearing her midriff prior to her baby announcement.  For the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show official viewing party in New York on November 28th the blonde bombshell rocked a see-through, with a bra and matching jacket showing off her abs. She sure fooled us.

 From the grand show venue to Kaia Gerber hitting the runway.  For its latest Metiers d'Art show, Chanel unveiled its Pre-Fall 2018 collection in Hamburg, Germany today. From the stunning venue to the top models and star studded front row, here's everything to know from the fashion house's latest show.  Taking place at Hamburg's newly-opened Elbphilharmonie concert hall, the Metiers d'Art show transformed a grand orchestra theater into its runway. The building, designed by Herzog & de Meuron, is one of the German city's largest structures. This also marks the first time Karl Lagerfeld has ever staged a fashion show in his hometown.  Karl Lagerfeld's A-list muses‚Äîincluding Kristen Stewart, Lily-Rose Depp, and Tilda Swinton‚Äîwere all in attendance for the occasion, watching on from the front row in Chanel looks.  Runway breakout star Kaia Gerber walked her second ever Chanel show, sporting two Pre-Fall looks on the runway. Anna Ewers, Soo Joo Park, Grace Elizabeth and more also hit the catwalk. Inspired by German culture of the 1960s, Chanel's Pre-Fall 2018 collection included a lineup full of mini skirts paired with black opaque tights. Each of the mod-inspired looks was topped off with a newsboy cap, some of which were adorned with a black lace veil. Chanel's signature tweed suits, dresses, and skirts were also included in the collection, as well as an array of cozy knitwear pieces.  Taking his final bow, Karl Lagerfeld walked the runway with his mini muse, nine-year-old Hudson Kroenig. The boy wore the chicest black double-breasted suit along with one of the newsboy caps worn on the catwalk.  
 
 Some of these winners are no-brainers.  Kendall Jenner is the biggest model on Instagram, the app's end-of-year data proves. Among her fellow models, the 22-year-old has the most followers, the most mentions, the most-liked photo and the most followers gained in 2017. Other It Girls like Gigi and Bella Hadid, Emily Ratajkowski, Hailey Baldwin, Ashley Graham and some Victoria's Secret Angels follow closely behind on the lists. However, the most-engaged category‚Äîwhich factors in the amount of likes and comments in relation to the user's number of followers‚Äîis where up-and-comers shine. Julia Ratner (34k followers) and Mayowa Nicholas (49k) top the list, even though their follower count is much lower than Jenner's or Hadid's millions. The data was based off of findings from January 1, 2017 through November 17, 2017, according to Instagram. Overall, the biggest users on the app come as no surprise, as Selena Gomez retains her top spot as the most-followed user (with a whopping 130 million followers) and Beyonc√©'s pregnancy photoshoot takes the crown as the most-liked photo of the year (and ever) with 11 million likes and counting.  As far as the fashion world goes, the biggest designers on Instagram were also no-brainers, as household names like Chanel and Dior and celebrities like Victoria Beckham came out on top.

 The must-have pieces of the season. Gird your loins and pockets, warm weather lovers. Summer is just around the corner, and we're preparing our wardrobes by stashing away heavy leather and chunky knitwear in order to usher in the stylish season ahead. With an abundance of trends emerging from both the runways as well as your ever-shifting social media feeds, how are you to know what's worth skipping and what's worth coveting? We've got you covered.  From the 90s-inspired strappy sandal to beach-ready seashell adorned accessories, these are the 5 style essentials to know and covet for Summer 2019.  Consider this sandal the shoe equivalent of the silky slip dress for its functionality and versatility. We've seen a major resurgence of the late '90s and early 2000's inspired dressing, and this footwear trend has quickly become a favorite. The ultimate everyday sandal, wear it at the office or at happy hour. Raye's simple and sleek iteration makes this white mid-height heel an easy go-to, and the price tag makes it even easier. They come in black, coral, lime and snakeskin, too.¬† While smocking isn't necessarily new, this season designers and brands are committing to feminine scrunchie details in the daintiest, dreamiest silhouettes. From eye-catching pleats to girly floral prints, there's nothing that screams summer more than these sundresses. For both a flattering silhouette and a flirty length.¬† Maxi is in ‚Äî and this¬†cotton-voile option can be worn with both chunky sneakers or barely-there sandals. Thanks to Proenza Schouler and Stella McCartney, this summer is hyper-focused on the modernization of the tie-dye print. It's circulating for all of its unapologetically bold glory and no longer only exists in your pre-teen summer camp memory bank. Update your casual classic white t-shirt for an unexpected twist; nostalgia included. With a satisfying mix of burnt orange and sunset hues, your white slouchy trousers will receive the refresh you‚Äôve been yearning for. Add a little bit of wistfulness to your Summer 2019 wardrobe with a resort-ready piece. They're not only exclusive to necklaces anymore; new designs have cropped up as ring embellishments, dangling earrings and hair accessories. Dinosaur Designs‚Äô artsy take on the trend is a more realistic, sophisticated option. Lightweight, mismatched, and contemporary in design? These statement dangles are all you‚Äôll need to elevate your look. If there's one surprising reemergence we're looking forward to styling, it's the Bermuda short. Besides their obvious comfort factor, these long, slimming shorts come in a variety of options; from utilitarian to denim. This summer, try the trend with a statement-making peasant blouse or a lightweight blazer. An easy-to-style, every day Bermuda short with a vintage feel. The ways in which these can be worn are endless. Deitas' elevated take on the look makes for a sophisticated pairing with all your knitted tank-tops and easy slide-on mules.
 We need to be resuscitated please.  Valentino's Spring 2019 haute couture show just ended with a pleasant surprise: a closing walk by Naomi Campbell. The runway legend made an unexpected appearance on the catwalk in Paris, emerging in a Pierpaolo Piccioli-designed sheer black gown with voluminous sleeves and a tiered ruffle skirt.  The crowd applauded her cameo (including Celine Dion, who sat awestruck in the front row) and fans continued to send praise on Twitter.  The one and only Naomi Campbell closed the Valentino Couture show. Over 30 years later and still dominating the runway. pic.twitter.com/EM0QezAOkE Naomi! ‚Å¶@MaisonValentino‚Å© #Couture pic.twitter.com/isULBKjaoU Naomi Campbell closing Valentino Couture. That's all. That's the tweet. pic.twitter.com/63N2GhwMgF Naomi Campbell is THAT bitch üî• https://t.co/o4GAw3Nqgj Along with this appearance of a treasured supermodel, Valentino delivered dramatic silhouettes, bold colors, and whimsical florals with its couture show today. As looks like Naomi's showed, frills and ruffles were definitely not off-limits.   This marked the latest of dreamy presentations in Paris this couture week, following giant bows at Givenchy, a real-life acrobat circus at Dior, and a Mediterranean villa at Chanel, complete with a swimming pool and bathing suit-clad bride.   @NaomiCampbell closes @MaisonValentino #HauteCouture in Paris. pic.twitter.com/GgVz6UtDiu  Campbell has been making her rounds at the Paris shows in the past few days as a viewer for Men's Fashion Week. She was recently spotted at an Azzedine Ala√Øa tribute event, as well as in the front rows for Dior and Louis Vuitton's menswear shows.  Campbell's runway appearances have been selective as of late. One of her latest catwalk cameos was in New York last October, for the launch of the Moschino x H&M collection. Months earlier, she also walked for Miu Miu's Cruise 2019 show and Dolce & Gabbana's Alta Moda show in July.  With Fall 2019 fashion month right around the corner, we've got our fingers crossed for another one of Naomi's surprise runway moments. 
 Celebrities from all over the world pay tribute to the late designer. Paris paid tribute to legendary designer Karl Lagerfeld with a memorial event in his honor, held at the Grand Palais on June 20, 2019. Lagerfeld passed away in February 2019 at the age of 85. The prolific designer made an unforgettable impact on the fashion world thanks to his tenures at Chanel and Fendi. The celebrated designer also founded his own successful label, and his influence is sure to continue for years to come. Models including Cara Delevinge, Gigi Hadid, and Claudia Schiffer attended "Karl For Ever" in Paris, along with actors and actresses, lauded fashion designers, musicians, dancers, celebrities, and media tycoons. Here, some of the most important moments from the event:
 The "dad" sneaker is officially taking over.  Athleisure has been trending for the last few years, but the style sets obsession with the appearance of athleticism has reached a new height with the "dad" sneaker. While we don't believe these will do much for your form, the trend has hit fever pitch with all the major houses from Chanel to Louis Vuitton debuting their own, and it's trickled down to some of our favorite athletic brands like Fila who have revived their Disruptor sneaks that have been around for decades.

 The fashion label stands in solidarity and support of Americans working together to end gun violence. Standing alongside the likes of Gucci's Alessandro Michele, Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez, the creative duo behind Proenza Schouler, are making it their mission to fight for gun control, by way of fashion. The New York-born brand has just announced the launch of two new politically-minded graphic tees, as additions to the existing PSWL (Proenza Schouler White Label), in an effort to raise awareness and support for gun violence prevention. Available in black short-sleeved and white long-sleeved varieties, the logo design affixed both shirts depicts an image of a gun stamped with a bold red cross. More than just a wearable statement, the label seeks to give more to the gun-control cause, pledging to donate 100 percent of the PSWL Benefitting Everytown t-shirt proceeds to Everytown, a movement of Americans working together to end gun violence and build safer communities. Citing the brand's American establishment, the team behind Proenza says they feel a sense of responsibility to use the platform to speak out for the prevention of future gun-related crimes in the United States.  "As an American company, we believe that every person, young and old, has the right to feel safe at all times," the label released in a statement today. "There have been too many lives lost and voices silenced due to gun violence in the U.S. We have chosen to speak up and have been inspired by Everytown's mission to mobilize for policy change across communities. It is with this intent that we use our platform to support the intersectional principles that we believe in." Available for purchase online or in-store at Proenza Schouler's 121 Greene Street New York City location, the T-shirts will be sold for $90 each, with all proceeds donated directly to Everytown and the continued fight for gun-control in the United States. 
 Jeremy Scott took a stand at the end of his Spring 2019 show.  The fashion industry may have its eyes on the Spring 2019 runways at New York Fashion Week, but let's not forget something a little bigger than what we'll be wearing next season is currently unfolding in Washington, D.C.: the Kavanaugh hearings.  As the Senate holds confirmation hearings for Judge Brett Kavanaugh, President Trump's Supreme Court justice nominee, Americans across the country have been protesting his appointment. From the timing of his nomination in the midst of the Mueller investigation to his dangerous stance on Roe v. Wade, Kavanaugh's hearings have been incredibly controversial. And now the protests have made their way to New York Fashion Week, with Jeremy Scott making a statement on Day 1 of the shows. At the end of his show, the designer took a bow wearing a white t-shirt reading, "Tell Your Senator NO On Kavanaugh."  The shirt also provided a phone number, 202-902-7129, for showgoers (and viewers at home) to exercise their civic duty and call their local Senator.  Scott's t-shirt wasn't the only statement-making piece in his Spring 2019 collection. Jackets and sweaters covered in neon words like, "RESIST," "PEACE," "REVOLT," and "HOPE" were worn by both male and female models on the runway. The fashion industry is no stranger to making political statements on the runway. From protecting the ACLU to Planned Parenthood and immigration policy, the last few seasons especially have seen many American (and even European) designers utilizing their shows for statements of protest and activism.  Given that it's still early in the New York Fashion Week schedule, this is likely just the beginning of runway political statements to come. 
 From Lauren Conrad, to Kate Hudson, to Aja Naomi King. The 8th Annual Veuve Clicquot Polo Classic took place at Will Rogers State Historic Park on October 14, 2017 in Pacific Palisades, California. From Aja Naomi King to Lauren Conrad, stars turned out in a stunning array of dresses, jumpsuits, and hats for the event. In Johanna Ortiz, with the Clare V. Petite Alice bag. In the Shoshanna Midnight Najlah Dress.
 Happy x Nature is seriously stylish and eco-friendly. If you're like us, and you find the constant statistics of global warming rather alarming, you may know that the fashion industry, as much as we love it, is one of the biggest polluters of the environment. Fast fashion just happens to be one of the top offenders, but how else do you look good and on trend on a tight budget? Well, Kate Hudson might just have the answer for you. Today, the A-list Hollywood actress and mother of three is launching her own ready-to-wear line called Happy x Nature (spoken as Happy By Nature) that just happens to be stylish and sustainable. Why would Hudson add a clothing line to her already full plate? The actress balances her Hollywood career with three kids (she gave birth to daughter Rani back in September) and her athletic line Fabletics. "I've always wanted to do this," Hudson told BAZAAR.com when we stopped by for a sneak preview of the collection. "I started working on this a year ago, I wanted to do it for a real long time. When you have people who really want you to endorse their brands, at some point you realize you just want to do it for yourself. Something that feels really authentic to you." At first look it's easy to see this collection is very Kate Hudson. Clearly, California inspired with countless printed sundresses made of recycled cotton, knit sets made for Coachella, prairie blouses, and boot-cut denim that she insisted on having, even if her head designer was a little apprehensive at first. The HappyxNature denim is made with Repreve, a leading recycled fiber made from plastic bottle, and cost just under $100. The rest of the line ranges from $48 to $148 Hudson admits that building a sustainable brand is really challenging. "We tried to keep the carbon footprint as low as possible," she says, even when it comes down to the clothing tag made of natural fibers. She hopes to increase the company's sustainability as time goes on. "I just hope this becomes so successful that every brand starts rethinking the way they do things. It feels like a responsibility in fashion now." Clearly Hudson is ready to lead the charge.

 The designer, formerly of Saint Laurent, takes over February 1 After stunning the fashion world with news of Phoebe Philo's departure, C√©line announced today that her replacement is Hedi Slimane. The former Saint Laurent creative director is taking the reigns beginning February 1 with the title artistic, creative and image director, with some addendums. According to BoF, Slimane will "expand the LVMH-owned label‚Äôs offering into menswear, couture and fragrance." His first show will be for Spring 2019 in Paris in September. ‚ÄúI am particularly happy that Hedi is back within the LVMH Group and taking the reins of our C√©line maison,‚Äù LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault remarked in a press statement, ‚ÄúHe is one of the most talented designers of our time. I have been a great admirer of his work since we collaborated on Dior Homme, which he launched to global critical acclaim in the 2000s. His arrival at C√©line reinforces the great ambitions that LVMH has for this maison.‚Äù  Slimane helmed Dior Homme from 2000-2007 to great critical and financial success before launching his own men's and women's wear labels, while pursuing photography work. In 2012, Slimane took on the high profile position as creative director of YSL. While there he changed the brand's name to Saint Laurent, lent a sometimes critically divisive rocker-chic aesthetic to the brand and  more than doubled annual sales revenue to $787 million dollars in his first three years.  In March 2016, Slimane announced he was leaving Saint Laurent after his short tenure, with reports of issues with Fran√ßois Henri Pinault, chairman of the parent company of Yves Saint Laurent, Kering. He is now reunited with LVMH's Sidney Toledano in his new role. One thing is for sure, Slimane has some big, impressive, while-loved, furry shoes to fill at Philo's C√©line.

 Super meets super in Stuart Weitzman's latest campaign.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. Stuart Weitzman has a penchant for casting legendary supermodels in its campaigns. For the past five years, the shoe brand's ads have been fronted by the likes of Kate Moss, Gisele B√ºndchen, Natalia Vodianova, and Gigi Hadid‚Äîto name a few. For Spring 2018, however, the brand opted for a multi-generational mash-up of supermodels starring none other than Kate Moss and Gigi Hadid. The ads mark the first time the pair has ever modeled together. Shot by Mario Testino, Kate and Gigi appear arm-in-arm (and leg-in-leg) in two black and white photos, showcasing several of Stuart Weitzman's spring styles including the Iris mule and Fringe Dust crystal-embellished heels.   A second ad features the supermodel duo in black moto boots posing on top of male model Jordan Barrett, as you do.    Stuart Weitzman moto boots, $655, SHOP Gigi Hadid took to Instagram to share some behind-the-scenes photos along with her experience shooting alongside one of her modeling heroes, Kate the Great.  "I had the great honor and pleasure of shooting the new @stuartweitzman campaign with the one and only Kate. @katemossagency, I had the greatest time with you, and am forever touched by your spirit and presence," Hadid wrote.  In a behind-the-scenes video titled "Supermodel Sound Off," both models were interviewed on set about their hidden talents, Google habits, guilty pleasures, and more. Watch the full video below:  Spring 2018 is shaping up to be a season of supermodel-filled moments. Versace's spring runway show in Milan first staged a reunion of '90s supermodels including Naomi Campbell, Cindy Crawford, Claudia Schiffer, Helena Christensen, and Carla Bruni honoring the late Gianni Versace 20 years after his death. The fashion house then followed the spectacle with a Spring 2018 campaign featuring Christy Turlington, Naomi Campbell, Kaia Gerber, Gisele Bundchen, Gigi Hadid, and more. 
 Ethical, sustainable fashion have become buzz words, but these designers go above and beyond... There are no hard and fast rules about calling a fashion brand "sustainable" or "ethical." The simple fact is every brand should be creating clothing with as little waste and environmental impact as possible. We've all heard the stats, "The world uses 1.3 trillion gallons of water each year for fabric dyeing alone, enough to fill 2 million Olympic-sized swimming pools"; "The average consumer bought 60% more clothing in 2015 than 2000, but kept each garment half as long"; "The average American now generates 82 pounds of textile waste each year. That adds up to more than 11 million tons of textile waste from the U.S. alone." This all adds up to a double faced issue: the first is that manufacturing clothing is like a bitch slap to Mother Earth and the second is that an entire generation of consumers views clothing as a transient purchase, to be worn limited times‚Äîor not at all‚Äîand thoughtlessly discarded.  The trick then lies in either not buying clothing, buying only used or vintage clothing, or being incredibly choosy about the clothing we do buy. If we choose the latter (and if you're a reader of this site, let's be honest, you'll probably shop again) it's about making sure that what we buy is coming from brands that limit their use of natural resources and overall impact on the environment. Perhaps even more important than that, though,  is actually loving the few pieces we put our dollars behind so much that we plan on holding on to them for years to come‚Äîperhaps long enough to pass them along to a next generation. Here are four brands that hit the mark in four very different ways.  Founded in 2014 by designers Nicole Heim and Chelsea Healy, this New York-based brand makes ultra-special pieces locally and builds seasonally on a foundation of basics. Their latest collection for Fall is equal parts chic caftans, flirty animal-print dresses, and lavender suede trousers that somehow feel like closet basics‚Äîbut so much more. Gigi Hadid, Gwyneth Paltrow, Emma Watson, and Naomi Watts are fans. Cienne was recently named the runner-up in the 2018 CFDA + Lexus Fashion* Initiative, and is a semi-finalist in the 2018/19 International Woolmark Prize.   What are the key differences in how you work versus a traditional fashion brand? Chelsea Healy: I think one key difference is the idea of purpose. We try to be purposeful in everything we do, from designing to producing to interaction with customers. This is something we felt passionate about from the very start and how we operate on a daily basis. We also hope that this comes through in our creative output. How did your prior work in the industry lead you to creating Cienne? Nicole Heim: After years of working as a designer for a large fashion brand, and spending a lot of time in overseas factories, I became intimately aware of what mass consumption looks like. Everything is digested in large amounts and at such a fast pace, and that comes at a cost. It personally started to really affect me‚Äîboth as a consumer and as a designer. I began seeking out quality, creativity, and meaning in both my work and my life. I decided to quit my job and take a sabbatical in East Africa. It was a really transformational journey, and that work is what laid the foundation for Cienne. Thinking about how, why, and what we make is really important to me, and we set out to build that ideology in Cienne. I also felt the sustainable fashion available in the market had a specific aesthetic and messaging, I was really passionate about creatively reframing that. CH: When Cienne was coming to fruition, I had already been working in the industry for 10 years with a major fashion brand. I was able to gain experience in many areas of the industry over that course of time; including textile design, styling, and concept-color-apparel design. I fortunately was able to travel overseas and work on factory floors, so I really got familiar with the process and how garments were made first hand. At a company like Cienne, you have to be 100% hands on in every area of the business- so my knowledge and prior experience was critical for this next chapter, and I‚Äôm not sure how I could have done without it.   What did you feel was missing in the fashion conversation; what did you want to do differently? CH: I personally didn‚Äôt think anything in the market looked very unique, or it was very trend driven and overpriced. I value high-quality pieces you can invest in and have as a part of your wardrobe for years. We wanted to create fashion that felt both interesting and necessary;  with the idea that you could build a foundation for your wardrobe that could be enhanced upon season after season.   What do you dislike about how people talk about eco/sustainable/responsible fashion? NH: Sustainability in fashion is still a very new thing, and we're all still learning. It's incredibly complex and still lacks simple definition, so it's going to take education and time for us as an industry to accurately address what sustainability means to fashion in a more mainstream way. With that being said, what I dislike about the responsible fashion conversation is that if you're a fashion brand that cares about people and planet and treating both fairly, you fall into this bucket of a 'sustainable‚Äô brand, and that can be the only thing people talk about. It's also a specific conversation that often involves the same words which lack definition and aspiration. I'm very much a purist when it comes to design and creativity. We put a great deal of effort and emotion into our creative process, and when we talk only about sustainability, it neglects the core of what we do‚Äîdesign. Fashion is about fantasy and emotion and discovery; I believe those things still need to be at the forefront of a brand, while values and vision and sustainability should be the foundation and a tool for how you do business. In my opinion, we will be successful when we can stop talking about sustainability as its own category or niche spot in the market, and instead come to expect it from the brands we buy from. How would you describe your aesthetic? CH: There are many words we use to describe Cienne‚Äôs aesthetic but my favorites are "Boldly subtle. Clean and feminine. Eclectic." NH: Our aesthetic is a mix of masculine and feminine, refined and playful, clean and bold. It's the juxtaposition and nuance of these traits that inspire us.    What do you think the future of fashion should look like? What is ‚Äúideal consumerism?‚Äù in your opinion? NH: Honestly, I'm not yet sure how we balance the concept of "ideal consumerism." I do think we must find new ways and models of operating. We have been in an age of excess and carelessness for so long that we have done irreparable damage. In my personal opinion, waste is my biggest concern, and the future of fashion must be about making and consuming only what we need, in addition to finding innovative ways to put what we've already made back into the system.  CH: I believe the future of fashion is going to be about breaking free of all the old codes. Right now, fashion is a machine! How much we produce, how often we produce‚Äîthese are areas that need innovation. I feel it needs to slow down to speed up; meaning, how can we do more with less? Striking that balance is the future. To me, ‚Äòideal consumerism‚Äô is about steering consumers to make investment purchases and see the value in paying more for a higher quality garment that they will get more use out of.  Marie Dewet launched MaisonCl√©o with her mom Cl√©o as a sort of French girl chic meets Supreme‚Äîon Instagram. Cl√©o is a seamstress and Marie hails from resale site Vestiaire Collective. The two only list items to go on sale once a week and the elder Dewet produces each of the 20-25 pieces herself‚Äîall made out of natural fabrications of silk, cotton, and linen leftovers sourced from Couture houses. It's an old-world approach that works that much better in the modern age of internet marketing‚Äîthanks to a multitude of blogger fans like Leandra Medine and celebs like Emily Ratajkowski. The sexy-but-cute and very French countryside vibe is perfectly in the fashion ethos right now‚Äîand special touches like a matching scrunchie for each look leave any idea that fast fashion is a good idea in its wake.  What are the key differences in how you work versus a traditional fashion brand? Marie Dewet: One of the main difference is we have no schedule to follow, we have no collection, no season, just creating the pieces that we want, when we want, depending on the fabrics we find. We don't produce any fabrics so it depends on what I can find next week or next month among the Couture Houses and fabric suppliers' leftovers. Also, all the pieces are handmade to order by my mother so there is no stock, so no loss. Thanks to that system my mother can tailor each piece according to the measurements of the client that you can send us by email after your order. It is also possible to ask for special demands like a higher neckline or longer or shorter sleeves. Why did you want to create Maison Cl√©o? Did working in the fashion industry affect your decision? Totally. I have worked in the fashion industry, so I have seen the processes of making clothing, how much it costs, how it is produced‚Äîand it really made me think. At the same time, a lot of "French" brands were bring created, but always made with synthetic fabrics and I hate that it's not pleasant to wear. I wanted to create something where the price breakdown would be detailed on each product page so people know what they buy. I also want to fight against the mass production and to show to everyone there is another way to consume. What did you feel was missing in the fashion conversation, what did you want to do differently? I see that people are really excited when they order something from our shop because they have to wait, that is someone we are not used to do today, and the waiting is very exciting. It feels like you are buying something unique, handmade just for you. I think everyone can wait one week or two to get something, especially when we are talking about a piece of clothing because we have other pieces to wear‚Äîso really there is no need to have it right away, right? What do you dislike about how people talk about eco/sustainable/responsible fashion? I don't think any of it is bad‚Äîthe conversation about sustainable fashion is too important for our future not to be having. Perhaps, some people think the pieces are too expensive because they are used to buying their clothes at big fashion brands. But it's not their fault because they don't know how much it costs to produce a piece, how much time is needed, how much it costs for one meter of fabric, what taxes we have to pay‚Äîso we have to explain it to them. There is no transparency given by other brands, so they can't know, we have to tell them for them to be able to react, understand, and think about changing their way of consumption. How would you describe your aesthetic? Authentic. We have nothing to hide and as we are very simple people and I think you can feel that in the way we talk to our lovely clients. I often share videos of my mother sewing or packing the orders for example. What do you think the future of fashion should look like? What is ‚Äúideal consumerism?‚Äù in your opinion? A very personalized act of purchase, like in the past when you had to go to the tailor to have new clothes. A piece made with your own measurements‚Äîbecause nobody has the same type of body‚Äîthat you receive at home, that's not mass produced in advance. I also like when items are produced locally, because they are from that country and because it's important to have people working working locally. I like buying from an Australian brand that makes their stuff in Australia, from Barcelona from a brand that is hand-making in Barcelona, or from a LA brand that is producing their label in LA...   Designers Anna Chiu and Valerie Santillo, named KAMPERETT as a melding of their mothers‚Äô maiden names. The two bring backgrounds in fashion‚ÄîAnna in childrenswear and knitwear after a stint studying pre-med and Valerie in lingerie with an innate talent for illustration and painter. The San Francisco-based pair who produce everything locally have become a go-to in the cool girl tech and art scenes in Northern Cali with plans to take over the world‚Äîincluding a recent foray into bridal.  What are the key differences in how you work versus a traditional fashion brand? Valerie Santillo: We are very hands-on and make everything in small batches at our local factory. We are able to walk over and monitor how our things are being made, and have a personal relationship with everyone who touches our clothes. Fashion has become so fast and all about the bottom line. We, of course, need to be a profitable business to exist, but we want to create something authentic and true to us, our values and aesthetic, and we are not willing to compromise on quality, labor wages, and selling out for the sake of making money. We still hand-paint pieces in each collection, a process that is slow and time consuming, but that creates one-of-a kind pieces with soul that customers really appreciate.  What did you feel was missing in the fashion conversation, what did you want to do differently? VS:  This question is always so hard to answer because we didn't set out with this as a goal in mind when we first created the line. I think all we wanted to do was convey a point of view, our collective voice, and have the opportunity to translate illustration or hand-painted aspect onto garments. I think we both just wanted to explore that creative aspect of ourselves. It wasn't like we set out to do something different from the fashion conversation, it was more of a personal endeavor.  What do you dislike about how people talk about eco/sustainable/responsible fashion? Anna Chiu: Often, it feels like a marketing tactic for some companies. It is how we conduct our business because we think it is our responsibility as humans and to the planet to manufacture ethically and as sustainably as possible. We operate this way because we think it is the right way, not because we want to hook people to buy our clothes.  How would you describe your aesthetic? VS: Effortless and sophisticated. I think the Kamperett woman is the one in the room that subtly stands out from everyone else without being showy, by exuding confidence in an understated way.  AC: Soulful, easy, chic, and sensual. What do you think the future of fashion should look like? What is ‚Äúideal consumerism?‚Äù in your opinion? AC: We think that people should buy what they want and what makes them feel good, but also know where it came from and be educated about how it was made. Ideal consumerism would be making educated purchases. Possibly spending a little more to buy clothes that will last and to support those who are making it in a fair and ethical way. As our grandmothers said, quality over quantity. I do think more and more people are starting to shop this way. VS: To buy and collect with purpose. Less is more. Treat your wardrobe as if it is a life collection, a living thing that grows over time and only adding pieces to it to it that have value.  Kowtow is like the OG of chic sustainable brands‚Äîit was launched in 2007 as a slow fashion label by Gosia Piatek. Kowtow takes sustainable production very seriously, beginning with fairtrade farmers in India growing non-Monsanto cotton seeds. "Farmers use companion planting, crop rotation, and on-site green waste composting. From there the 16-month-long process of seed to garment begins. Every small detail from the coloring, the design, and even the buttons (made without nickel) are all accounted for," according to the brand bio. The vibe is minimal with a punch and the perfect hint of pretty and Piatek does not shy from color. Kowtow currently has a store in New Zealand with plans to expand. What are the key differences in how you work versus a traditional fashion brand? Gosia Piatek: We only work with sustainable yarn that has an ethical production chain. Our cotton is certified fair trade by the Fairtrade Labelling Organisation and certified organic by the Global Organic Textile Standard. We have recently started working with New Zealand ZQ certified merino which has the highest standard in animal welfare. We use Italian-made recycled hemp buttons and nickel-free German made denim tacks.  We also sea ship all our production and are constantly working on new and innovative ways to improve our collection and workroom practices. We care about all the details and want to create positive impact with what we do.  Because of our ethical and sustainable production chain, we are required to work further in advance to most fashion brands. We do not work with fabric off the roll and instead develop our own from scratch‚Äîdesigning the warp, weft, color, weight, and wash. This means we have to start design 18 months prior to delivery and ensures we produce garments completely exclusive to us.  We recently opened our first flagship store in New Zealand and unlike other brands we ensured the store fit out was in line with our sustainability values. All our wood is sourced locally, paper lanterns are made with traditional techniques in Japan, the sofas are made from New Zealand wool, rugs are made from regenerated nylon, and counter-top tiles are hand made by a past collaborator. What did you feel was missing in the fashion conversation, what did you want to do differently?  When I started Kowtow 11 years ago, sustainability and ethics were not prevalent words in the fashion industry. I found that I could not speak too openly about this subject as people often associated sustainable fashion with design that wasn't desirable. Today, the fashion landscape could not be anymore different with large fast fashion chains now incorporating sustainable lines into their range. It is exciting to be able to talk to our customers about where our cotton and wool comes from, where our trims are sourced from and who makes our collections. We find that our customers are now so much more engaged in this subject and it's exciting to show them that we are at the forefront of the movement.   What do you dislike about how people talk about eco/sustainable/responsible fashion?  Sometimes consumers can just read a buzz word like "eco" or "sustainable" and buy it simply if the packaging has these words on it. However, I think there are massive differences how one brand does it to another and for many it is still token. For us, we work with fair-trade-certified farmers from seed to garment, we are a genuinely curious workplace and do not hold back from addressing the elephants in the room and are constantly coming up with solutions. How would you describe your aesthetic? Utilitarian, minimal, and understated femininity. What do you think the future of fashion should look like? What is ‚Äúideal consumerism?‚Äù in your opinion? Great question! What if our clothing was biodegradable? A wonderfully mastered circular economy where everything was recycled and reused. A world with no fashion waste. What if we could bring back manufacturing into every country rather than a small number of countries producing for the whole world? What if we purchased with our minds, not frivolously‚Äîand we cared, repaired, and cherished our clothing? In my heart I am hoping that we are working towards this greener and healthier future.
 Sister suit off.  From the runways to street style and beyond, pantsuits have been going through a major fashion revival for the past few seasons now (thanks in part to Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential run). But Bella and Gigi Hadid just took the look to new territory while out in Paris.  In the midst of Paris Fashion Week, the model sisters were both spotted leaving the Royal Monceau hotel in statement-making suits. Instead of taking the classic jacket and trousers route, both Gigi and Bella opted for a twist on the trend.  Gigi stepped out in a bright blue satin set hand-painted with colorful flowers by Andreas Kronthaler for Vivienne Westwood. Lending a sporty, track pant-inspired vibe to the look, her trousers featured a stripe down the leg. She topped off the art-infused suit with clear PVC sandals and jeweled drop earrings.     Bella, meanwhile, opted for a short skirt suit by Fendi. Proving logomania is officially back, the younger Hadid sister's suit was covered in the brand's logo. She topped it off with small, Matrix-inspired sunglasses, black tights, and classic pumps for a modern-day Working Girl vibe.  Spotted on countless Fall 2018 runways this season, the retro skirt suit is back in full force‚Äîand naturally Bella was amongst the first to test-drive the look off the runway. Though each Hadid opted for a different take on the look, both proved the suit is going to new heights this season‚Äîwhether in the form of a colorful satin look √° la Gigi or an '80s-inspired Working Girl version √† la Bella. 
 Tyler Joe captures the best dressed fashion week guests... We're on the last leg of the Spring 2020 collections, but rather than start to falter towards the end, fashion month show-goer's really bring it for the Paris runways. See what the chic set wears to take in fresh seasons of Dior, Chanel, Vuitton, Loewe and more. Vittoria mixes corduroy blazers with cropped knits. Julie layers menswear inspired pieces with ease. Tamu loves a bold, statement coat. Fair Isle knits are always a good idea. These gold Chanel boots are luxury gone fun. Bettina Looney wears a black croc coat, belted at the waist.

 "A show like this is a game changer and a hope creator," says model Candice Huffine. Tonight, 11 Honor√© will stage their first ever runway show to kick off the New York Fashion Week's Winter 2019 season. The luxury e-commerce site, which launched in 2016, has been disrupting the fashion industry's slim standards as it specifically caters to women sizes 10 and up. Prabal Gurung, Christopher Kane, Altuzarra, Marc Jacobs and many more high fashion brands who have traditionally only provided up to sizes 10 or 12, have all risen to the task of providing extended sizing for the site.  Patrick Herning, founder of 11 Honor√©, knows just how important it is for their customers to see themselves being represented in the media and major events at New York Fashion Week. "As a company, we thrive on being first. We were first to market as the first multi-designer e-commerce platform for the plus customer and we are thrilled to be able to continue providing luxury designer options for her. My biggest hope is that people will see the value and beauty of what we're doing and understand further the shift that is happening within the fashion industry and our culture as becoming more diverse and inclusive." So what better what to kick things off than with a fabulous runway show at Spring Studios and tapping the best of the industry to get involved. Elizabeth Stewart, celebrity stylist to A-list names such as Cate Blanchett, Gal Gadot and Viola Davis, has been brought on to style the runway debut. The stylist says the transition between red carpet to runway is simple, "I am working with strong, confident and beautiful women who can wow and inspire the world regardless of their size." But she recognizes just how big of a moment this really is. "It‚Äôs really important to me that all aspects of my work are inclusive. The site has already had a huge impact on women who wear over a size 12, giving them access to designers they have never had access to before‚Ä¶now we are spreading the word further!" Stewart told Bazaar.   Top model Candice Huffine will do the honors of opening tonight's show at Spring Studios, as she's been apart of the 11 Honor√© family from the start. "There‚Äôs a bigger picture to what I feel 11 Honor√© will accomplish this Fashion Week. Yes, it‚Äôs about clothing at the end of the day, but really look at everything a show like this represents and tell me there isn‚Äôt a vital need for this kind of inclusion always," says Huffine. "A show like this is a game changer and a hope creator and I think the energy it will bring to this week will change the landscape of fashion forever."

 Twiggy, Jane Birkin, and more show how true seventies style is done.  There‚Äôs a reason the 1970s continues to be one of the most stylish decades of all time. From flares to bell sleeves, shearling coats, and mini skirts, the ‚Äò70s birthed an eclectic mix of style influences that evolved quickly in a 10-year span. Skirts got shorter, boots got taller, and a range of style icons like Jane Birkin and Jean Shrimpton helped spearhead some of the era‚Äôs most memorable fashion moments. Take a look back at some of the looks that helped define the decade's style‚Äîand continue to inspire today.  Goldie Hawn looks summer-ready in her yellow ruffled crop top and navy skirt.  Italian TV presenter, actress, singer, and showgirl Raffaella Carr√† sports a floral-printed silk nightgown with puffy bell sleeves.  Lounging in a wicker hanging chair with floral accents, a model is wears a long-sleeved tunic with sparkling tights and metallic cap-toe shoes.  Jackie Kennedy steps out in a classic black turtle neck, belted coat, and perfectly tailored trousers. A mini skirt-clad look that walked the runway at Pierre Cardin's fashion show in Berlin, Germany.  Olivia Newton John wears a fur chubby and matching hat with red wide-leg pants while out in London.  Iconic '60s supermodel Jean Shrimpton lounges on a couch while wearing a floral mini dress and black Mary Jane shoes.   Showcasing a dramatic take on '70s glamour, a model wears a sequin-embellished cape jumpsuit paired with oversized earrings.   A fashion editorial from the pages of Cosmopolitan features a chicly suited up woman‚Äîcomplete with the decade's signature oversized sunglasses‚Äîat a cafe.  Catherine Deneuve layers a menswear vest over a classic green blouse, floral print knee-length skirt, and brown leather knee-high boots. A model accessorizes her floral dress with a beret, choker necklace, and bangles.  Stylish suiting will always be in. A model wears a white tailored suit with a crocheted beret while backstage at Chanel's Haute Couture show in Paris.  Diane von Furstenberg and husband Prince Egon von F√ºrstenberg wear matching checked button down shirts and belted trousers.  It doesn't get more '70s than a multicolor patchwork dress featuring dramatic bell sleeves. A model wears a babydoll-inspired set with a wide-brim hat and espadrille sandals while out in a park. All leather everything. This casual red t-shirt keeps the burgundy patent leather hat, jacket and matching mini skirt paired with a black patent leather boot from looking overdone. A woman wears a wide-leg jumpsuit by Pembroke Squires of Cabana complete with cut-out details at the back. Even when she hung out on bales of hay, Jean Shrimpton always looked polished and put-together. Proving the classic style formula of solid-colored button-up and tailored pants, are always a good look. Model Celia Hammond, who is now an activist against the fur industry, was snapped rocking a cozy shearling coat over her top, mini skirt, and knee-high boots.  Mod mini dresses and white over-the-knee boots were a staple outfit formula from the early 1970s. A fashion model looks lady-like and youthful in her matching separates. Her fuchsia scarf tied around her hat adds a fun pop of color to her otherwise natural full look. Channeling a Western-inspired look, a model wears a midi dress with knee-high striped socks tucked into a pair of cowboy boots.  Milanese model Elizabeth Douglas-Drury dons an ultra-warm sable coat by Zibellino Russo at the brand's fashion show.  A woman shows off a colorful faux fur coat by designer Ossie Clark while walking down the street. Hanging out on the beach, a model wears an orange sleeve jumpsuit with her collar flipped up and the front zipper, pulled down to which adds an adventurous element to her otherwise laidback fit.  Posing in a d√©colletage-baring jumpsuit from Lolli Popowska, this model pairs the daring look with a pair of crimplene stocking shoes complete with a low-heel.  A model shows off a chunky crocheted poncho with a thigh-baring slit.  Model Moica Platne is photographed in a black and silver print  dress and a matching headscarf.  Posing in fall foliage, this model wears a hooded fall coat featuring houndstooth detailing with a pair of boots.

 50% of proceeds from each necklace will be donated to the ACLU Women‚Äôs Rights Fund. Ruth Bader Ginsburg has used her Supreme Court position to advocate for women's rights and equality for decades now. But in the process, the Justice has also become a style icon in her own right‚Äînamely for her many statement-making collars. To celebrate her legacy, Banana Republic is reissuing one of RBG's most famous accessories, her "dissent collar," and it's all for a good cause.  Since 2012, RBG has worn the same sparkling Banana Republic bib necklace as a sartorial way to express her disapproval. She frequently wears it whenever she disagrees with a Supreme Court decision and more notably, she also opted to wear it the day after Donald Trump was elected President in 2016. The Justice once told Katie Couric that she chose the piece as her "dissent collar" simply because it "looked fitting for dissents." (And that is why they call her the Notorious RBG, folks.)  RBG: "This is my dissenting collar‚Ä¶ It looks fitting for dissents." pic.twitter.com/luNmrN4BCX Because we all have reason to frequently show our dissent these days, Banana Republic is reissuing the Supreme Court justice's original collar necklace for a limited time. The brand is donating 50% of proceeds from each necklace sold to the ACLU Women‚Äôs Rights Project, which was co-founded by Bader Ginsberg to advocate for gender equality and women‚Äôs economic rights.  
  Now available for pre-order, the $98 Notorious RBG-approved necklace has (unsurprisingly) already sold out. The good news, however, is that Banana Republic plans to produce another order of the coveted necklaces. For now, those wanting their own RBG dissent collar can DM @bananarepublic on Instagram with their email address to be added to the wait-list.   The response to our Dissent Collar Necklace has been tremendous ‚Äî and heartwarming. In just a few hours, we pre-sold all units of the necklace that were made in limited edition for January delivery. Given the overwhelming response, we are working quickly to create additional quantities.  Head to the #LinkInBio to be added to the waitlist and notified when we re-stock. Thank you for standing with us to support equality and the @aclu_nationwide Women‚Äôs Rights Project. ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚û°Ô∏è bit.ly/DissentCollarBR A post shared by  Banana Republic (@bananarepublic) on Jan 8, 2019 at 10:57am PST
 The Stella McCartney dress can now be yours.  Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan Markle's royal wedding may have been over 6 months ago, but if you thought we'd moved on from all the looks, think again. While there were several noteworthy dresses (including two wedding gowns from the bride), one guest in particular stood out that day: Amal Clooney.  Donning a bright canary-yellow Stella McCartney dress and matching veiled hat, the human rights lawyer stunned in her wedding guest look and now, it's finally available to shop.  Featuring a square neckline, cap sleeves, and draped asymmetrical train, the sunny dress has aptly been named the "Amal Tie-Back Crepe Dress" by the brand. Making for the perfect guest attire for a spring wedding (royal or not), the Stella McCartney design is available to shop at Matches Fashion for $1,995.  Though there were several standout fashion moments at the May wedding‚Äîfrom Priyanka Chopra's lavender Vivienne Westwood dress to Serena Williams' pink Versace frock‚ÄîAmal's was one of the most-talked-about guest looks from the event. According to fashion search engine Lyst, the dress garnered 17,000 searches for ‚Äòyellow Stella McCartney dress' by people from 65 different countries in the week following the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's nuptials.  Looks like wedding guest season is about to get a lot brighter this spring. 
 The supermodel made another rare runway appearance at Paris Fashion Week.  After walking the runway at last week's Versace show alongside fellow '90s supermodels, Naomi Campbell made another catwalk cameo tonight at Off-White's Spring 2018 show in Paris.  The super walked the runway in a white ruffled blazer and cropped spandex leggings featuring an 'Off' logo. Campbell's look, along with Off-White's entire spring collection, was inspired by Princess Diana. Over the summer, creative director Virgil Abloh revealed this season would pay homage to the late royal's style, coinciding with the 20th anniversary of her tragic death this past August. As for Naomi's look, it combined both Diana's penchant for tailored jackets as well as the casual athleticwear she donned during her downtime.  Abloh's moodboard for the collection featured eight of Diana's most distinct styles labeled as: Charity, Mom, Being a Princess, Night, Young Diana, Countryside Girl, Casual, and Jogging. It seems as though Campbell's look was a cross between "Jogging" Diana and "Being A Princess" Diana.   " one woman, 40 @off____white looks in the works come september " A post shared by @ virgilabloh on Jul 26, 2017 at 6:28am PDT After leading the finale runway walk, Campbell then posed with Off-White designer Virgil Abloh, whom she soon after congratulated on Instagram.  .@NaomiCampbell working üëè it üëè in @virgilabloh's Off-White #PFW show [via IG/jamorr] pic.twitter.com/KpGprI1Jti Icon recognize icon. 
 The supermodel was glowing on the red carpet.  Miranda Kerr has kept a low profile since confirming her second pregnancy in November‚Äîbut last night she proudly displayed her growing bump on the carpet of the Warner Bros.'s Golden Globes afterparty.  The supermodel, who arrived without husband Evan Spiegel, wore a sexy curve-hugging Balmain halter gown with black leopard print‚Äîkeeping in theme with the night of showing solidarity with women and the Time's Up movement. The former Victoria's Secret Angel looked excited to be a mother for the second time, holding her baby bump as she posed for the photographers.  And the health-conscious mom couldn't resists a dessert station at the afterparty, she posted a video on Instagram of herself taking a bite out of a glazed donut.   üòãü§∞üèªüç© A post shared by  Miranda (@mirandakerr) on Jan 7, 2018 at 10:32pm PST Kerr married the Snapchat founder in an intimate ceremony at the couple's home in May of 2017. Over the weekend they celebrated Kerr's first son, whom she shares with ex-husband Orlando Bloom, Flynn's 7th birthday.   Happy Birthday to my little angel ‚ù§Ô∏è üéÇüòáüôèüèª‚ú® A post shared by  Miranda (@mirandakerr) on Jan 6, 2018 at 6:37pm PST There has been no word on the sex of Kerr and Spiegel's first child or when the baby is due. 
 Envisioning a more inclusive industry.  The fashion industry has always been exclusive‚Äîbut even more so if you happened to be above a size 10 or 12. If you've ever eyed a runway look for next season‚Äôs wardrobe, chances are the brand wouldn‚Äôt make it in your size, unless you went straight to the designer for a custom-made dress.  But now, 11Honor√© is out to change that game completely. Founded in 2017 by Patrick Herning and Kathryn Retzer, the online retailer just raised $8 million in Series-A financing from Redpoint Ventures and is working with some of today's top designers from Michael Kors to Zac Posen, Brandon Maxwell, Jonathan Simkhai and beyond on extended sizing for historically underserved customers. "We are leading the conversation around size inclusive designer fashion. Our customer deserves a luxury shopping experience and an even better edit of clothing. In the current retail landscape, whether ecommerce or brick and mortar, sizes 12 and above are rarely stocked,‚Äù says Herning, whose company is also helping provide the technology for designers who are interested in creating a wider size run.   11Honor√© is ‚Äúdisrupting the high-end fashion market,‚Äù as Herning says, and it is clear in every facet, from their business model to the creative. This season they've selected model-on-the-rise Precious Lee to front their Spring 2018 campaign. "Precious is a trailblazer in the fashion industry and has been an outspoken advocate for diversity and inclusivity in fashion. Precious has broken down walls in this industry and we had the best time collaborating with her to show the world that luxury comes in all shapes and sizes," says Retzer who oversees 11Honor√©‚Äôs creative direction.   No one lives the 11Honor√© life more than Ms, Lee. The Atlanta native said she was always a fan of high fashion, but struggled to find clothes in her size. ‚ÄúWomen of larger sizes want access to high end brands and 11Honor√© is giving it to them‚ÄîI think it‚Äôs genius and long awaited,‚Äù Lee told Bazaar.com. Lee knows that her position as a model has also afforded her a platform to affect change‚Äîone that she does not take lightly. ‚ÄúMy job is not just a model, but I‚Äôm also an activist. I‚Äôm putting in the work to make a shift in how society views beauty and that to me is priceless.‚Äù  She didn't originally set out to be in the pages of magazines though, Lee was planning to be an attorney. "I‚Äôve always had a love for advocacy and inspiring people. So when I was approached to become a 'plus' model, I realized that my work could empower and inspire people on a larger platform. It‚Äôs so rewarding for me to know that my work is helping young girls and women love themselves more by seeing me in editorials, campaigns and commercials. I‚Äôm a size 14/16,  I‚Äôm black and I want to show that fashion has a place for us."  As a black woman and plus-size model, Lee is more than aware of how the fashion industry typically favors and promotes a narrow view of beauty. She‚Äôs faced pushback on everything from her name to her hair and breast size. Her first agency changed her name to Victoria Lee as they we were worried about any negative connotations or associations with the movie ‚ÄúPrecious‚Äù starring Gabourey Sidibe.    Even within plus-size specific jobs, 5-foot-11 beauty has been no stranger to criticism. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve had people tell me my boobs were too big and even suggest a reduction, but I refuse to alter my body for the sake of other‚Äôs opinion. My opinion matters most and I love my boobs. Boobs are chic too, you know?‚Äù As Lee said, she's determined to prove that there is a place for everyone in this industry. Nevertheless, it's obvious that there's still much improvement to be made. So, where would the model like to see the fashion community in five years? "I‚Äôd love to see designers include women of color and larger sizes in campaigns on a regular. Not as a gimmick or fad. But as a desired model because there are so many beautiful women we can display. Why stay stagnant in thought when it comes to fashion‚Äî an industry that I always expected to be freeing and innovative. Why is the industry hell bent on the same ole same ole? I hope designers existing and to-come are not afraid to show a real representation of beauty, which is boundless. A strong, sexy, size-16, black woman that knows how to take an epic picture deserves magazine covers, I mean,  why not?" Why not, indeed! 
 See the top models from the '60s to today making their runway debut.  You may know your favorite supermodels by their legendary runway walks, hang-on-the-wall-worthy fashion editorials, and iconic sense of style, but what about the catwalk that kicked off their runway career? From '60s It model Twiggy to the supers of the '90s and the top models of today, we're taking a look back at the runways that helped skyrocket these models onto the radar.  1967 Halston Resort 1974 Mary McFadden Fall 1976 Perry Ellis 1979 Yves Saint Laurent Fall 1987 Michael Kors Spring 1988 Michael Kors Spring 1988 Chanel Couture Spring 1989 John Galliano Spring 1990 Donna Karan Spring 1991 Ralph Lauren 1993 1990  Chanel Couture Fall 1991 Jil Sander Fall 1992 Jil Sander Fall 1992 Yves Saint Laurent Spring 1992 Chanel Fall 1993 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show 1997 Alexander McQueen Spring 1998 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show 1999 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show 2000 Diane von Furstenberg Spring 2001 Calvin Klein Fall 2002 Jesus del Pozo Spring 2003 Wayne Cooper 2003 Prada Fall 2003 Miu Miu Fall 2004 Cynthia Steffe Spring 2005 Vivienne Tam Spring 2005 Heatherette Fall 2005
 Karl Lagerfeld delivers yet another incredible set at Paris Fashion Week.  Chanel doesn't do simple or understated when it comes to runway shows‚Äîand this season was no exception. For Spring 2019, Karl Lagerfeld transformed Paris's Grand Palais into Chanel By The Sea‚Äîa sandy and serene beach getaway complete with its own ocean and on-duty lifeguard.  Of course, if there's anywhere we'd like to escape to right now, it's Chanel Beach. Models walked barefoot, carrying their shoes in hand as they walked the sand-filled runway. The scenic beachscape was even complete with its own tiki hut and mini boardwalk, which Karl later took his final bow on.   Went to the beach this morning @chanelofficial A post shared by  Reese Blutstein (@double3xposure) on Oct 2, 2018 at 2:44am PDT  Chilling at the beach with the @chanelofficial girls üñ§üñ§ #ChanelByTheSea #ChanelSpringSummer A post shared by  Caroline de Maigret üá´üá∑ (@carolinedemaigret) on Oct 2, 2018 at 3:20am PDT As for the collection, it was the kind of beachwear that would make you want to book a one-way ticket to Chanel Beach stat. There were oversized straw hats, vacation-ready swimsuits, and Chanel logos in the form of belts, bathing suits, and cardigans.  Along with a lineup of colorful sundresses and swimwear looks, there were still bouts of classic Chanel signatures like tweed and suiting, which were reinvented for a more laid-back and summery setting‚Äîespecially ideal if you have to take a meeting on the Mediterranean.  There were some surprises, namely that bike shorts and even leggings have officially landed the Chanel seal of approval. After taking over street style and appearing on countless runways this season, the throwback spandex look hit the runways at Chanel, too. They were styled with oversized tweed blazers and matching print sweater sets that elevated the look.  Accessory-wise, there were bags and sandals that will have us all counting down the days until next spring/summer. An array of colorful logo sandals were carried down the runway in pinks, blues, and a classic black and white logo flat that's sure to take over amongst the fashion crowd next season.  Most interesting, however, was the fact that models carried not one, but two Chanel handbags at a time. After all, more is more in the land of Chanel. 
 Denim on denim is having a moment.  When it comes to style, Rihanna and Kendall Jenner work two very different sides of the fashion spectrum. The former is known to rock risk-taking, high-fashion looks both on and off the red carpet, while the latter has mastered a seasoned model off-duty look. But last night, the unthinkable occurred when the two stepped out in different cities wearing the same outfit.   While in London, Bad Gal Riri left the Arts Club in Mayfair in a denim jacket and matching jeans. Meanwhile in Los Angeles, Jenner also took the Canadian tuxedo route and doubled up on a lighter-wash denim jacket and jeans.   Each making the look their own, Rihanna topped her look off with a pair of red velvet heels whereas Kendall opted for a sleek pair of black patent boots. Whether your style resonates more with the singer or the model, it's clear to see denim on denim is here to stay for fall. 
 Mariel Sholem caters to the world's most elite shoppers‚Äîthink private jets and dinner with Donatella Versace. This is her world. Picture this: You‚Äôre standing in the Sistine Chapel, marveling at Michelangelo‚Äôs frescoed ceiling in silent reverence. The room is nearly empty, and the usual throngs of tourists are nowhere to be found. It‚Äôs just you, the guards, and your personal shopper from Saks. That might sound like a dream, but it's exactly what Mariel Kriss Sholem and her team can do. Sholem is the Director of SaksFirst Limitless, the invite-only premium rewards program for the department store‚Äôs spend-iest shoppers.   On that morning in Italy, dressed in head-to-toe Louis Vuitton, a SaksFirst Limitless client entered the historic chapel at dawn before anyone else was allowed in. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs when I thought: ‚ÄòWow, we really can make anything happen,‚Äô‚Äù says Sholem.  Becoming a client requires consistent Saks loyalty, which boils down to at least half a dozen store visits a year and a spend threshold in the six figures.  To put that into perspective, base-level customers who spend up to $5,000 a year are considered Premier status. Three levels away are the Diamond-status members, who are required to drop $25,000 a year or more. Both of those programs include a points-based reward system for every dollar spent. The SaksFirst Limitless program is like Diamond status on steroids. It's a membership so exclusive that it‚Äôs rarely promoted and its experiences are never publicized‚Äîuntil now.   In a different life, Sholem could have been a politician. At Emory University, the International Studies Major thought she was bound for work in law or government. After college, her marketing concentration led her into the advertising agency world.  It wasn‚Äôt until she joined Chanel‚Äîand remained there for the next seven years‚Äîthat she would learn to both entertain and troubleshoot at such a glamorous level. ‚ÄúAs soon as I started at Chanel, their world of luxury and the idea of captivating a customer became something I was fascinated with,‚Äù she recalls. Now, she manages the coordination and execution of these personalized fashion experiences. In layman‚Äôs terms, that means offering the best of the best to the highest-tier shoppers. Her days include lunches at L‚ÄôAvenue at Saks‚Äîthe newly-opened restaurant inside the Saks Fifth Avenue flagship‚Äîstudio visits with some of Saks‚Äô designers, and galas after work to support different clients‚Äô philanthropic efforts. Year-round, she‚Äôs planning for the biannual whirlwind that is Fashion Month.   ¬† . . ¬† ¬† ¬†  Every day is different, because every experience is tailored to a unique client. ‚ÄúThere truly is not a one-size-fits-all approach, and we evaluate invitations to the program based on a variety of criteria,‚Äù Sholem insists. On average, about 150 to 250 invitations are sent a year. To date, only 300 Saks shoppers are a part of the program. An annual spend of at least $100,000 isn‚Äôt the only requirement to become a SaksFirst Limitless member. Clients are also selected based off of how interested they are in fashion experiences and luxury brands, as well as their relationship with their sales associate.  "A healthy obsession for ready-to-wear and a penchant for fine jewelry helps," says Sholem. Loose translation: Fashion fanatics who swim in Carolina Herrera, Valentino, and Chanel; who shop enough at Saks to consider their sales associate a close friend; and who can also drop tens of thousands of dollars on clothes, shoes, and accessories‚Äîroutinely. SaksFirst Limitless members are routinely flown all over the world. Clients have gone to Florence to be the first to view Gucci creative director Alessandro Michele‚Äôs new jewelry collection. (Also included in that trip: a private tour of Gucci Garden; wine tastings at vineyards favored by the fashion house; and luggage filled to the brim with straight-off-the-runway‚Äîyou guessed it‚ÄîGucci.)  A different client might make a large Cartier transaction at Saks on a Monday, then privately tour its watch-making factory in Geneva on a Tuesday. Another might fly to Lake Tahoe for the Oscar de la Renta resort show; earlier that day, they would have been dressed by a Saks stylist in that collection.  ‚ÄúClients at this level have such great loyalty to Saks that we can make anything happen. Anything is possible,‚Äù explains Sholem. On one very rare occasion, the Graff family opened the doors to their very private, highly secured luxury jewelry vault. Inside a nondescript building in London, SaksFirst Limitless shoppers toured the busy workshop teeming with artisans and some of the rarest gems in the world. ‚ÄúWho could forget a free-standing 25-carat diamond?‚Äù recalls Sholem. Sholem and her team don't just triage a problem should one arise; they perform the concierge equivalent of surgical repair. In the event that the luggage is delayed, a SaksFirst Limitless team member will ensure a client isn't stuck waiting at the airport. Instead, they'll be comfortable‚Äîand distracted‚Äîin a premier hotel suite or at one of the city's most hard-to-get-into restaurants. As awe-inducing as some of the most extravagant experiences are‚Äîa private tour of Coco Chanel‚Äôs apartment, attending the Royal Ascot with the royal family‚Äîsmaller-scale efforts make up the DNA of the SaksFirst Limitless program. For Sholem, the devil is in the details. The experience that really delivers that wow-factor? Surprisingly, it's Saturday Night Live. ‚ÄúLet me tell you,‚Äù says Sholem. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the most impossible ticket to get.‚Äù Styled by Allison Bornstein, Hair and makeup by Ellen Guhin
 An exec from the company confirmed the news.   This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. After months of reports and speculation, Victoria's Secret has confirmed that it will not host its annual runway show this year. Stuart B. Burgdoerfer, executive vice president of Victoria's Secret parent company, L Brands, spoke about the cancellation in a phone call with analysts, WWD reports.  "We think it‚Äôs important to evolve the marketing of Victoria‚Äôs Secret. There will be more to come as that continues to get evaluated," he said.  ‚Äú[The show] was a very important part of the brand building of this business and was an important aspect of the brand and a remarkable marketing achievement," he added, per WWD. "And with that said, we‚Äôre figuring out how to advance the positioning of the brand and best communicate that to customers and that‚Äôs among the things that [Victoria‚Äôs Secret chief executive officer] John [Mehas] is focused on.‚Äù The move comes months after the lingerie brand made noticeable changes to appear more inclusive following backlash, such as collaborating with Bluebella and featuring plus-size model Ali Tate Cutler in the campaign, and hiring its first openly-transgender model, Valentina Sampaio, for its athletic line, VS Pink.  It was first speculated in May that Victoria's Secret could be cancelling its famous runway extravaganza CEO Leslie Wexner sent an internal memo saying he wanted to "rethink" the concept of the show, per WWD. Since then, multiple Victoria's Secret models have publicly said that the catwalk spectacular was cancelled, but the company never confirmed the news until now.  Major change is reportedly afoot at Victoria's Secret, with a leaked internal memo (via CNBC) suggesting that the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show will no longer be broadcast on network television. Les Wexner, the CEO of L Brands which owns Victoria's Secret, apparently wrote, "Fashion is a business of change. We must evolve and change to grow. With that in mind, we have decided to re-think the traditional Victoria‚Äôs Secret Fashion Show." Wexner continued, "Going forward we don‚Äôt believe network television is the right fit. In 2019 and beyond, we‚Äôre focusing on developing exciting and dynamic content and a new kind of event‚Äîdelivered to our customers on platforms that she‚Äôs glued to‚Ä¶ and in ways that will push the boundaries of fashion in the global digital age."   It's true that, in the digital age, fashion shows are broadcast quicker than ever before. For instance, in 2018 the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show took place on November 8, but it wasn't broadcast on ABC until December 2. By the time the show finally aired on TV, fans had already seen a plethora of looks and musical performances via social media. While it's unclear what form the next generation of Victoria's Secret Fashion Show will take, it sounds as though the brand is finally ready to evolve, and that can only be a good thing.

 The feminist icon sat front row at Prabal Gurung.  You can always count on star-studded front rows at New York Fashion Week but last night, the fashion set was in for a real surprise when Gloria Steinem graced the Prabal Gurung show with her presence.  It was the feminist icon's first ever fashion show and the designer was so excited that he came out to personally greet her before the runway even began. Known to cast diverse models and use fashion to make political statements, Gurung was a fitting choice for Steinem's first NYFW experience.  To celebrate the occasion, Steinem shared a picture holding up her invitation at the show. "There is a first time for everything, even at 83! First #nyfw show @prabalgurung, a kind man doing great work in fashion and beyond," she captioned the photo.  Last season, the designer sent models down the runway in statement-making feminist t-shirts for a powerful finale moment. While there were no graphic tees on the runway this season, staff working the show all wore t-shirts that read "Stronger in Colour" and the colorful runway collection opened with an empowering voiceover of the Activist‚Äôs Prayer, ‚ÄúGrant me the strength to change the things I cannot accept.‚Äù From the diverse lineup to the Activist's Prayer opening and Gloria Steinem sitting front row, the designer proved you don't need logo t-shirts to make fashion a force for good.

 BAZAAR's digital fashion director reveals her current wish list... All of the pieces from Fall that BAZAAR's fashion/features director is adding to her cart‚Äîfrom cool jackets to hair bows, and the chicest white boots. I consider trench coats one of the hallmarks of my personal style‚Äîand this one is just about perfect by one of my favorite young designers. There's nothing prettier to me than a simple cashmere sweater, jeans, and a hair bow. I'm adding this to my collection. We've been in the realm of oversized Dad blazers for so long that a chic little crop feels entirely fresh right now. I am enamored with all things ceramic‚Äîand Simone's Bodner Turner's vessel is a keeper.¬† I want all of my pants oversized, yet cinched at the waist. Consider these a modern chino. Raffia is not for summer-only. Sign me up for this beautiful mini by Hunting Season‚Äîa bag brand that I can't seem to quit.¬† I'm a denim girl through and through. This curved shape brings a '90s inspired baggy silhouette into 2019. A white boot is the ultimate luxury‚Äîa true car -to-curb situation that's worth all the fuss.¬† I never said I'm completely over oversized jackets‚ÄîMagda Butrym gets cool girl clothes right. I adore a baker boy hat, it just makes my look finished. I'm taking the idea cozy this season. This now iconic belt is basically jewelry. I will wear it with everything from jeans to sweater dresses. I love everything this brand is doing‚Äîand this is just that special piece that stands out in your closet.¬† Black cashmere is my forever go-to and I love a varsity shape, which means it's weird that I don't own this sweater yet.
 The designer is sticking to the style signature he perfected at Saint Laurent.  All eyes were on Hedi Slimane today as he sent his first collection for Celine down the runway at Paris Fashion Week. After debuting a new logo (sans the √© accent) and his first Celine bag on the arm of Lady Gaga, many wondered what the creative director had up his sleeve for the brand previously helmed by Phoebe Philo. And according to today's runway show, it's a whole new Celine.  Sticking to the '80s glam he made his signature at Saint Laurent, Slimane sent a collection full of glitzy, party-ready looks and suiting down the Celine runway. There were sparkling mini dresses, studded leather, and exaggerated '80s silhouettes. The collection, which featured both men's and women's, included a total of 96 looks.  It was a stark contrast from Phoebe Philo's tailored masculine-meets-feminine take on the brand. Now, an array of sparkling minis and feathered frocks suggested the new Celine woman is more interested in dressing for the party scene than for the office. As each look hit the runway, it was impossible not to think of Slimane's Saint Laurent‚Äîthe similarities so striking.  On Twitter, many were upset that Slimane had so drastically changed the aesthetic of Celine. And many were also quick to call out the resemblance between Slimane's Saint Laurent and Slimane's Celine.  Hedi does Hedi (at Dior) does Hedi (at Saint Laurent) does Hedi (at Celine) does Hedi ... Will be interesting to see whether Saint Laurent fans stay loyal to Saint Laurent now that Celine is ALSO Saint Laurent. What in the Saint Laurent happened on the Celine runway? üò© pic.twitter.com/E90CgGmqiT celine was... so... ............... i‚Äôm calling the police pic.twitter.com/bots0D3C7A Slimane was appointed as the new artistic, creative, and image director for Celine back in February, succeeding Phoebe Philo's 10-year run as creative director. And while his signature '80s glam-meets-grunge aesthetic seemed to work well at Saint Laurent, it‚Äôll be interesting to see whether that remains true for the Celine woman.

 The Italian fashion house is the latest luxury brand to make the switch.  Following the takeover of those ubiquitous fur-lined backless loafers, Gucci is officially going fur-free, starting with its Spring 2018 collection.  The announcement was made by CEO Marco Bizarri today during the 2017 Kering Talk at The London College of Fashion. After working with The Humane Society of the U.S. and LAV (an Italian-based animal welfare group), Gucci's joining of the Fur Free Alliance ensures the brand will stop all use of animal fur including mink, coyote, raccoon dog, fox, rabbit, karakul, and all other species specially bred or caught for fur. ‚ÄúBeing socially responsible is one of Gucci‚Äôs core values, and we will continue to strive to do better for the environment and animals. With the help of HSUS and LAV, Gucci is excited to take this next step and hopes it will help inspire innovation and raise awareness, changing the luxury fashion industry for the better," Bizarri said of the brand's decision.  Considering its many statement-making fur coats and staple fur-lined mules, the announcement is a pretty big move for the Italian fashion house. In the beginning of 2017, Gucci started inching towards this new stance by halting the use of Kangaroo fur in its Princetown loafer line, opting to use lamb's wool instead. Gucci is just the latest luxury brand to ban the use of fur, following Stella McCartney, Giorgio Armani, Hugo Boss, and Net-A-Porter. Considering its impact on not only the Kering group but the luxury fashion industry in general, this is probably just the first of many more brands to finally go fur-free. 
 We're here for the tie dye, crochet and denim on denim.  By now you know Revolve is synonymous with killer clothes and larger-than-life parties. This year was no different, as the online retailer built out their own actual festival in La Quinta, California. From a star musical lineup (SZA, Offset, and Cardi B just to name a few) to rival the actual Coachella festival, to tons of Instagram-worthy activations, it was the ultimate playground for top fashion influencers like Aimee Song, Camila Coehlo, Leonie Hanne and many more. So we combed through all the instagrams for the best style takeaways to carry throughout the next few months.  Boots don't have to be packed away when the temperates rise, just pair them with your most feminine frock.  Matching separates are here to stay, especially ones in bright floral prints. A white crochet dress is peak summer style, elevate it with earrings that sparkle and a bright bag.  Never be afraid to match your surroundings.  Florals? Off-the-shoulder? Layered? Sounds like the perfect summer dress to us.  White boots are the go-to for any occasion.  Sometimes crochet is better worn as a two piece, as demonstrated by the top model.  There's no denying that tie-dye is about to be everywhere this season‚Äîas is neon.  Channel your inner Bardot in a ruched summer dress.  The Victoria's Secret Angel is here to tell you that denim Bermuda shorts are here to stay.  Sometimes the balance to a sexy summer dress is a cool pair of sneakers and a button down shirt.  Polka dots are the hottest print of the season. 
 Dior opening Paris Fashion Week with a stunning dance performance.  Never one to disappoint, Dior kicked off Day 1 of Paris Fashion Week with a stunning runway dance performance.  The Spring 2019 show opened with a theatrical routine choreographed by Israeli choreographer Sharon Eyal. As rose petals fell from the ceiling, the modern dance performance lasted the duration of the show, with dancers weaving in and out of models walking the runway in Dior's latest collection. In a beautiful finale moment, a parade of models merged with the group of ballet dancers on the runway.  For spring, creative director Maria Grazia Chiuri was (obviously) inspired by dance, but more so, the movements of the body. Outside the show, the venue entrance was covered in enlarged quotes that inspired the designer's vision for the collection. One by German dancer Pina Bausch read, "I'm not interested in how people move, I'm interested in what makes them move," while another quote by Isadora Duncan read, "Dance is the movement of the universe concentrated in an individual." Those sentiments translated into a collection of dance-inspired pieces that seemed to flow from the body in an array of earthy muted tones. There were obvious references to dance‚Äîlike leotards and lace-up ballerina-inspired shoes‚Äîand more subtle interpretations in the form of ethereal tulle gowns, some of which were done in feminine florals or lace.  Don't worry, though, there was still room for some new renditions of the beloved Dior saddle bag.  You can watch the Dior Spring 2019 show in its entirety below: 
 
 The model enlists her inner circle for a collaboration with photographer Juergen Teller. Adwoa Aboah, the British Fashion Awards Model of the Year, collaborated with photographer Juergen Teller for a new series of photos for Burberry, commissioned by creative director Christopher Bailey. Though she's one of the biggest modeling stars of 2017, Aboah's work doesn't stop in front of the camera. The 25-year-old Brit worked with Teller on casting talent, finding a location, and choosing the aesthetic of the shoot.  The result was a project literally close to home for the model, who chose to pose with her friends and family members along Regent's Canal in North London. Together, they sport some of key pieces with Burberry's signature plaid (with a slight neon upgrade) in the form of scarves, bags, trench coats, and more.  Below are just the first of the images. The full portfolio debuts on December 26 (a belated Christmas gift) and another launches in February 2018. Aboah and fellow model Montell Martin sport neon, check, and Burberry trenchcoats. Aboah wraps up in a neon-accented Burberry tote bag, scarf, and trench. Aboah and Juergen Teller pile on the Burberry merch. Adowa poses atop her cousins Alfie Husband, Kwame N'Dow, George Husband, and Richard Theodore-Aboah, while Montell breaks out in laughter.
 But the money is going to a good cause. The Victoria's Secret Fashion Show is quickly approaching, and the details are falling into place. The show is returning to its original location of New York City, after years away in cities like London, Paris, and Shanghai. The model lineup is already taking shape, with about 18 new faces set the storm the VS runway.  And while the show's musical performers haven't been announced yet, you can expect something big, as past lineups have included acts like Harry Styles, Lady Gaga, and Rihanna. The invitation-only event is sure to be one of the hottest tickets in town, but a recent auction by VS Angel Sara Sampaio shows that the tickets are in even higher demand than most people expected. In July, Sampaio revealed to her Instagram followers that she suffers from trichotillomania, a disorder that causes her to pull out her eyebrow hairs. Sara shared her story about having trichotillomania and spread a really kind message ‚ô•Ô∏è pic.twitter.com/N9poDlGWCD Sampaio received a wave of support for her openness, and the model later decided to team with The TLC Foundation for Body-Focused Repetitive Behaviors to auction off tickets for two lucky people to see her and her fellow Angels walk the runway this year.  Whoever wins the auction will get a pair of tickets to the fashion show, a meet and greet with Sampaio, and two tickets to the official afterparty.  Guys I HAVE AWESOME NEWS! In case you would like to come and watch Victoria‚Äôs Secret Fashion Show and get a chance to hang out with me you can follow the link in my profile to bid on this exclusive package and at the same time support a cause that is dear to my heart @tlcbfrb  It would mean the world to me to raise as much as I can towards the The TLC Foundation for Body-Focused Repetitive Behaviors To end the suffering caused by hair pulling disorder, skin picking disorder, and related body-focused repetitive behaviors.

 The singer puts an edgy twist on holiday style in the ads.  Putting on her best party girl attire, Selena Gomez ushers in the holiday season for Coach's latest campaign. The singer/actress stars in the brand's holiday ads photographed by Steven Meisel on a festive night out in New York City.  In the series of photos, Gomez appears surrounded by wrapped gifts in the backseat of a vintage car before later getting behind the wheel herself. Wearing a lace floral dress, the singer puts an edgy twist on classic holiday style with a studded leather moto jacket and a shearling fur collar.  "My personal style doesn't really change around the holidays. I am happy wearing warm clothes. Coach has these amazing shearling jackets that I can't wait to wear," Gomez said in a release.  Topping off her look, she carries Coach's Dinky bag‚Äîwhich stars as the focal accessory of the brand's holiday campaign. Offered in a variety of new colors and finishes (including 3-D florals and sweet cherry prints), the Dinky reigns as the brand's It bag for the holiday season.

 The standout looks from the week's top collections. As the Fall 2019 collections unfold at New York Fashion Week, we're spotlighting the top five runway looks from all the standout shows. Consider it your sneak peek at the looks and trends that will define the upcoming season. Marc Jacobs is keeping the theatrical, capital F fashion torch burning in New York, arguably exclusively. The designer continued an emphasis on extreme volume that carried over from the past few seasons, leaving the '80s vibe behind and exploring floral prairie dresses from an avant-garde perspective. There were dramatic capes in lavender and an off-the-shoulder gown in a punchy hue of yellow. A sage slip dress referenced Jacobs' grunge-era Perry Ellis days, ones he recently resurfaced in an anniversary collection. But just like that we were transported into a series of dreamy feather gowns that make quite an entrance, paired with skater girl knit caps‚Äîa perfect juxtaposition for a designer who knows his roots, but still has a lot left to say. -Kerry Pieri Patti Hansen served as the inspiration behind Michael Kors‚Äô fall collection. The end result was a series of ultra ‚Äò70s, Studio 54-inspired pieces that channeled the model/rock ‚Äôn‚Äô roll icon‚Äôs signature look. There were patchwork jackets, shaggy faux fur coats, gold lam√© party dresses, and sequin pieces featuring the original Studio 54 logo printed across the chest. And then, the legend herself closed the show in a sparkling gold suit‚Äîhitting the runway once again for the first time since 1994. The cherry on top of Kors‚Äô nostalgic disco fest? A surprise live performance by Barry Manilow singing ‚ÄúCopacabana‚Äù for the finale walk. ‚ÄîLauren Alexis Fisher Laura Kim and Fernando Garcia are perfecting their vision at Oscar de la Renta. It‚Äôs been two years since the design duo took the creative reins at the fashion house and their Fall 2019 collection proved to be their strongest yet. Opening with a series of strong suiting, checked coats, and reimagined tweeds, the collection seamlessly transitioned into an updated take on the brand‚Äôs signature eveningwear. There was an abundance of rich textures‚Äîfrom antique rug-inspired cocktail dresses to red carpet-worthy feathers, laser-cut velvets, and and a breathtaking ball gown worn by Bella Hadid for the grand finale. It was a stunning mix of daywear and eveningwear that felt fresh, but still worthy of the late De la Renta‚Äôs approval. ‚ÄîLauren Alexis Fisher Rosie Assoulin has long mastered the art of swoon-worthy gowns, but this season she proved her design chops go well-beyond that. Amongst a mix of whimsical dresses and ballgowns, Assoulin managed to make tailored suiting and separates look just as dreamy. A floor-length skirt was styled over a button-down shirt and wide-leg trousers for the woman who wants to wear both the pants and the gown. Other standouts included a plaid suit with metallic stripes, a white shirtdress with vegan leather detailing, and colorful gown featuring gold mirror embellishments. ‚ÄîLauren Alexis Fisher Stuart Vevers is all about contrasts; juxtapositions; mix and match; opposites attract. His point of view for Coach 1941 is all about taking the frilly and fussy and pairing it with a utilitarian toughness that balances both ends out. Cap off the look with shoes you can actually strut (or stomp) the streets in, along with a carry-all that's far from a dainty clutch.  This season, tartan, basketball shorts, and chain hardware joined micro-florals and needlepoint for Vevers consonant balance between hard and soft. Per his previous offerings, this collection will likely end up on the backs of his celebrity fans: Joan Smalls, Selena Gomez, Chlo√´ Grace Moretz and more have starred as faces for the brand. ‚ÄîCarrie Goldberg
 The daughter of Harry Hamlin and Lisa Rinna says she wants to help others. Amelia Gray Hamlin, the daughter of Lisa Rinna and Harry Hamlin, made her modeling debut last year during New York Fashion Week. But the 16-year-old is now taking on a new role as an advocate, telling her own story to help others who may be suffering from an eating disorder.  In response to fans who speculated about her body changing, Hamlin opened up about her past year recovering from an eating disorder. Hamlin posted a current picture and one from last year, and left a lengthy note in her Instagram caption talking about how she realized last year ‚Äúthere was no doubt I was not okay‚Äù and decided to ‚Äústop sabotaging myself.‚Äù  She said that she still suffers health complications from ‚Äústarving‚Äù herself, and also was recently diagnosed with Hashimoto‚Äôs, a condition that affects the thyroid. (Gigi Hadid was also diagnosed with the disease.) But she said that over the past year she has learned to focus on her physical and mental health, and wants to help others who may be suffering like she was.  ‚ÄúThe first photo, taken today, is not a photo of the perfect girl,‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúThat is a photo of me, trying to figure out my body, and owing my curves that I naturally have, and not forcing myself to starve them away. One in 200 women in the US suffer from anorexia. And I want to help.‚Äù  I feel comfort with finally posting something that I wish I was confident enough to post long ago. I‚Äôm getting many comments comparing my body today vs. my body last year. I think that the support from my followers has really pushed me into writing this. Anyways, last year at this time there was no doubt that I was not okay. Not only physically but also mentally. I feel like sometimes people forget that just because your job involves being in front of the camera, doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt have bad days. We‚Äôre human. All of us. Instead of people ever commenting on my mental stability, people commented on my weight. Usually, when people are struggling with an eating disorder it stems from your mind, and your body is a reflection of it. I could go on and on about that time of my life, but the most important part about it was waking up one morning and deciding to stop sabotaging myself. My health, my physical health, my mental health and everything about myself. Once I got the help that I needed, shortly after the second photo was taken, I began to try to love myself for me. I am SO beyond humbled and grateful to have the platform that I do at such a young age, and to wake up every morning with a little girl reaching out to me and telling me I am her inspiration, really makes me feel like I have a purpose. I went through this journey not for attention, not for people to pitty me, but to help. I am on this earth to help people, and I know that. One in 200 women in the US suffer from anorexia. And I want to help. The first photo, taken today is not a photo of the perfect girl. That is a photo of me, trying to figure out my body, and owing my curves that I naturally have, and not forcing myself to starve them away. I have a lot of health complications after starving myself for so long so it‚Äôs going to be a journey that I go through for a large part of my life. I still have an extremely healthy life style and I workout so hard all week to maintain my Body. Not to say that recently being diagnosed with hashimotos has also been an extreme challenge for me to balance when still getting over this part of my life, but I am getting there. One day at a time. I want to help.

 In anticipation of her first studio album, the singer is ready to treat herself.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. In 2015, Mabel got her first big break with her single, "Know Me Better." By 2017, she was rising up the charts in the U.K. with her hit single, "Finders Keepers," a soulful love song with a dancehall beat that she worked on with her brother, a fellow musician, who sat with her in the studio for two days. The Spanish/English singer with roots in Sweden has music in her blood‚Äîher mother is singer Neneh Cherry and her father is a music producer.  By 2018, Mabel's musical reach started to extend across the pond‚Äîshe leant her vocals to popular dance song, "Ring Ring," with Jax Jones and Rich The Kid, and cemented her presence in the US with a performance on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon earlier this summer. So with her first late night TV performance under her belt, and a highly-anticipated first official studio album on the way, Mabel is looking to splurge on a new pair of heels. Not her go-to thigh-high boots for the stage, but something sexy and statement making. That's where BAZAAR.com's Special Projects Director Chrissy Rutherford comes in to help.  At the newly-opened Neiman Marcus (the retailer's first NYC outpost) at Hudson Yards, the editor and singer scour the shoe floor browsing everything from sparkly Christian Louboutin pumps to Balenciaga dad sneakers. Mabel professes she used to hate the sneakers, but now considers herself a fan. It's certainly a trend that just doesn't seem to quit.  At five foot two inches, the singer refuses to do a kitten heel, and cringes at the idea of the new Celine heels with a modest three-inch heel. Watch the latest episode to see which pair wins her heart, and keep your eye out for her debut album High Expectations dropping on August 2nd.  Don't forget to subscribe to BAZAAR's YouTube channel so you never miss an episode of Heel Hunters.
 The fashion event is in collaboration with LuisaViaRoma and will take place on June 13, 2019 in Florence Carine Roitfeld will launch her first-ever runway show, called CR Runway, in June 2019. For the fashion show's first iteration, she will be joining forces this year with Andrea Panconesi, CEO of LuisaViaRoma, to celebrate the brand's 90th anniversary. This year's show will be staged in Florence on June 13, 2019 and feature a special performance by '90s legend Lenny Kravitz.  Taking place at the historical Piazzale Michelangelo, CR Runway and LuisaViaRoma will invite 5,000 people from the public to watch and Carine will showcase her favorite pieces from the Fall/Winter 2019 collections as models recreate some of the most runway moments in history by strutting out in pairs and trios. The event will also be held during Pitti Immagine Uomo, following Clare Waight Keller's first standalone Givenchy Men's show and the debut of Raf Simons collaborator Sterling Ruby's clothing line.    The irreverent looks themselves, comprising of 90 of Carine's personally curated pieces that pay tribute to the 1990s, will honor the ultimate decade of glamour and sex appeal. The show will feature models casted by Piergiorgio Del Moro, a soundtrack curated by sound director Michel Gaubert, as well as additional musical performances to be announced.   
 "As always, numbers are very important to me, and 90 is significant to this project," Carine says. "LuisaViaRoma is celebrating its 90th anniversary this year, and the styling of these 90 show looks will draw inspiration from the 1990s, one of the most compelling decades for art and fashion. Our superstar casting will feature the top models from the era recreating iconic runway moments from the past, while a surprise musical performance will bring this nostalgia to life."    While Carine has styled the star-studded annual amFAR Cannes Runway Show, which auctions off the clothing to raise money for AIDS research, for many years now, it's always been her dream to stage a runway show of her very own. The huge milestone will be celebrated all throughout Florence, as the show will be live-streamed all over the city.

 The brand praised the late designer as "an extraordinary creative individual."  Chanel has issued a statement in response to the death of its iconic creative director, Karl Lagerfeld, who passed away in Paris at the age of 85. "It is with deep sadness that the House of Chanel announces the passing of Karl Lagerfeld, the Creative Director for the Chanel Fashion House since 1983," the brand said in a lengthy post on Instagram.  "An extraordinary creative individual, Karl Lagerfeld reinvented the brand‚Äôs codes created by Gabrielle Chanel: the Chanel jacket and suit, the little black dress, the precious tweeds, the two-tone shoes, the quilted handbags, the pearls and costume jewelry," the brand added. "Regarding Gabrielle Chanel, he said, 'My job is not to do what she did, but what she would have done. The good thing about Chanel is it is an idea you can adapt to many things.'" Chanel also lauded Lagerfeld's talents as a photographer and director, noting his work for the label's imagery, short films, and more. He had been behind the lens for the brand's fashion campaigns since 1987.  "Finally, one cannot refer to Karl Lagerfeld without mentioning his innate sense of repartee and self-mockery," the brand continued.    It is with deep sadness that the House of CHANEL announces the passing of Karl Lagerfeld, the Creative Director for the CHANEL Fashion House since 1983.

The House of CHANEL benefited from his talent for all the branding campaigns related to Fashion since 1987.

Alain Wertheimer, CEO of CHANEL, said: ‚ÄúThanks to his creative genius, generosity and exceptional intuition, Karl Lagerfeld was ahead of his time, which widely contributed to the House of CHANEL‚Äôs success throughout the world. Today, not only have I lost a friend, but we have all lost an extraordinary creative mind to whom I gave carte blanche in the early 1980s to reinvent the brand.‚Äù Bruno Pavlovsky, President of Fashion at CHANEL, said: ‚ÄúFashion show after fashion show, collection after collection, Karl Lagerfeld left his mark on the legend of Gabrielle Chanel and the history of the House of CHANEL. He steadfastly promoted the talent and expertise of CHANEL‚Äôs ateliers and M√©tiers d‚ÄôArt, allowing this exceptional know-how to shine throughout the world.

Both brands also responded to the designer's passing with heartfelt statements online.  Fendi wrote:    Thank you Karl for the most beautiful journey With all our love Your Fendi family A post shared by  Fendi (@fendi) on Feb 19, 2019 at 4:51am PST  And the Lagerfeld line wrote:   The House of KARL LAGERFELD shares, with deep emotion and sadness, the passing of its creative director, Karl Lagerfeld, on February 19, 2019, in Paris, France. He was one of the most influential and celebrated designers of the 21st century and an iconic, universal symbol of style.

 "Never again." Tonight, 14-year-old Millie Bobby Brown took the stage at the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice awards wearing custom Calvin Klein. But the actress, who appears in the label's newest campaign, wasn't wearing just any custom design: The Stranger Things star wore a jean jacket bearing the words "March for Our Lives" and the names of the 17 victims of the Parkland shooting. The front had the words "never again" stitched above a pocket. After the show, she posted a photo of her jacket on Instagram, thanking Calvin Klein for supporting her and championing this cause.

 The store design is inspired by the fashion house's Cruise 2017/2018 runway.  Chanel is known for its over-the-top runway sets and now, the fashion house is bringing one of its most intricate of the year to real-life inside Nordstrom.  Just in time for the holiday season, the brand is launching a pop-up shop at Nordstrom Seattle inspired by its Cruise 2017 show, which took place back in May at the Grand Palais in Paris.  Like the brand's Cruise 2017 collection and runway design, the Chanel x Nordstrom boutique pays homage to ancient Greek architecture. While life-like stone columns were used on the Chanel runway, the pop-up shop instead features metal wire columns done in gold and rose gold, putting a modernized spin on the references to Greece.    Featuring a mix of ready-to-wear, handbags, and accessories (like those knee-high gladiator sandals spotted on the runway), the store offers a curated selection of the brand's latest cruise collection.  The Chanel x Nordstrom pop-up store will be open to the public from November 29th to December 10th at Nordstrom Seattle.

 In a profession that traditionally shuns women, this chef has proven herself ‚Äî one roll at a time.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. Historically, women have been barred from becoming sushi chefs. Why? The myth is that a woman's period affects her body temperature and sense of smell, rendering her unable to properly handle fish (yeah, really). Needless to say, Oona Tempest is not your typical sushi chef. As a 25-year-old woman and head chef for Sushi by Bae in downtown Manhattan, she's one of the youngest sushi chefs in New York City‚Äîand one of just a handful of women in this male-dominated field. Her road to the top has not been easy, but in a tradition long reserved for men, Oona has persevered in the face of sexism and gender stereotyping. Tempest committed her life to sushi when she began an all-consuming apprenticeship with her master years ago. In the time since, she's perfected her craft and established herself as a true artisan. "I love making art and I love taking care of people; this craft allows me to do both of those things at once," she says. "While it may be difficult, I go home at the end of the day feeling like this is mine, I earned this." Watch this inspiring video to learn more about Tempest's story and see her culinary skills in motion. This is the fourth episode of One Woman, a video series by THINX and Harper's Bazaar that profiles the endurance and adaptability of everyday women.

 The tips and tricks to shopping like the soon-to-be Duchess. Meghan Markle's streamlined, classic and borderline rule-breaking street style has captivated us since she and Harry first stepped out together‚Äìand interest in the contents of her closet have continued to rise since the two announced their plans to marry on May 19th.  But where does Markle‚Äìor rather her stylist, Jessica Mulroney‚Äìshop? Markle has become a pro at mixing high street with high-fashion; the soon-to-be-Duchess manages to effortlessly enchant in Haute Couture one moment, and then stun on the street in a put-together pencil skirt and mock-necked knit the next. Apparently, her go-to for most of her accessibly-priced pieces is none other than one of our favorite spots to snag well-made, chic and easily transitional basics‚ÄìAritzia. According to the brand's site, Aritzia is "about individual style...obsessed with quality. And we think shopping should be fun." The brand caps off their mantra with a warm, welcoming "it's nice to meet you." Founded in 1984 in Vancouver, Aritzia was established to offer beautiful, well-made clothes partnered with great service. They retail a series of brands, all exlcusive to them, that live well together but vary slightly from one another. Markle's favorites, it appears, are Wilfred and Babaton, the higher-end brands of the Aritzia bunch. Wilfred aims at a "refined yet undone look" paired with elements of romance. Babaton, on the flip side, is all about minimalism‚Äìideal for workwear, it's all about precise tailoring. Markle donned the Wilfred Beaune Dress to last summer's Invictus Games in Toronto, and she has sported the Babaton Amos Dress Belt twice. She also wore the Babaton Lawson Trench Coat to the Invictus Games team trials this past Friday. Given the ease in which Markle has paired, styled and mixed and matched this brand with other elements in her closet, we wouldn't be surprised if Aritzia is Markle's answer to the Duchess of Cambridge's affinity for L.K. Bennett, an quality yet accessibly-priced brand based out of the United Kingdom Kate has long shown an affinity for.  Garden florals with elegant, classic courts // HRH The Duchess of Cambridge wore Fern Courts in Trench on a visit to the Kensington Palace memorial garden today üåπ #HRH #DuchessofCambridge #lkbennett A post shared by  L.K.Bennett (@lkbennettlondon) on Aug 30, 2017 at 1:16pm PDT From our experience, Aritzia's founding ethos still rings true. Walk into any of their stores and expect compliments on your outfit and personal assistance/styling from their friendly sales associates. Your salesperson will work with you throughout your time browsing the racks, while you're trying things on and up until they ring you up. They even tend to stick a few extra things in your fitting room they think you might like based on your preferences‚Äìquite the high-touch add-on to a fast-fashion experience. It's no surprise that their pieces speak to Markle, who seems to be balancing her affinity for simple, clean lines and body-conscious silhouettes with her new role as a royal. Markle's love for Aritzia's easy dresses, jackets and accessories are a welcome style reminder that one does not need to break the bank to look well-styled and polished. Want more royals? Now you can watch all of the best episodes from Bazaar's Royal Watch‚Äîright here on Prime Video.
 Proenza for less? Sign us up! Proenza Schouler fans get excited‚Äîstarting today, one of our favorite New York brands is launching a lower-priced line, Proenza Schouler White Label, or PSWL as it will be called. This extension will expand upon the brand's highly coveted tees, sweatshirts, denim and light outerwear. "It has always been a goal of ours to fully develop a well-rounded and balanced collection that mixes the high-end with the everyday in a way that speaks to both many of our personal friends, and to the designer customer we‚Äôve developed over the years. A more casual lifestyle has always been true to who we are as individuals, and true of many women in our lives, " designers Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez said in an official statement. And to help launch this new chapter, the duo tapped their close friend and loyal fan, Chloe Sevigny to model some of PSWL's key pieces. The line will range in price from $195 to $1,195 and is available starting today on proenzaschouler.com.
 The brand extension is perfect ‚Äî and so adorable. Since debuting its first collection four years ago, Brock Collection has quickly grown into one of the most coveted women's brands on the scene, and now it's about to add tiny trendsetters to its ever-growing fan base.  Drawing inspiration from its hugely successful Spring 2018 Ready-To-Wear collection, the label will team up exclusively with online children's boutique Maisonette for a limited-edition capsule collection for little ones. The LA-based brand is known for its signature modern romantic styles and has been worn by a slew of celebrities, such as Margot Robbie, Selena Gomez, Emily Ratajkowski, and Kate Bosworth. The CFDA award-winning label is typified by timeless florals, billowy silhouettes, and artistic vintage embroidery‚Äîstyles that prove both soft and feminine, but still on-trend. In the vein of Brock's already-youthful spirit, the Maisonette collaboration and line extension makes perfect sense.   Our most favorite collection yet! #BrockBaby for Maisonette. Could not be prouder to partner with @maisonette for this limited edition release! Link in bio to shop the collection. A post shared by  B R O C K  C O L L E C T I O N (@brockcollection) on Feb 12, 2018 at 12:52pm PST Co-founder Laura Vassar Brock explained to The Hollywood Reporter that it felt like a match made in heaven when Maisonette co-founders Sylvana Ward Durrett and Luisana Mendoza Roccia approached the designers about a potential partnership. ‚ÄúIt has always been a dream of ours to create a children‚Äôs collection," Laura told THR. "When Sylvana came to us with the idea of a collaboration, we were thrilled." The upcoming range will feature six ultra-soft cotton kidswear pieces: two shirts, two trousers, and two dresses, ranging from $95 to $175. If the upcoming collection seems reminiscent of the adorable co-ord sets and precious pastel jumpers worn by the world's best-dressed royal toddlers, you're right on the money. "The cream linen trouser and blue floral top would be heaven on Prince George ‚Äî the set is timeless and classic, and perfect for Easter," Ward Durrett told THR. Kristopher Brock‚ÄîLaura's husband and co-designer‚Äîadded that the line will focus on balancing early sartorial expression, and of course, comfortability. "We want the pieces to work for all children ‚Äî they really do start developing their own style at a young age ‚Äî we see it with our own son, it‚Äôs so fun," he explained. "We wanted this collection to be fun and easy."   The decision to move into the children's clothing market proves not only cute and creatively fulfilling, but strategic for business as well. ‚ÄúThe children's market is crucial right now,‚Äù Maisonette's Mendoza Roccia explained to THR. ‚ÄúMoms are starting families later in life, and spending more on their children than ever before.‚Äù Suffice it to say, it's our guess that the #BrockBaby collection will be a rapid sell-out. 
 From Maya Angelou to Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the exhibition features colorful paintings of 37 inspiring women.  Diane von Furstenberg has always been a beacon of female empowerment in the fashion industry.  This International Women's Day, the designer merged the fashion and art communities together by tapping artist Ashley Longshore for a pop-up exhibition paying homage to a series of female trailblazers.  Featuring a mix of 37 inspiring women, the exhibit is filled with colorful paintings that celebrate influential women over the years. The idea came about when von Furstenberg and Longshore first met over afternoon tea in London this past fall. From there, Longshore had just two weeks to complete the entire series of paintings. Hanging amongst the powerful room of women are portraits of Michelle Obama, Beyonc√©, Cleopatra, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Lady Gaga, Barbra Streisand, Jacqueline Kennedy, Frida Kahlo, Diana Ross, Malala Yousafzai, and Oprah.    "In my initial meeting with Diane, she mentioned a couple of names to me; Hedy Lamar being one, Michelle Obama another," Longshore tells BAZAAR.com. "Through our continued communication and late night emailing, Diane compiled an amazing list of women and I added a few of my own. Once you start researching amazing women you can just keep going ‚Ä¶ there have been so many fearless women throughout history and they all need to be celebrated! It was really hard, but time would only allow me to paint all 37 in only two weeks."   And of course, a portrait of Diane herself is included in the exhibition. It's the first painting Longshore made for the series, and it's particularly special to the artist. "I was really diving into her spirit and everything that has made her the woman that she is," Longshore says. "This painting is actually 14 paintings in one. I started with her spirit and then I built around that. The rest just fell into place."  Maya Angelou, Cher, Mother Teresa, Elizabeth Taylor, Rosa Parks, and Barbie share wall space in another corner of the exhibit.  And Josephine Baker, Peggy Guggenheim, Marlene Dietrich, Jane Goodall, and Wonder Woman are included in the curated series as well.  The DVF x Ashley Longshore exhibit is located at Diane von Furstenberg‚Äôs flagship store on 874 Washington Street, where it will remain on display through May 2019. The paintings will also be available for purchase. 
 The sexy Italian brand celebrates their latest ready-to-wear collection.  Last night La Perla brought their latest ready-to-wear collection to New York. Taking over the not-yet-opened Lobster Club in midtown, the Italian brand known for their luxe lingerie made a case for women looking sexy and comfortable in glittering cocktail dresses or a slim-fitting jumpsuit. Amongst a small crowd of editors and famous friends like Gwyneth Paltrow and Jessica Seinfeld, La Perla creative director Julia Haart shared her vision for the brand, "everything I make you have to look beautiful, sensual and comfortable."

 Will someone please cast the Hadid sisters in the remake already?  After months of wearing ultra-small, '90s-inspired sunglasses, Bella and Gigi Hadid are really committing to the full Matrix look now. Last week, Gigi and boyfriend Zayn Malik stepped out in matching outfits inspired by the sci-fi film and today, Bella joined in on the look with a take of her own.  While attending Men's Fashion Week in Paris, Bella opted for all-black attire with a sweeping, floor-length patent jacket, tiny lensed sunglasses, and oversized hoop earrings. To top the look off, she wore the sexiest pair of lace-up patent boots by Italian brand Liudmila.  The boots, which retail for $1,160, have become a new favorite of the model, who's worn them several times in the past month with everything from a red sequin dress to wide-leg pants. As for channeling The Matrix, the styling key to both Hadid looks is the black, full-length PVC trench jacket. The patent trench reigns as one of spring's hottest outerwear trends, and has already been spotted on the runways, the street style scene, and some of the best model off-duty style in the past few months.  And if you really want to take the outerwear look all the way back to the '90s, a pair of tiny lens sunglasses is, of course, essential. Gigi opted for a pair of mirrored Gentle Monster sunglasses for her look.  Coincidentally, THR reported a reboot of the 1999 sci-fi film is currently in the works and even more coincidentally, Warner Bros. hasn't yet announced who will star in the upcoming sequel movie. Here's to hoping both Gigi and Bella land the lead roles.   
 This is her first time back on the runway since 2016. Kendall Jenner has made her return to the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show. The model and reality star strutted on the VS runway in New York City this evening, wearing black lacy lingerie with a sequined black sheer turtleneck top and embellished black booties. Her "wings" were a fan of thin black feathers embellished with stars.   And in another look, Jenner wore punk-inspired plaid ensemble with mixed red fabrics and a flowy skirt.  Kendall's younger sister Kylie Jenner already gave us a sneak peek of her walk on her Instagram story earlier this evening. The beauty mogul shared a series of photos of her sibling hitting the catwalk with the caption, "I mean???" Kylie is me pic.twitter.com/pH7HIl6o61 When one fan fawned over Kylie "being obsessed" with her sister, Kendall tweeted back, "I‚Äôm more obsessed with her."  i‚Äôm more obsessed with her https://t.co/RrLt8xV3vi  The model also celebrated her walk on Twitter.

Although Kendall didn't make a grand announcement ahead of this year's show, she dropped a major hint on Halloween when she and the rest of her Kardashian and Jenner sisters dressed up as VS Angels for the holiday. They even used real outfits from previous runway shows.  ‚ÄúI did [get my practice in]," Kendall told People. "I actually didn‚Äôt even think of it like that until I got into the outfit and I was like, ‚ÄòOh wow, this was good.'

 These four influencers rely on emerging designers, sustainable labels, and an iconic French fashion house to come up with killer outfits you'll want to re-create. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. For the latest episode of This Look is Money, we ventured around Soho, an iconic New York City neighborhood, with four of our favorite YouTubers and style bloggers to find out how they stay chic in the NYC summer heat. Who are they wearing? How much did it cost? What things were they gifted? Think: something old, something new, something borrowed, and something bought resale. Prepare yourself for some major fashion inspiration.   YouTuber and entrepreneur Ashley Brooke rarely splurges on shoes. However, when she laid her eyes upon a chunky pair of white Chanel dad sneakers, Brooke knew she needed to add the kicks to her wardrobe full of "girly and edgy" pieces. "Living in New York City, I feel like white sneakers are so practical. They're so comfortable; they protect your feet. I thought that a good investment in a white sneaker was perfect. It was a smart choice for me, so I decided to splurge on those," she says of her $1,000 purchase.  The rest of her outfit is made up of more affordable pieces including a sheer black dress from Urban Outfitters ($59) with a black leotard underneath that she picked up for $15 on Amazon. The latter is a fashion must-have for Brooke,  as she often finds herself wearing the leotard while hitting the gym and walking her dog, Stella. Like most fashion girls, Brooke has an affinity for Chanel, which is why she also splurged on a black quilted leather Chanel camera bag with gold hardware from a vintage store in the Hamptons ($2,900). "It has a gold strap attached to it, but I thought I had a lot of gold going on, so I tucked in the strap and I'm just carrying it as a clutch," she says. "I also love that it has a little tassel detail on the side, it's kinda fun." She also layered three delicate gold necklaces that range from a $50 vintage store find in Brooklyn to a bar necklace with her initials on it for $90. "My sisters and I all have matching ones," Brooke says of her "A" necklace. "I live so far from home [Texas], so when I wear this, it really makes me feel more connected to them." She also wore three rings, including one from Etsy with her fianc√©e's name (Ryan) engraved on it ($40), and an everyday ring from By Alona ($79). Fashion blogger Opal Stewart likes sporting a mix of well-known designers and emerging labels to create outfits that embody her "chic, feminine, and a little edgy" sense of style.  She went for blue and green marble-printed heels from Paul Smith ($500), which add a pop of color to her white wide-legged trousers from Floriane Fosso ($400). The sustainable designer upcycles high-end fabrics and makes each new piece in small batches. Stewart also threw on an edgy chain-link belt that she scored on eBay ($30). The green Pinko top with lace detailing and yellow ribbon accents ($320) that she tucked in her pants was a purchase from Bloomingdale's. For a menswear-inspired touch, Stewart layered a multicolored houndstooth vest that she borrowed from Beatrice .b Italia ($600). She's also carrying a black leather shoulder bag by Lovard ($500) with a snake hardware accent. Stewart also likes to mix high and low when it comes to her jewelry. She's wearing a gold chain-link necklace from Tara ($1,500) layered with a nameplate necklace gifted by her sister ($50). The fashion blogger completes her look with an opal stone ring that she received from her boyfriend ($150).   When Katy Bellotte finds something she loves, then she will likely buy it multiple times, and her metallic gold Lulus sandals are no exception. The YouTuber, blogger, podcaster, and social media coordinator at L'Or√©al Paris owns six pairs of the affordable find ($30).  Bellotte is rocking a sheer black dress with a mauve floral motif and metallic gold polka dots throughout from Australian label Thurley. The maxi frock was originally out of her budget, but when the price finally dropped to $300, Bellotte pulled the trigger and purchased her "ultimate princess dress." Warmer weather calls for lightweight fabrics, and that style principle extends to her taste in accessories. Bellotte is carrying a circular rattan bag from Zara ($50) and a pair of small hoop earrings with dangling heart accents from Tess and Tricia ($55). Her delicate necklace, meanwhile, was a gift from jewelry brand Argento Vivo. Additionally, Bellotte isn't afraid to mix affordable jewels with big splurges. Case in point: a rose gold ring with a .6-carat diamond at the center ($3,000) from NYC-based jeweler Eli David Designs. "As a fashion influencer, there's a lot of pressure to have new clothes, [the] latest styles, [and] wear something different every post," she says. "I'm one of those people that when I [find] an outfit that makes me feel confident, I will wear that three times a week, four times a week. I think I'm a better person when I like my outfit."   For actress, producer, and blogger Lynn Kim Do, fashion is a way for her to express herself creatively. "I believe in each piece really being an expression of who I am," she says. "So I really choose designers that I either I really vibe with, are sustainable, functional or something even political sometimes." To achieve her "streetwear chic" fashion sensibility, Do relies on sustainable brands and vintage shopping. Her black Marimekko jumpsuit is rendered in large white floral prints ($495) and is cuffed at the ankles. For footwear, she opted for a pair of black kitten heel strappy sandals from COS ($150). She accessorized her look with a white leather newsboy cap from Clyde ($200) and a pair of oversized earrings from New York-based design duo Jill Martinelli and Sabine Le Guyader of Lady Grey. Do also added a couple of rings that range from $60 to $300 a piece. "This bag is great because it really injects my streetwear aesthetic, and I think a big part of streetwear is definitely being able to combine two really cool ideas," Do says of her black MCM cross-body bag.

 You can control the boot temperature through an app on your phone.  Buying snow boots can sometimes feel like a chore, but Jimmy Choo is about to change the game this winter. Paving the way in the world of tech footwear, the luxury shoe brand just debuted smart boots that are both chic and heated, so now you can actually be excited about buying the winter staple.   The smart genius cold-weather boots feature heated insole technology that keep your feet warm in the snow, rain, and coldest of temperatures. You can control and adjust the temperature of the boots (which ranges from 77¬∞F to 113¬∞F) through an app on your phone, which is a major game-changer for all our winter commutes. The boot's heating power lasts up to 8 hours and can be recharged through a hidden USB port underneath the back collar. Currently available for pre-order, Jimmy Choo's Voyager boots are available in both men's and women's styles in three different colorways. Despite the boot's wearable technology, the design is surprisingly anything but clunky and reportedly lightweight too.  The boots feature traction soles and are made of water resistant materials, meaning you can wear them as your snow or rain boots. And thanks to the chic design (ahem, hello to this white pair that I need in my life), you don't even have to change out of them after your morning commute.  While we've become inundated with smart watches over the last few years, it looks like it's finally time to make way for smart boots. And we're so ready. Consider this another item on our holiday wishlist this year. 
 The legendary designer was best known for his work with Audrey Hepburn.  Hubert de Givenchy, founder of the house of Givenchy, passed away on Saturday at the age of 91 years old. His family confirmed the news this morning.  The designer worked for Pierre Balmain, Christian Dior and Elsa Schiaparelli before founding his own fashion house in 1952. Soon after starting his own label, he met Audrey Hepburn, who became his lifelong muse and shaped the future of Givenchy's fashion legacy.  Givenchy famously designed the famous little black dress Hepburn wore in the opening scene of Breakfast at Tiffany's and also created looked for her roles in Funny Face and Sabrina‚Äîpaving the way for future designers' role in cinematic fashion.  Throughout his career, the designer went on to dress a string of elegant, esteemed women including Jacqueline Kennedy, Grace Kelly, Greta Garbo and more.  After debuting his first couture collection in 1952, Givenchy launched a ready-to-wear label just two years later and then a menswear collection in 1969. The French designer's work was marked by its Parisian elegance and sophistication that saw its impact in the cinema, on the red carpet, and on the chicest of women.   Givenchy stepped down as the head of design in 1995. Since his departure from the fashion house, an array of designers have taken reins of the label, including Alexander McQueen, John Galliano, Riccardo Tisci and, currently, Clare Waight Keller, the house's first female creative director.
 The model made history during Paris Fashion Week.  With the final show at Paris Fashion Week on Tuesday, Louis Vuitton made a stride in diversifying its runway by casting a black model to open its show for the first time ever. Janaye Furman became the first black woman to open for Louis Vuitton in the fashion house's 163-year history, marking a historic moment on the Parisian runway.  Furman took to Instagram to write about the experience, "This is such an incredible and unbelievable moment! Not only for my first opening show to be Louis Vuitton but to make history as the first African American girl to open LV?!"  Not only was it the model's first time opening Vuitton, but it was her first time opening any runway show.  "I'm so glad more women of color are rocking the runways. It's so important that we stand up for ourselves and make a difference in this world. I'm so happy I was able to tell this beautiful story. I mean look at that coat," she added.  Still, the progress toward diversity in fashion is moving way too slow. Here's hoping more women of color get the runway opportunities they deserve. 
 Why don't you just meet me in the midi? The middle tends to get a rap‚Äîalmost as if full potential has not yet been reached. But when it comes to the midi-length skirt, we find a fashion item that is fully realized. It's universally flattering, it can handle prints well, it can be worn to work or with a bathing suit, it can be done up in slinky silk or cozy knits. We love the midi and so do a host of other chic ladies. See who wears it well and shop their looks.  A basic slip skirt can go from an evening out with an equally slinky top, to work with a cozy knit. Just add boots.  Invest in classic colors like white and black. A beautiful printed skirt feels like a workwear staple but this blogger proves it's ideal for casual moments as well when paired with a graphic tee and lace up sandals.  A scarf print feels right on time. When it does come to workwear, a wrap midi in a silky fabric is an unexpected alternative to trousers. A button down and oversized blazer finish the look. This wrap skirt is seasonless and wear-forever. An animal print always feels on time. Go bold by mixing it with other prints, or keep your look more streamlined with easy black or white tanks and turtlenecks.  A snake print looks just as cool as zebra or leopard. We love this belted version. A leather midi is a little tough, very cool, and still somehow timeless. Flip flops make for a surprising counterpart to the wintery skirt.  This pencil skirt will take you miles. Try it with a plain tee, a silk button-down, a turtleneck sweater. The options are endless. The denim pencil skirt has made a sneaky comeback, and we're ready for it. We love this staple.  Perhaps you're more black denim than light, more white than black. Pick your shade and keep your skirt fitted and high on the waist. A great sarong skirt can go from the beach to the city with the switch of a bikini top. Opt for a bold hue to maintain the fun. This bright piece is just the thing to make you feel like you're on vacation, whether you actually are or not.
 Statement earrings are winning big so far.  Get ready to let your earrings do all the talking. As the Fall 2019 collections begin to make their way down the runways, one thing is already certain: the statement earring trend is about to reach new heights. From colorful crystals to bold mismatched earrings and over-the-top hoops, next season is making way for some major jewelry pieces. Check back as we spotlight all the best earrings, necklaces, and bracelets spotted on the runways in New York, London, Milan, and Paris. 
 Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery? From Mugler to Alaia and Versace, Kim Kardashian has been wearing a ton of archival designer looks lately (much to Fashion Nova's delight). One thing the outfits have in common? They were all worn by Naomi Campbell first in the '90s.  Instagram account Diet Prada called out Kim's channeling of the iconic supermodel in a series of outfit comparison photos. Most recently, she wore a vintage Versace slip dress to Chance the Rapper's wedding‚Äîthe same look that Naomi first debuted on the runway in 1996.    Hey Fashion Nova, here‚Äôs a tip... you can just go ahead and copy any 90s Versace Naomi wore instead of secretly collaborating with Kim lol. ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä ‚Ä¢ Via: Twitter (@ fuckrashida) Insta @rashidareneeward ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä ‚Ä¢ #naomicampbell #supermodel #versace #gianniversace #alaia #azzedineala√Øa #kimkardashian #90s #vintage #vintagedress #vintageversace #stylist #recreation #lace #glam #sparkle #leopard #animalprint #bodycon #reproduction #fashionnova #fastfashion #idea #bodysuit #catsuit #alaia #kardashian #kuwtk #ootd #wiwt #dietprada A post shared by  Diet Prada ‚Ñ¢ (@diet_prada) on Mar 12, 2019 at 12:41pm PDT  Just last week, the reality star had an Instagram photo shoot in a sexy leopard catsuit and beret by Ala√Øa. The sheer look was part of the designer's 1991 collection, which Naomi also coincidentally wore on the runway as well.  Keeping up with her vintage Versace streak, Kim has worn several '90s looks from the Italian fashion house that were first debuted by Naomi. In December, she donned a silver metallic gown from Versace's 1998 collection to the premiere of The Cher Show on Broadway. Naomi previously wore the look on the '98 runway and then again for a red carpet event in 2015.  And then there was this sparkling chainmail mini dress that both women also wore. Naomi donned the Versace look in 1997, and then Kim wore the outfit to attend Versace's runway show in 2018. To be fair, who wouldn't want to channel Naomi Campbell's iconic style? Especially when revisiting some of the greatest '90s fashion moments. No harm in recreating an icon's most legendary designer looks‚Äîso long as they don't end up on Fashion Nova.

 Who needs New York Fashion Week when you have the happiest place on Earth? Like many other brands, Opening Ceremony has been skipping a traditional runway show for the past few seasons. But now, the New York-based designers are going where no other fashion house has gone before: Disneyland. Posting a video montage starring none other than Mickey Mouse, the brand took to Instagram to reveal its next runway show will be held on March 7th at the happiest place on Earth. Notably, this will mark the first time that Disneyland's California location has hosted a fashion show in 40 years. Opening Ceremony has yet to reveal any more details about the show, but it will reportedly feature current season merchandise in a see-now, buy-now format.  Of course, the brand's decision to once again skip New York Fashion Week comes as no surprise. Founders Carol Lim and Humberto Leon have been experimenting with different fashion show formats over the past two years. The brand has staged a ballet performance show and a political pageant in lieu of a traditional runway show for some of its past few collections.  It's unclear whether Opening Ceremony's Disneyland show will be inspired by Disney characters (or perhaps even feature them as models on the runway), but either way, the show is guaranteed to bring a much-needed dose of fun into the traditional Fashion Month calendar. 
 Hey, hey, hippies. From the vastly different runways of R13, Prada, Proenza Schouler, Christian Dior, John Elliott, Collina Strada, and more, it seems the great fashion equalizer for the season is tie-dye. That hippie mainstay so beloved by the Woodstock generation has found favor amongst the social media set‚Äîall the more colorful thanks to Instagram, and all that. See who's wearing it and how, and of course, shop it! No complicated rubber-band ties necessary. The supermodel takes her tie-dye with some logo love‚Äîpairing a Polo tee with easy white trousers, sneakers and a coordinating Proenza Schouler tie-dye bag. Take tie-dye print on in hues that feel like a breath of fresh summer air‚Äîtied with a braided belt. This whole idea feels a little '90s to us in the best way‚Äîcasual sweatshirt, with denim cut-offs and a cross-body bag‚Äîconsider it your new summer weekend uniform. Prada killed the tie-dye game for the season, but this button-down comes out on top. We love it with the aforementioned denim shorts, but it would be very chic with a white pencil skirt or baggy jeans, too. A post shared by Melanie Huynh Utzmann (@melaniehuynh1) on Apr 26, 2019 at 8:39am PDT What's easier than an oversized button-down dress and slides? Nearly nothing, we'd say. This subdued pastel piece will bring you from beach cover-up to belted mini dress in no time flat. Why don't you double down on summer trends and take your bucket hat, tie-dyed? The A-lister takes the idea to evening with a Dior mini skirt, booties and a blazer. The whole look is grown up but still very cool. This easy-breezy slip dress has its head in the clouds and that's why we like it. This season-less piece reinforces Proenza Schouler's dedication to tiedye. We love this with Bermuda shorts for summer and trousers come fall. The Biebs loves a good tie dye moment, and why wouldn't he? This tie-dye swirl is on point and the pink and purple shades in this oversized shirt dress are too pretty to pass up. The effortless mix of cashmere and casual tie-dye is one great take on modern luxury.¬† A post shared by Shiona Turini (@shionat) on Oct 30, 2018 at 2:35pm PDT Shiona wears the hero tie-dye piece from Fall 2018‚ÄîProenza Schouler's velvet turtleneck‚Äîproof positive that this is no passing fad. This black and white version is super graphic, cool, and loses all associations with hippy culture‚Äîalmost. A great oversized tie-dye hoodie is basically a summer beach weekend pre-requisite. Make it count. We love the clever mix of long denim shorts, cropped hoodie, white socks, menswear-inspired shoes, and a cross-body bag. It may not be what you would wear but it's a refreshing reminder to make a trend feel like you. These colors remind us of a California sunset‚Äîa feeling we'd like to wear around with us all day long. This suit is inspired by Venice Beach in the '80s and we can't think of anything better. There is an inherent ease to the boiler suit. This one by Stella McCartney is the definition of one-and-done. Just add a great white bag. It's impactful, but definitely not a one time wear. Pair with white sneakers for day and swap for strappy sandals at night. Keep it cozy‚Äîand tie-dyed‚Äîin this ideal Saturday loungewear.¬† Paige shorts, $98, paige.com.
 So we meet again, True Religion.  In case their namedrop in the iconic 2005 Black Eyed Peas song, "My Humps" didn't make it evident enough, True Religion jeans ruled the early 2000s. Up there with Juicy Couture tracksuits, logo bags, and trucker hats, True Religions were the jeans to have. And now, over a decade later, Bella Hadid is spearheading their comeback. Or at least attempting to.  The model is the newest face of True Religion's Fall 2018 campaign, appearing topless in a pair of dark wash jeans complete with the the brand's signature horseshoe emblem pockets (and a hip chain belt, nonetheless). In the caption, she declares, "True Religion is back!"  Pump the brakes: are we actually about to enter the renaissance of True Religion? Given the return of several other early 2000s trends (ahem, the Dior saddle bag), it's not a completely outlandish suggestion. And let's be honest: if anyone were to make the throwback item cool again, it would be a Hadid.  Of course, given that Bella was under 10 years old during the early aughts, it's likely that she missed out on the trend the first time around. But let's not forget the many incredible celebrity ~fashun~ moments that did occur in True Religion... ...like early 2000s Queen, Paris Hilton: and The Newlyweds legend, Jessica Simpson: Not even Reba was safe from the Great True Religion Obsession of 2005: And for Hadid's collaboration with True Religion (oh yeah, in addition to the ad campaign, the model also has a new capsule collection with the brand), the 2000s staple bootcut jeans are included. Along with the nostalgic bootcut and flare styles, there are also three skinny jeans and a denim shirt included in the collection, which ranges from $40 - $300.  The limited-edition collection is available to shop now, if you're ready for a trip back to 2005, that is.  SHOP BELLA HADID x TRUE RELIGION NOW

The two play parents to a little girl hunting down the evil brother of Santa Claus in order to save Christmas.  ‚ÄúI love the film's over all empowering message.

 It's the end of an era. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. It's the end of an era for Topshop, the beloved European retail giant. The brand has announced it will shutter all of its U.S. Topshop and Topman locations, adding to the 200 U.K. stores that its parent company, Arcadia Group, has closed over the past three years.  According to the BBC, Topshop closing down its U.S. locations is a move pushed by Arcadia Group in the hopes that it will help prevent a "breakup" and avoid going into administration, meaning the company would be temporarily passed over to another individual who investigates the situation to see if the company can be rescued, or if it's time to throw in the towel.  The shakeup will likely put several jobs in jeopardy, the BBC reports. Ian Grabiner, chief executive of Arcadia Group, tells the BBC that the move was a "tough but necessary" one.

 Shop brands like Reformation and Doen along with your Prada, Givenchy, and more. Over the years, Net-a-Porter has become our go-to retailer for shopping our favorite luxury heritage brands like Gucci, Prada, Balenciaga, Saint Laurent, as well as the hottest contemporary brands such as 3.1 Phillip Lim, Acne and Zimmermann. But now, some of the coolest brands in the direct-to-consumer space have just became easier to shop all in one convenient place now that they've also been scooped up by the mega online retailer.  Today, Net-a-Porter announced a rolling drop of 7 direct-to-consumer brands with cult followings to come in the next few weeks: Reformation, Doen, Line By K (which launched in the last few weeks), Frankie Shop, Maison Cleo, Harmur and Art Dealer.  ‚ÄúWith a global audience of 2 million Instagram followers between them, these are the cult brands of the moment, who have a fiercely dedicated fan base. We are so excited to be able to offer our customers a way of being ‚Äòin‚Äô their close-knit communities," says the global buying director, Elizabeth von der Goltz. Just this week, the luxury retailer celebrated the launch of Doen and 15 exclusive pieces with co-founders Katherine and Margaret Kleveland during a dinner in Los Angeles. The brand has become a go-to for that laidback California, ultra feminine and luxe bohemian look. Their whimsical floral dresses and peter-pan collared tops are pieces you can throw on for any occasion.  
  Last week, Net-a-Porter also debuted Reformation on their site, the cult brand for cool girls everywhere from New York to Los Angeles. The eco-friendly label cuts sustainable fabrics into vintage-inspired effortless dresses that have garnered mega celebrity followings including Taylor Swift, Rihanna and Emily Ratajkowski.   Early in April, Line By K, a brand founded by former fashion blogger Karla Deras, also launched on the site. The capsule features elevated basics from bodysuits to silk skirts and slip dresses.   Expect much more to come from minimalist brand Frankie Shop (who boasts outposts in New York and Paris) starting May 20th, such as timeless pieces to satiate any minimalists wardrobe. Or if you're someone who's in the market for a standout summer look, Harmur's vintage silk halter tops and slip dresses could be your new go-to at the end of June. We're also partial to the mother-daughter duo at Maison Cleo who will launch seven exclusive styles with a French flair on June 17th. Last but not least is Art Dealer which will deliver a dose of their signature romantic and playful style to the Net-a-Porter customer come June 2019.   
 Get ready for one of the biggest runway events of the year. The Victoria‚Äôs Secret Fashion Show will be upon us before you know it. Here‚Äôs everything you need to know about this year's event.  The VSFS airs on Tuesday, November 28 at 10/9 central on CBS. Find out how to watch the show on your computer, phone, and more here. Shanghai, China. This marks the first time the fashion show will be held in the city. See the full model roster here. Balmain is creating custom looks for this year's VS show and collaborating with the lingerie line for a range to be sold in-store and online starting November 29. 
 In a new video from its Road to the Runway series, VS shares a closer look (but doesn‚Äôt give away) the Balmain collaboration and how it came to life. The result is a glam and couture take on punk-rock, with ultra-sexy ensembles featuring leather, studs, spikes, crystals, and sequins.  ‚ÄúWe believe in the same kind of woman, a powerful lady, a strong and confident, sexy girl that knows what she wants,‚Äù creative director Olivier Rousteing says of Victoria‚Äôs Secret and Balmain in the clip.‚Äú According to VS‚Äôs creative team, each piece is basically couture, with embroidered, encrusted, and bejeweled elements. The lingerie is also exposed, and the outfits are intended to be worn out for a steamy street style look. Lois Ribeiro, an Angel since 2015, will model this year‚Äôs most extravagant piece of lingerie on the VS runway. The bra, which costs $2 million, is covered in precious stones like handset diamonds, yellow sapphires, blue topaz, and 18 karat gold. It was designed by Mouawad, a Swiss and Emirati luxury accessories company. According to Victoria‚Äôs Secret‚Äôs Instagram, the Brazilian model has already been working the jewel-covered bra before taking to the runway.  In addition to the Fantasy Bra, this Swarovski crystal-covered look will also be adding some glitz to the runway. One standout ‚Äúanniversary piece‚Äù celebrates the jeweler‚Äôs 15-year anniversary partnering with Victoria‚Äôs secret, and consists of 275,000 multicolored crystals, 200 yards of ribbon, hand-beaded jewelry, and 14-pound wings. VS Angel Elsa Hosk will model the look with bright red undies, embellished sleeves, and feathered sandals.  According to VS, these are some of the heaviest wings they‚Äôve ever made. Considering Hosk‚Äôs hardcore workout routine, it seems like she‚Äôll be able to carry these heavy wardrobe pieces with ease.  Exclusive: The 2017 @victoriassecret fashion show is set to be an even shinier and more extravagant spectacle than ever before. Not only is the brand jet-setting to Shanghai for the show, but it‚Äôs also celebrating the 15-year ‚ÄúCrystal Anniversary‚Äù of its partnership with @swarovski. 275,000 crystals and 200 yards of woven ribbon and pav√© crystals will be worn down the runway by Angel @hoskelsa, with one million crystals taking the runway in total. Here, a behind-the-scenes look at her fitting #wwdfashion (üì∑: @clint_spaulding) A post shared by  WWD (@wwd) on Nov 13, 2017 at 8:04am PST Harry Styles, Miguel, Hamilton's Leslie Odom Jr., and Chinese pop star Jane Zhang will be performing at the VSFS this year. Despite earlier rumors, Katy Perry and Taylor Swift will not be making an appearance. Aside from the Fantasy Bra, Swarovski anniversary piece, and vague preview of the Balmain collection, the rest of the outfits have been kept tightly under wraps. We can't wait to see what they look like on the runway.  Watch this space for updates.

 Slay, Selena! Straight off of her New York Fashion Week date night with The Weeknd on Friday, Selena Gomez made her second stunning fashion week party appearance yesterday at the Business of Fashion's #BoF500 party.

 "I've always been really reckless," says Centineo. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. Noah Centineo is the new face (and body) of the latest #MyCalvins campaign. The breakout heartthrob from Netflix's To All the Boys I've Loved Before is fronting iconic American label Calvin Klein's latest campaign‚Äîalong with other rising stars‚Äîwith a series of imagery lensed by Mario Sorrenti and a 30-second visual helmed by Jonas Lindstroem.  The campaign, dubbed "I Speak My Truth in #MyCalvins," sees the South Florida native donning a white tank and matching boxer shorts while reflecting on his version of the truth regarding both physical and emotional scars. "I've always been really reckless," Centineo admits while sitting on the edge of a bed in a sepia-toned room. "If you ain't got no scars, [then] you good, you're really afraid, really cautious, or you're just really lucky."  Centineo had a scar on his chin since childhood, which he fully embraces. In the clip, he roams around the room, first laying down on the shaggy carpet before staring at his reflection in the bathroom mirror. Towards the end of this clip, Centineo gazes pensively at the camera while sitting at the kitchen table, casually flexing his muscles. "You can't really get rid of scars, especially if they're like emotional ones. I love my scars. All of them. I speak my truth in my Calvins," he adds.  Centineo has previously fronted campaigns for the American brand before, which has a reputation for turning ingenues into household names, including Kate Moss and Mark Wahlberg in the '90s. The global digital campaign drops today, May 9, and features ten other influencers and celebrities who represent the ethos of living a carefree lifestyle that occasionally bucks societal standards. Amongst the roster is one of fashion's favorite rappers, A$AP Rocky; models Bella Hadid and Kendall Jenner; musicians Shawn Mendes, Troye Sivan, Chika, and Billie Eilish; actors Indya Moore and  Yoo Ah-In; and BROCKHAMPTON's Kevin Abstract.  Watch the 53-second clip featuring the full roster of talent below. 
 
 The 48-year-old star is the newest Guess Girl. Jennifer Lopez is the newest face of Guess jeans. The brand made the announcement yesterday when it unveiled its new Spring 2018 campaign starring the multihyphenate star. J.Lo's sultry ads channel a pin-up retro feel, with a tied white shirt, thick belt, checkered mini skirt, stiletto pumps, and curls with a life of their own.  The mother of two has fronted countless brands through her career, from L'Or√©al to Louis Vuitton, but Guess hits close to home for the international star. "When I got the call from Paul Marciano asking me to become the new Guess Girl, I was thrilled and excited to be a part of such an iconic brand that I have loved since I was a teenager," she said in a statement. Lopez is the latest face of Guess, following budding stars like Camila Cabello, Hailey Baldwin, and Gigi Hadid. But at two years shy of 50 years old, J.Lo is proving Guess Girls‚Äîand It Girls‚Äîdon't have to be in their early 20s or younger. Said Guess co-founder Marciano, "Jennifer‚Äôs impact and influence continues to grow and this campaign celebrates the notion that women get more beautiful and talented as they gain life experience."
 The shoes you should have in your rotation for this season and the next.   The right high heel can put a pep in your step and lend you a boost of inner-confidence that can't be beat. But these days, a woman has more height options than a towering stiletto. Every season, a new heel type takes over and wedges (get it?) its way into our hearts and pockets. For a little refresher and style guide to all the classic heel types to know, keep scrolling (and shopping).  The stiletto heel, one of the most classic and popular heel styles, is named after the stiletto dagger, dating back to the 1930s. It's described by a long, thin heel‚Äîoften found on boots, pumps, and strappy sandals alike.  For a classic strappy stiletto that works for all your evening plans.¬† Not all stilettos are sky-high. These from Louise Et Cie are a bit easier to walk in, and perfectly work appropriate.¬† Once seen as a "grandma shoe," the kitten heel resurgence came about thanks to women demanding comfort over height. This heel height is no longer frumpy, but sexy. It comes in easy boots, naked sandals, and even flip flops.  For a vintage vibe and versatile pairings, this kitten heel adds a little unexpected texture to any look. Gucci's iteration of the trend features a 45mm heel and captures the collection's '80s vibes without being cheesy.¬† Wedges are a summer staple because they're usually done in espadrille or canvas. Originally created as an orthopedic shoe option in 1935, the wedge has since become a timeless wardrobe essential.  This vacation-ready wedge is crafted in a soft oat color, and has beige ties that wrap around the ankle and up the leg.¬† This version of the wedge heel is a bit higher, and contains a summer night metallic gold tone.¬† The block heel has risen in fame because of its walkability and versatility. Wear them to work, for happy hour, or a night out for the ultimate city stomping shoe. They're defined by the chunky, square shaped heel that can come in high and mid-height options.  These buttery patent leather sandals are an updated version of the block heel. Backless, sleek, and neutral.¬† This chic iteration from Gianvito Rossi comes in a nighttime-ready suede.¬† The beginnings of this classic shoe can be traced back to the first appearance of the iconic Chanel option. A slingback is defined by a strap that crosses behind the ankle or heel.  These luxurious slingbacks from Vince Camuto are a trendy must-have.¬† Made in Italy from soft black leather, these slingback pumps have an elegant pointed toe.¬† A mule speaks for itself; it simply has no back strap or support. They take practice to comfortably (and easily) walk in, but once you learn, you won't be able to stop wearing this endless trend.  These leather mules come in a feminine bubblegum pink; perfect for making any ensemble pop.¬† The leather woven mule is comfortable, right on-trend, and incredibly stylish.¬† In the '50s, ankle straps were a way for women to show off their romantic, feminine sides without being disrespectful. They hold the foot in easily while elongating the legs.  Not only are these heels affordable, they're known to be extremely comfortable, too.¬† The chic knotted details on this white leather shoe make them stand out even more.¬† Salvatore Ferragamo originally invented the flatform/platform sandal. Now, they come in chunky options and subtle versions that go with everyday aesthetics.  These platforms are anything but ordinary; they come in loafer form and include a massive chunky platform.¬† A sporty, sandal iteration on the flatform style.¬†
 The mother-daughter duo posed for Fendi.  Catherine Zeta Jones and her daughter, Carys Zeta Douglas, star in their debut photo shoot together. The pair were shot by Fendi as part of the brand's "Me and My Peekaboo" series that started last year, where every month they feature a different mother and daughter duo. The series celebrates the 10th anniversary of the Italian fashion house‚Äôs iconic Peekaboo bag. The episodes convey their unique bond with one another and show the timeless elegance of the Peekaboo Fendi bag between two different generations within a family.  Other notable celebrity families have also starred in the series, such as the Kardashians and the McGregor sisters along with various international families like Ikwa and Miki Tang. This episode marks the first time Zeta Jones and her daughter were shot together. The pair are documented elegantly dancing under the colonnade of historical Roman building Palazzo Altemps, and playing among the statues of Palazzo Della Civilt√† Italiana, the Fendi HQ in Rome.

 New York Fashion Week has never seen an ending quite as powerful as this.  After taking a one season hiatus, Rihanna made her return to New York Fashion Week tonight with a truly breathtaking and empowering presentation of her Savage x Fenty lingerie collection. The show, which was livestreamed on Youtube, is guaranteed to give you goosebumps and make your jaw drop. To put it lightly: RIHANNA REALLY DID THE DAMN THING.  Championing inclusivity and diversity, the moving presentation-turned-runway featured women of all races and body sizes. It was a show that celebrated women and sisterhood to the fullest extent with beautiful dance performances, symbolic choreography, and a theatrical display.  Yes, the runway spectacle featured appearances by Joan Smalls and both Hadid sisters, but the casting of models went well beyond that. When Rihanna launched her Savage x Fenty brand this past spring, she made sure the lingerie was made for women of all body types. That inclusivity was reflected on the runway of the brand's first presentation tonight‚Äîsomething many other fashion brands could benefit in learning from.  In an incredibly powerful moment, a pregnant Slick Woods walked the runway wearing sparkling black nipple pasties and a sexy cut-out bodysuit that showed off her baby bump.  She wasn't the only pregnant woman to walk the show either, another expecting model walked the runway in a plunging nude lace bodysuit. It was a casting choice that said pregnant women's bodies are beautiful and they're allowed to be sexy too. Taking her final bow at the end of the show, Bad Gal Riri wore a brown tube dress and matching headscarf, which she dramatically untied to reveal her face, as you do. While she walked down the runway, Elvis Presley's "Love Me Tender" played as all the models she walked past held hands in solidarity. It was perhaps the greatest ending New York Fashion Week has ever seen.  Watch Rihanna's full Savage x Fenty show (which starts at the 49:00 mark) below: The best part? The full collection is now available to shop online.  SHOP SAVAGE x FENTY BY RIHANNA NOW
 And Pete Davidson made his runway debut at the same show. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. Alexander Wang showed his new collection (dubbed Collection 1 2020) at the Rockefeller Center with a star-studded fashion show. Of the incredible location, which saw the runway set outside the iconic building, an Alexander Wang spokesperson told WWD, "we invite essentially New York City to come to experience the show on the upper plaza. As an American brand that is rooted in New York, Rockefeller Center represented the energy and the epicenter of New York City." Both Kendall Jenner and Kaia Gerber were dressed in white Alexander Wang looks, with matching white boots. The models also showcased identical wet-look hairstyles. Basically, they could almost be sisters: Ariana Grande's ex-fianc√© also hit the runway, and was seen hanging out with designer Wang before the show:  Per WWD, there was "an assortment of concession stands with snacks, treats, beverages and entertainment, as well as pedicabs," with Wang's spokesperson revealing, "We thought of this as a public moment as well so that anyone who comes to see the show will also experience something beyond seeing it from the upper plaza." The eclectic collection, which featured a lot of button-down coats and jackets for fall, also featured a model wearing a Statue of Liberty crown:

The Hotel de Poulpry, a 16th-century Parisian mansion, proved the perfect setting for Givenchy's fright house fashion extravaganza, thrown in celebration of the launch of Clare Waight Keller's ready-to-wear collections for the brand.

 Casual.  While some sports fanatics may wear their teams' gear or perhaps a pair of sneakers to attend a game, Kendall Jenner opted for a more high-fashion approach at a Los Angeles Clippers game on Saturday night.  The model turned the courtside into her own runway by wearing Saint Laurent's impossible-to-miss sparkling knee-high boots while cheering on her rumored boyfriend Blake Griffin during his game. And although some attendees may have been watching the actual basketball game (yawn), others had the right idea and instead were busy staring at Jenner's standout boots, which she happily showed off.  Giving us some The Devil Wears Prada vibes, she was all,"Are you wearing‚Äîthe sparkly Saint Laurent boots? Yeah, I am," from her courtside seat.    The head-turning-boots cost a cool $10,000 and are embellished with a subtle 6,000 rhinestones. But the model managed to make them a bit more casual by styling them with a pair of ripped blue jeans and an oversized turtleneck sweater.  Previously worn by Rihanna, Cardi B, and C√©line Dion, the disco-inspired boots first made their debut on Saint Laurent's Fall 2017 runway back in February. Proving the surprising versatility of the rhinestone-embellished boots, Bad Gal Riri and C√©line Dion wore them out and about on the street, while Cardi B wore hers to perform at the MTV VMA's over the summer.    Kendall's outing, however, marks the boots' first appearance at a sporting event. And while I'm no sports expert, I'm fairly certain that basketball could benefit from more sparkly footwear on the court.  Saint Laurent boots, $10,000, saksfifthavenue.com. SHOP
 The famous chef makes a foray into fashion with Moxie Made.  Celebrity chef, television personality, and best-selling author Rachael Ray is trying her hand at fashion with the launch of Moxie Made, an e-commerce site that highlights female-founded brands. Ray announced the digital market place at a celebration during South by Southwest (SXSW). In 2017 and 2018 she hosted a temporary pop-up called Moxie Shop during the SXSW season.  Model and designer Camila Alves, television host and interior designer Genevieve Gorder;  Alia Ahmed-Yahia of BAZAAR.com's Design Girlfriend series; Ray's stylist Cara Jammet; and bloggers Sara Escudero of Collage Vintage, and Courtney Kerr or Kerrently were in attendance to help fete Ray's new digital style endeavor. For Ray, the inclusion and promotion of inspirational women along with their unique perspectives inspired her new venture.  ‚ÄúI wanted Moxie Made to amplify the dynamic voices of women doing things differently while building a community that encourages and promotes curiosity, innovation, and the power of fashion's self-expression," Ray said in a statement. "The way you dress can make a statement about who you are, what you support, and the experiences you value.‚Äù The online marketplace carries designers from across the globe including Deepa Lakhani of jewelry brand Deepa Gurnani. Lakhani previously beaded couture pieces for Alexander McQueen, Emanuel Ungaro, Fendi, and Marjan Pejoski. Each item of jewelry from her line is handmade in India which "help[s] preserve an age-old beaded embroidery technique," according to the press release. ¬† 
  Kate Ciepluch of luxe t-shirt brand Banner Day is another designer available on Moxie Made.

 ‚ÄúMoxie Made has an authentic spirit that‚Äôs relevant to women today; it is exactly where retail should be, and as always Rachael is ahead of the game,‚Äù said brand ambassador Zanna Roberts Rassi of Marie Claire, Milk Makeup, and E!

 See the winning editorial of high-drama outerwear shot in Canadian ice caves. For the second year in a row, Harper's BAZAAR won the Lucie Award for Fashion Layout of the year at the Annual International Photography gala. BAZAAR is known for taking risks and pushing the boundaries with fashion photography, and the winning September issue story, "Deep Freeze," did just that. Photographed by Txema Yeste on the Blackcomb Glacier near Whistler, Canada‚Äîa location reachable only by helicopter‚Äìour team risked their lives to capture high-drama outerwear in ice caves on a melting glacier. The end result featured Aya Jones in looks from Marc Jacobs, Givenchy, Valentino, and more amongst the picturesque snowy landscape‚Äîbut the shots didn't come easily. After ferrying the crew to the location, a helicopter air-dropped the gear and clothing in for the shoot. Beforehand, all the fashion had to be carefully weighed‚Äîand a few items left behind to balance the load. As the shoot progressed, the crew could hear the glacier begin to crack and fall. Due to the dangerous conditions, a local expert went ahead of the team, poking holes to determine where it was safe to walk along the icy landscape. Despite the location's challenging conditions, the crew‚Äîequipment and fashion included‚Äîall made it back on the helicopter out by dusk. And with an award-winning fashion editorial to show for. 

 The 24-year-old Parisian actress waxes rhapsodic about life in NYC. I started acting when I was three years old in the living room of our family apartment; the sofas and the table were my set, the soft toys were my supporting actors, and my mother was the audience.  I spent hours lost in my imagination and when my mother would take me out and around Paris, my fast-moving childlike perspective would fuel my next narrative. I would take unsuspecting strangers and incidents home with me and inside my head; before sleep, I would concoct a new scene for the next day. Today, I‚Äôm twenty-four-years old and New York is my cherished playground of inspiration. Chanel top and skirt, Illesteva glasses  Bevza dress and jacket, Cartier necklace, Ben-Amun earrings "New York is my playground of inspiration."  Street photography in New York is a popular pastime, both in the past and the present. Hundreds of fingers press photography triggers every day as they hope to be the next Vivian Maier. Amongst the stolen moments and silent exchanges there is a lot to hear, and if we stop just for a moment ‚Ä¶ there are conversations to have and stories to learn, real ones. Some days the city is moving so fast it‚Äôs a whirlwind of anxiety and it makes Paris feel like a country town, but I wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way. Zac Posen top and skirt, Temps Des R√™ves scarf, Peracas Jewellery earrings  Being a French girl in New York has its moments of hilarity. I‚Äôve yet to find anyone who pronounces my name correctly the first time, but now I have a collection of cute nicknames.  "Being a French actress is full of ‚Äúwhat the fuck‚Äù moments." Auditions move as fast as the stock exchange, but to be honest, the romantic clich√© of being French is as charming as it has always been‚ÄîI wear my mariniere and my beret and search for an allusive terrasse to enjoy a glass of wine; at that moment, Paris doesn‚Äôt seem too far away   Saint Laurent by Anthony Vaccarello bodysuit, Wolford tights, Illesteva glasses, Ben-Amun earrings I guess my connection with the English language came from the freedom of it, just like when I was a child in my living room and I wasn‚Äôt overthinking about the lines or the meaning of the words. So far, New York has been wonderful, the generosity of the people here breathtaking and in every corner, I discover pockets of beauty.

 Major changes are afoot at the French fashion house.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. Per The New York Times, Lanvin's new creative director has finally been named after a period of uncertainty. Bruno Sialelli joins the brand from Spanish fashion house Loewe, where he served as the head of menswear, per WWD. Lanvin's relatively new owners, the Chinese company Fosun International, and its newly-appointed chief executive, Jean-Philippe Hecquet, made the announcement. In a statement (via The New York Times), Hecquet said it was Sialelli's "singular and very personal vision, his audacity, his culture, his energy and ability to build a strong creative team" that made him the perfect person for the coveted role.  Back in March 2018 it was announced that Olivier Lapidus was leaving Lanvin after less than a year as the brand's creative director. Then, in November 2018, it was revealed that Lucas Ossendrijver, Lanvin's menswear artistic director, was also leaving the company after 14 years. WWD claims that there could be further changes to come, suggesting that the house‚Äôs jewelry designer, Elie Top, could also be eyeing a move. SUBSCRIBE
 That's one way to cover your dirty laundry... It goes without saying that often we see items on the catwalk that are completely impractical to wear in real life. Gucci‚Äôs glitter mesh mask, YSL‚Äôs fully feathered dress, and well, most things Rei Kawakubo designs, are just a few examples. More often than not, one would assume that these less than wearable products are made for the theatrics of the catwalk and rarely go into production. However, Moschino seems to be disproving that theory, as it is currently selling a dry-cleaning bag dress for $733. Moschino dress, $733, brownsfashion.com. shop The transparent dress was a part of Moschino‚Äôs autumn/winter 2017 collection. On the catwalk, the dress (or ‚Äúsheer cape overlay‚Äù as it‚Äôs being described) was worn by Stella Maxwell over a black full-length gown. The item is currently on sale at Browns Fashion and is retailing for ¬£560 ($733). The website describes the garment as ‚Äúa slip-on sleeveless design made from a see-through polyester re-used plastic bag‚Äù and also notes that the dress should not be washed or dry cleaned. How's that for irony?

Emily Ratajkowski's unexpected style inspiration is none other than the impeccably-dressed Princess Diana. EmRata explained to Us Weekly that for the summertime, she is inspired by the '80s and Lady Di's sporty-chic off-duty looks. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to go ‚Äò80s and have been thinking about Princess Diana‚Äôs street and ready-to-wear moments like a blazer and a bike short and a big sneaker,‚Äù she told the magazine.      Like Lady Diana, EmRata seems to be a fan of the athleisure trend, however, the model prefers to add her own scantily-clad spin to the looks. Last summer, Ratajkowski was spotted in an army green sleeveless crop top, black biker shorts from Kith, Yeezy sneakers, and a crossbody bag from Laval.  Us Weekly also noted that the We Are Your Friends actress favors vintage earrings. For her outing, EmRata wore a chunky pair of gold-tone hoop earrings and a burgundy pair of sunglasses.   Princess Diana's gym-ready outfits skewed more casual yet still colorful. In one photo, she sported a periwinkle sweatshirt with yellow accents, coral biker shorts, chunky white sneakers, and a pair of high socks. She looked like she was on her way to a workout while her white towel flung over her left shoulder and her oversized tortoiseshell sunglasses framed her face. Ratajkowski also shared her three tips for vintage shopping: Pinterest (for inspiration), persistence, and tailoring. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all about patience and don‚Äôt be afraid to alter. If you see potential in something, do it,‚Äù she said.  She also touched on her killer date night style with her husband Sebastian Bear-McClard. (The pair celebrated their one year wedding anniversary in February).  ‚ÄúI like to wear an oversized jacket, a pair of Levi‚Äôs, one of my Inamorata tops, and a sneaker or boot and I feel good,‚Äù she added.  Summer officially starts on Friday, June 21, so both you and EmRata have time to get your best Princess Diana-inspired lewks ready for the 'gram.  Feast your eyes on Lady Di's killer outfits below for some major style inspiration. 

 Nothing says the holidays quite like lassoing a cactus in a denim corset.  This year's Love Advent calendar has mostly been a series of sexy and strong workout videos but for Day 20, Irina Shayk gives us all a break from the gym and saddles up instead.  Starring as a sexy cowgirl, the Victoria's Secret model wears a denim corset, cowboy hat, leather Coach holster, and sequin cowboy boots in the Wild West-themed video. Shayk shows off her insanely toned body while riding around on a toy horse and lassoing a man dressed up like a cactus, as any good cowboy does.  After capturing the cactus man (that's what we'll call him) and his cowboy friend, the model smacks her conquests around with the sunflowers she pulled from her gun holster. And while you've never seen a cowboy film quite like this, the video ends with Shayk riding off into the sunset on her horse as any good Western does.  This year's Love Advent calendar has so far included Ashley Graham, Gigi Hadid, Kendall Jenner, Winnie Harlow, Bella Hadid, and more, all starring in various exercise-inspired visuals. Though it's not entirely clear why Irina's Day 20 video veered from the #StayStrong theme, we're not exactly complaining about the model putting her own cowgirl twist on the series.

In this case, Millie, Paris, and Lulu all have ongoing ties to the brand and previously starred together in a music video for The xx in collaboration with Raf Simons.  Millie Bobby Brown for Calvin Klein  "The evolved #MYCALVINS concept has family at its center, a display of unity between strong individuals, further emphasized by the symbolism of the traditional American quilt.

 Author Robin Morgan converses with Dior creative director Maria Grazia Chiuri, while sisters May and Ruth Bell, and TK Wonder and Cipriana Quann explore The Sister Chapel, a monumental feminist work. It began with an e-mail from the House of Dior, from a stranger I‚Äôd read about: Maria Grazia Chiuri, the first woman to become creative director of that venerable French institution. She was writing to request my collaboration on feminist T-shirts for her Fall 2019 collection and invite me to her show in Paris. Being a creature of words, I‚Äôm grateful that the three anthologies I edited‚ÄîSisterhood Is Powerful, Sisterhood Is Global, and Sisterhood Is Forever‚Äîhad achieved cult status. But Dior T-shirts bearing their titles was something I never anticipated. Maria Grazia wrote that the Sisterhood Is Global Institute, the organization that Simone de Beauvoir and I cofounded in 1984, would receive a donation plus a percentage of the profit from each T-shirt sold. Feminists like ourselves‚Äîwho work with grassroots activists around the world on issues such as human trafficking and laws allowing forced and child marriage‚Äîspend sizable chunks of our lives fund-raising. So donation, you say? Percentage of each T-shirt sold? Incroyable! Off I went to Paris to meet my new friend.  Maria Grazia radiates Italian exuberance. Her laugh is infectious. She‚Äôs unpretentious and warm, with a sharp intelligence. She surrounds herself mostly with female colleagues, especially younger feminists, including her 22-year-old daughter, Rachele, whom she calls her muse. And she doesn‚Äôt just mentor these young women; she actively seeks out their advice and listens to it. Maria Grazia‚Äôs feminism is authentic, and she wants her work in fashion to reflect something greater than itself.    Ever since that first day we met in Paris, we have e-mailed each other or FaceTimed when schedules permit, and, as women do, we sometimes even send little presents. There‚Äôs affection, support, laughter. On October 22, Maria Grazia will come to New York to receive the Sisterhood Is Powerful Award for Wearable Media from the Women‚Äôs Media Center, cofounded by Jane Fonda, Gloria Steinem, and myself, at the annual Women‚Äôs Media Awards gala. So when Bazaar asked us to share parts of our conversation while Maria Grazia was briefly in Dallas with the traveling exhibition ‚ÄúDior: From Paris to the World,‚Äù we welcomed such elegant eavesdropping.  Sisterhood is very important. Together women can, as you‚Äôve written, make the world better. I was lucky to begin my career at Fendi, with the five women who built that company. There was teamwork, which gave me the idea that it‚Äôs possible for women to work together‚Äî Yes. There used to be this idea that women had to compete with other women for a man. Now women are more independent; they don‚Äôt need a man to support them.  I don‚Äôt think women experience power the same way as men. I‚Äôm 55, but want to hear different opinions, from women who are 22 and from women with more years and experience than me. I completely agree. Your books, and the work of other artists, helped me understand this concept because I never got to study such arguments in school. Nobody spoke to us about patriarchal power. I was proud that you consented to have your book titles on the T-shirts because it‚Äôs a way to promote these ideas.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think women experience power the same way as men.‚Äù  I think fashion can do a lot. Fashion is very popular, so it can help broadcast a message and reach a new generation.  Yes, because in the past women were unable to see themselves through their own eyes. When I started to work as a designer, the prevailing attitude was that fashion should tell women what they should wear. But I believe that women must develop their own personal style and realize everyone is different. Yes, it adds richness to life. We need to pay attention to what we do as an industry because we can send positive messages, but we can also send very bad ones. That we have to send a good message. Of course we have to acknowledge we are a luxury brand and that not all people can buy our products. But I was so happy after my first show when I did the we should all be feminists T-shirt and I saw fake T-shirts all around the world!  If someone sees your book titles on a T-shirt and then Googles and finds the books, that‚Äôs the goal for me. And, really, I can thank Dior for supporting me in this. Everyone seemed worried, ‚ÄúUh-oh, you are political.‚Äù But the company never stopped me. Everything is political anyway! Everything you buy, everything you eat. Life is political! There were people who didn‚Äôt believe a woman could be creative director at such a huge brand as Dior. Why is it so strange? Creativity has no gender. When I started to work in fashion, I never supposed this would be possible because as a woman you don‚Äôt believe in yourself. Absolutely. As women we are taught that we are supposed to take care of others, that it‚Äôs wrong to think about our own creativity. We all have to get such ideas out of our minds. It‚Äôs not easy, eh?  ‚ÄúFashion is very popular, so it can help broadcast a message and reach a new generation.‚Äù  And I want to thank you, Robin. You and all the women who support me in this project. This year was very intense. Honestly, I could never do this alone. Oh, I love, love pasta! And chocolate! I love sun, and I love sleep. One book that relaxes me a lot is Pride and Prejudice. I think I‚Äôve read it 10 times.  Me too, like you! That is sisterhood!   GET THE LATEST ISSUE OF BAZAAR

Candice Swanepoel shocked us all last year, just a few weeks after walking in the 2017 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show in Shanghai, she announced she was pregnant. Yes, as in, she walked the lingerie extravaganza while pregnant and we were none the wiser.  In June, she gave birth to her second son, Ariel, in Brazil. "One day I'll get to tell my son he opened up the Victoria Secret show in China," Swanepoel told Bazaar.    These are the most precious gifts life has given me. I am a lucky woman to be their mommy, to help guide them through this thing called life........ Now they will always have each other üíôAnacan & Arielüíô  #brothers A post shared by  Candice Swanepoel (@angelcandices) on Jun 24, 2018 at 2:05pm PDT Just a few months earlier, she also managed to launch her own swimsuit line, Tropic of C earlier this year. What can't this supermodel mom do?  Between being a mom and a CEO, it's amazing this Angel has time to fit in her workouts. "I work out a lot at home, just taking care of them is a workout. Yeah it's part of my job to take care of myself.  I have to kind of remind myself of that sometimes because as women we feel a little selfish to spend time on ourselves, even when its your job," Swanepoel says of her prep time leading up to this year's Victoria Secret Fashion Show.  For the first time in two years, the show returned to New York City where it all started. "I'm so happy to be back in New York, I feel like this show is always at it's best in New York City." She's also looking forward to her model bestie Behati Prinsloo returning to the catwalk as well. Much like Swanepoel, Behati also had two babies back to back with husband Adamn Levine‚Äîwhich meant she missed the VS show in Paris and Shanghai.  Luck for us, Swanepoel invited us for a behind-the-scenes look at one of her costumes for this year's show. "My first look is amazing, it's kind of simple but i love the simplicity of it. the wings are really elegant, very swan like which is very appropriate for me," Swanepoel told Bazaar while dressed in a much more modest look than last year's show.  This will be the Angel's 11th show with Victoria Secret, but she's still excited year after year. "I think my favorite part is being together will all the girls. You really appreciate girl time and being able to be with your friends and getting glammed up a lot more when you're a mommy." The Victoria's Secret Fashion Show will air on December 2nd at 10 PM on ABC.

 Maria Grazia Chiuri collaborated with several African artists on the "Common Ground" collection.  From Tokyo to Monaco and even Los Angeles, Dior is no stranger to a jet-set fashion show. But for its Resort 2020 collection, the French fashion house traveled to one of its most stunning locations yet: Marrakech.  Held in El Badi Palace, a historic palace dating back to the 16th century, Dior lit up its runway with hundreds of floating candles, fire pits, and a surprise performance by Diana Ross after the show.     The Moroccan city not only served as host to Dior's latest runway; its artists and culture helped inspire and create the collection. The theme was "Common Ground," which it sought to achieve through a series of collaborations with several African artists, offering a fresh point-of-view from the storied French fashion house. At a time when the fashion industry is increasingly being called out for cultural appropriation, it was a risky move‚Äîbut Maria Grazia Chiuri aimed for appreciation, not appropriation.  Common Ground: "Opinions or interests shared by each of two or more parties," as defined by the Oxford English Dictionary. Discover #DiorCommonGround on Monday, April 29th, for the unveiling of #MariaGraziaChiuri's #DiorCruise 2020 collection in Marrakesh. A post shared by  Dior Official (@dior) on Apr 28, 2019 at 10:00am PDT The artistic director tapped Anne Grosfilley, an anthropologist specializing in African textiles and fashion, to consult on the entire collection. Grosfilley helped source fabrics and reinterpret signature Dior motifs with Uniwax, a local manufacturer from Ivory Coast. Several pieces were done in 100% African Wax‚Äîmade from cottons grown, spun, and printed in Africa. Chiuri also enlisted Grace Wales Bonner (a British-Jamaican designer whose work explores a hybrid of European and African fashion) and Mickalene Thomas (a contemporary African-American artist) to reimagine Dior's iconic New Look silhouette.  Another collaborative piece from the 113-look collection was from Path√©'O, a South African tailor, who designed a shirt paying homage to the late Nelson Mandela. Sticking to her mission of empowering female artists, Chiuri enlisted Sumano, a Moroccan organization supporting local women artisans, to help create design details for the show. The local female artists also created the artisanal cushions which show attendees were seated on.  The artistic director also looked to French-Moroccan author Tahar Ben Jelloun's book, Racism Explained to My Daughter, for inspiration behind the concept of the show. An excerpt of the book reads, "Culture teaches us to live together, teaches us that we're not alone in the world, that other people have different traditions and ways of living that are just as valid as our own."  "Culture teaches us to live together, teaches us that we're not alone in the world, that other people have different traditions and ways of living that are just as valid as our own," writes Franco-Moroccan author Tahar Ben Jelloun in his book 'Racism Explained to My Daughter', Editions du Seuil, 1998, n.e., 2018. Tune in on Monday to watch the #DiorCruise 2020 show by #MariaGraziaChiuri in Marrakesh and discover more about the multicultural inspirations behind the collection!‚Å£‚†Ä #DiorCommonGround‚Å£ A post shared by  Dior Official (@dior) on Apr 28, 2019 at 6:09am PDT Through the various collaborations, Chiuri aimed to prove this was not a spectacle about exploiting Moroccan culture, but about celebrating it and bringing its artists' perspective to the historic fashion house.  Lupita Nyong'o, Shailene Woodley, Karlie Kloss, and Jessica Alba were amongst the A-listers in attendance at the destination runway show.  The show then concluded with a surprise performance by none other than Diana Ross. Wearing a sparkling silver gown, the icon performed several hits for the fashion crowd in attendance, which is how all runway shows should end, if you ask me.

 The newly renovated store is the stuff double C dreams are made of... What's better than a room full of Chanel? 14,000 square-feet and five floors of Chanel creations by Karl Lagerfeld‚Äîincluding ready-to-wear, handbags, shoes, costume jewelry and eyewear, watches and fine jewelry, fragrance, and beauty. After a two year renovation, the Parisian brand unveiled the newly designed 57th street boutique by architect Peter Marino‚Äîand it's the stuff of Chanel dreams. Take a tour of and see some of the exclusive products you can only find between Madison and 5th Avenue.  A wall of shoes and bags greet you upon entering...The finishes around the store include hand-applied matte wall finishes, handwoven tweed textiles and hammered bronze railings. The focal point of the space is an entwined 60-foot tall necklace sculpture that cascades down the center of the four-story central staircase, commissioned from the French artist Jean-Michel Othoniel.  The second floor is home to the shoe salon, with a custom Goossens chandelier. Here you can find all the classics‚Äîthe two-toned slingback, ballerina flat, beach espadrille and sneakers as well as bags including the 2.55, 11.12, Boy CHANEL, CHANEL‚Äôs Gabrielle and the newly introduced CHANEL 31 handbag, as well as costume jewelry and eyewear.  The boutique's opening corresponds with the arrival of the Cruise collection, which showed in Paris last May, when a larger-than-life cruise ship terminal was erected in the Grand Palais‚Äîwith a nautical inspired collection to match.  On the third floor, there's two salons that showcase ready to wear collections and and a dedicated space for knitwear.  There are two more ready to wear salons on the fourth floor. The word of the day here is, options.  Throughout the store, Peter Marino gives nods to Gabrielle Chanel and the codes of the house. Gold leaf and crackled lacquers as well as actual Coromandel screens can be found throughout the boutique and  reference the walls of Gabrielle Chanel‚Äôs apartment on rue Cambon in Paris.  The fifth floor feels like the chicest apartment in NYC and is reserved for VIP private shoppers.  Graphic artwork adorns the space, including works by Robert Mapplethorpe, two pieces from Olafur Eliasson‚Äôs ‚ÄúEighteen Moons in Penumbra‚Äù series, Jenny Holzer‚Äôs ‚ÄúI Touch Your Hair‚Äù, a piece by Peter Dayton, and several works by Y.Z. Kami, including a portrait of Gabrielle Chanel.  Of course, there are products you can only get on site, including a limited edition 2.55 handbag and wallet with sweet New York-inspired charms, and two one-of-a-kind  red or black alligator 11.12 handbags with diamond encrusted hardware. There is also a limited edition steel Code Coco watch with a diamond-set bezel and the launch of a new scent, Les Exclusifs de Chanel 1957, a layered musk fragrance, created by Chanel‚Äôs in-house perfumer Olivier Polge.
 In 2019, Logomania is here to stay, at least according to Kith and Versace. Streetwear giant, Kith, and iconic Italian design house, Versace, have selected model Bella Hadid as the new face of their upcoming collaboration‚Äîwhich features over 100 stunning pieces of women‚Äôs and men's ready-to-wear fashion, footwear, and accessories.    The just-released campaign showcases Bella in nine distinct outfits. The styling effortlessly plays off Kith's streetwear sensibilities, thanks to the sportier and baggier silhouettes, and Versace's maximalist approach to design, courtesy of ultra plush materials and the array of eye-catching prints the Italian brand is known for. In one shot, Bella sports a pair of black and gold biker shorts with a matching bikini top, styled with a chain necklace, and large hoop earrings featuring Versace's signature Medusa head. In another trendy look, she rocks a rich burgundy velour tracksuit that boasts blue and gold baroque print throughout, paired with a killer pair of high-heel mules.   While Versace's iconic Medusa head print is featured across the collection, this is the first time in the brand's storied history that the iconic emblem has been redesigned: it now features the Kith box logo across the eyes.  Kith's founder, Ronnie Fieg, shared his digital mood board for the collection online. It features a plethora of colorful imagery showcasing standout campaigns from the fashion house, with a bevy of '90s supermodels (Naomi, Christy, and Claudia, oh my!) along with the iconic designer Gianni Versace, and snapshots of both the original and recently reinterpreted Medusa logos. Each piece from the Kith x Versace collection is produced in Italy and is set to release on  Friday, February 15th at all Kith shops, at 11 AM EST on Kith.com, and at select international Versace flagship stores.

 See the top looks from the season's standout collections. As the Fall 2018 collections walk the runways in London, check back as we spotlight the top five looks from the season's standout collections. Here, the best looks from London Fashion Week. 
 Everything you need to know about the designers reportedly behind Meghan Markle's wedding gown. Buzz surrounding who will design Meghan Markle's wedding gown for the moment she walks down the aisle toward Prince Harry to become Britain's first American princess increases each day as we get closer to May 19, 2018. And this past weekend, reporters announced that Ralph & Russo, the design duo favored to be the atelier of Markle's choice, were indeed tasked with designing her royal wedding gown. 
  The label was in the running with some of British fashion's most notable names like Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen, Christopher Bailey for Burberry and Erdem Moralioglu for his namesake label, but Tamara Ralph and Michael Russo have remained the most mysterious of all the candidates in the mix. According to Town & Country, when asked to comment on designing for Meghan Markle's wedding day, a spokesperson from Ralph & Russo said, "we will be politely declining to comment on this topic." As we all know, discretion with royalty pays off, and it's highly likely that their Couture-under-the-radar vibes helped the house score the honor of appearing in Harry & Meghan's official engagement photos, and designing Meghan's bridal gown. Given that the duo tends to be a little more private than most, we (and the rest of the royal obsessed) are wondering, who are Ralph and Russo?  Tamara Ralph and Michael Russo are both Australian, and founded their label in 2007. Their atelier and label are based in London's elite Mayfair neighborhood, in a townhouse a stone's throw from the United Kingdom's best known fashion houses‚Äìlike Alexander McQueen, Vivienne Westwood, Roland Mouret and Jenny Packham‚Äìas well as Buckingham Palace. But, despite the competition, they are currently the only English label with true Couture status. Per Haute Couture regulations, design houses are evaluated based on their process, technical skill and structure and selected by the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture to show their collections in Paris in both January and July alongside labels like Dior, Chanel, Valentino and more.  While they show their collections alongside labels with storied brand heritages and decades of archives, the design house now employs more employees in their atelier than Chanel or Dior, Harper's BAZAAR UK reports. Said Russo of their decision to be based in London rather than Paris, "It‚Äôs a place to settle, as opposed to some of the other destinations for luxury...It‚Äôs where our clients buy property and send their children to school. It feels like the center of the universe." Ralph adds, "Ironically, accessibility is key. People want the exclusivity and the craftsmanship of Couture‚Äìbut they want it to be able to fit into their lifestyle." Tamara Ralph, who serves as the brand's Creative Director, oversees the atelier while Michael Russo handles the business side of the brand. The couple, partners in both life and in business, started their brand with just a few hundred pounds and a sewing machine. Ralph is a fourth-generation couturier, having spent much of her childhood in Sydney watching her grandmother and mother cutting patterns, sewing and designing. She was designing clothes for socialites in Australia and Europe as early as the age of 15, and she met Russo by happenstance on a short trip to London when she (literally) bumped into him on the King's Road. Of his chance meet cute with his wife turned business partner, Russo lovingly told BAZAAR UK, "She was lost and I was looking." Russo, then a financier, sent Ralph a one-way ticket to London, where they've lived and worked ever since. Since their launch, the company has scaled dramatically, with the duo being named two of Fortune magazine's 40 most successful business people under 40. The company is now posed to transition from a by-appointment Couture label to a global brand, with 17 stores opening worldwide, a ready-t0-wear collection and an accessories range. The brand has reportedly signed a lease for a Madison Avenue space in New York City, according to WWD. The two have designed for royalty, some of the world's wealthiest and affluent brides across the globe. Most of their recognizable wedding gowns are presented on their Couture runways rather than down aisles, and require teams of handlers to help the models pivot and turn given the weight of the embroidery on the gowns' trains and accompanying veils. But these designers are more about wearability than most‚Äìeven when it comes to their Couture creations. The brand's celebrity fans include Angelina Jolie, who has worn their designs on the red carpet and for her meeting with the Queen, Brie Larson, Bella Hadid, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jennifer Lopez, Kate Bosworth and‚Äìmost notably, Meghan Markle. In their interview with Harper's BAZAAR UK, the couple noted that despite their exclusive Haute Couture roots, their goal is accessible luxury.  "It‚Äôs about keeping our core values‚Äìthe femininity, the modernity, the creativity‚Äìand translating it into an accessible product," says Russo. "It‚Äôs also about taking away‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt want to use the phrase 'arrogant luxury' but we are all about being approachable. A lot of brands seem to enjoy putting a wall up between them and clients, but we want to be seen as available. Couture will always be at the heart of Ralph & Russo‚Äìbut now we are ready to reach a wider audience. Our ambitions really have no limits." Next stop? Aside from stores in key cities worldwide, red carpets and the closets of the fashion-obsessed and the global elite‚Äìthe royal wedding.
