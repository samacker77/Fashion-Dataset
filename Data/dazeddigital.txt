"Gareth Pugh already announced last month that he was returning to London to stage his first runway show in seven years, but there's more: he's also staging a retrospective to mark his label's tenth anniversary. There's even better news: the designer told WWD that his homecoming show will not be a one-off event – he intends to continue showing at London Fashion Week. The exhibition will take place at the Galeria Melissa Covent Garden and runs from February 11 through May. The plastic fantastic Brazilian shoewear brand has been longtime champions of the designer. Pugh has crafted several shoes for the label, and it is listed as head sponsor for his upcoming London show on February 21. Organisers said that the Galeria would ""embrace the key visual codes of Gareth Pugh’s conceptual design, in both the entrance and lower basement spaces"". Pugh has been showing in Paris for almost a decade now, but flew the nest with a presentation in New York last September. If his SS15 presentation in New York (LED screens! Contemporary dance! Video projections!) is anything to go by, visitors are in for an all-out sensory assault. ""I'm totally energized at the prospect of showing on home ground after seven years on the Paris schedule,"" he said of his upcoming show. ""London is where everything began for me - it's where I live and work and my entire creative family is here."" Watch footage from his SS15 presentation below: Liked this?

"Yorgos Lanthimos has gained a cult following for his unique and surrealistic take on the thriller genre. From the Killing of a Sacred Deer to The Lobster, the Greek director has become renowned for his ability to create bizarre worlds inside of his films. Applying his unique eye to the world of fashion by shooting Gucci’s Cruise 2020 look book earlier this summer, new images by the director have now been put together in a new art book for the Italian house titled Ωοτοκία. Shot at the Leda Gallery of Villa Albani Torlonia in Rome, models are captured posing among Ancient Roman and Greek sculptures. Elderly men and women with powdered white skin mimic the marble statues, while younger models are seen in Gucci’s colourful and eclectic outfits. “Having the actors and models interact with the environment, juxtaposed against these ancient sculptures and hundreds of years old walls felt very exhilarating,” Lanthimos explains. “The process seemed at the time like a rehearsal for a future play or the beginnings of a creation of a ritual that these people in the photographs would keep repeating for years to come.” Using a specific statue in the villa’s garden called Leda and the Swan, a first-century Roman copy of an earlier Greek statue from the fourth century, Alessandro Michele was inspired to create a shoot which explores, among other things, the importance of the value of the copy. With Lanthimos’ style being well suited to the otherworldly dreamscape that Michele has created around Gucci, the director said it was a “joy to be given the opportunity to create these images inspired by the work of Alessandro Michele.” Check out the book above and revisit Gucci’s SS20 show below.

"A lingerie advert featuring Ashley Graham, (the first plus-size model to cover Sports Illustrated), amongst other plus-size women for fashion label Lane Bryant has been banned by American TV networks for not complying with their advertising restrictions. Depicting body-positivity, with the women proudly showing off their shape and one model shown breast feeding, TMZ first reported that the 30-second clip would not be shown on air as it reportedly failed to meet NBC and ABC’s decency standards. However, NBC refuted the brand’s claims that the ad was dismissed altogether, saying in a statement, “as part of the normal advertising standards process, we reviewed a rough cut of the ad and asked for minor edits to comply with broadcast indecency guidelines. The ad was not rejected and we welcome the updated creative.” Lane Bryant responded by telling Cosmopolitan, “What is too much for some does not hold true for others. All women should be celebrated and feel empowered to express themselves as they see fit.” Whatever the outcome, the controversy around the advertisement only adds to the conversations surrounding body positivity and representation of non-skinny bodies in mainstream media, with social media campaigns such as #DropThePlus drawing attention to the body positive movement. But while more standardised depictions of female sexuality (and sexualisation) continue to penetrate every facet of society with very little questioning, it seems anything existing outside of the skinny norm still comes under strict scrutiny from consumers and corporations alike.

"With instant access to pretty much every TV programme and film ever made at any given moment, like most people, I’m not big into watching shows as they come out. That was until a few weeks ago, when I stumbled across Breaking Fashion on BBC iPlayer. With a mixture of behind-the-scenes footage and talking heads-style insights shot in spectacularly unflattering light, the documentary follows Salford-based fast fashion brand In The Style through its summer season. Viewers get to witness the brand churn out a new collection every two weeks – shipped from China at a mark up of around 70 per cent – over the course of three months in order to try and compete with its rivals, which include fellow north-west online retailer giants like Boohoo, Missguided, and Pretty Little Thing. It’s compelling TV, and I began watching it as soon as it was available each week without fail, reporting back to a group chat made up of people equally hooked and – significantly – appalled. Each episode follows a different influencer collaboration. In episode one, we see In The Style team up with Lorna Luxe. I wasn’t familiar with her before, but with over 900,000 followers on Instagram, it’s clear plenty of people are. She was considered a big score for a collaboration, particularly, as we hear approximately 14 different times throughout the episode that she’s considered “very high end”. Viewers get a fly-on-the-wall perspective in on the pre-collaboration meeting, where we discover that the plan is to fly Luxe and six hand-picked influencers out to Cannes to make the campaign shoot suitably “bougie”, before witnessing the ensuing panic that comes when it’s not certain she’s going to receive the clothes on time. Thankfully, they do eventually make it, with the key piece originally missing from the line-up hurriedly made and shipped from China in the space of just 48 hours. The brand really doesn’t fuck about with the ‘fast’ element of ‘fast fashion’. There’s no denying that the show is really well made; interesting, entertaining, and totally addictive, but it’s also a stark reminder of pretty much everything that’s wrong with the fast fashion model. CEO, founder, and protagonist of the show Adam Frisby is, in his own words, never happy. He expects things done impossibly fast and done his way. His high-pressure approach is no doubt why he’s made such a success of his company, but the effect it has on his staff, suppliers, and his long-suffering, frequently eye-rolling partner Jamie is clear to see as they field his constant calls and voice messages. “Adam is quite a demanding person, he puts a lot of pressure, even in the night time in my home, 10 o’clock, 11 o’clock… When he wants something he will push,” says Asim, one of In The Style’s manufacturing factory bosses who is tasked in episode five with making an exact copy of a beige knitted bodysuit seen on Kylie Jenner’s Instagram just days before. They’re up againt it, as every other fast-fashion brand vies to be the first. Not only is Frisby putting pressure on those in direct contact with him, it could easily be claimed he’s putting pressure on the planet and the people in his supply chain. Founded after he bought six dresses from a wholesaler and sold them online for a small profit, In The Style has grown in scope astronomically since its inception in 2013 and, with Breaking Fashion, we’re seemingly expected to celebrate the rags to riches narrative behind the brand. But is now really the time to be glorifying this type of high volume, low price business model? We’re in the midst of a climate emergency and the effects of fast fashion – and the fashion industry as a whole – are there for everyone to see, from the deaths of garments workers to dangerously polluted rivers and tonnes upon tonnes of waste. “When people think, ‘oh it’s fast fashion that means they’re not sustainable, that means they don’t care’, I like to challenge that,” says Frisby in the intro to each episode. But over the course of six 30-minute episodes, we see very little evidence to support that claim. When asked whether any consideration had been given to sustainability, particularly as it’s a licence fee-funded programme, a BBC spokesperson said: “Throughout filming, the team sought out opportunities to highlight and challenge the contributors on the subject of sustainability as stories naturally unfolded. For example in episode three when 400 Danni Dyer bikinis are supplied in the wrong fabric, and the company must find a way to sell them to avoid them going to landfill, or episode five when Adam describes the company’s philosophy on sustainability: ‘we’re not saying buy it once and throw it away, we’re saying buy it once and make it last’.” “It’s not really right to make light-hearted documentaries about this business model. You’re telling me that they couldn’t find 10 minutes to have a proper investigation into really important issues that dog the industry?” – Lucy Siegle, executive producer of seminal fashion documentary The True Cost By allowing In The Style to direct the conversation around sustainability, the documentary does absolutely nothing to challenge its business model or supply chain. We don’t know how many garments it makes per year, we don’t know what it does with unsold stock, we don’t know whether the people who make its clothes are paid a living wage, nor do we know what happens to the many samples it produces in the fitting process. And when we asked In The Style some of these questions, ultimately, no one from the label got in touch with a response. On its website, In The Style say it works in collaboration with the Marine Conservation Society, donating 1p per purchase, and it also works in partnership with the reGAIN app. But that’s merely putting a plaster on a gaping wound that, arguably, it has helped create. Lucy Siegle was the executive producer for the seminal fashion documentary The True Cost. She is also an author, journalist, a TV reporter, and presenter for a plethora of programmes, including many for the BBC. “I think they may have just ticked editorial policy boxes because they included the main protagonist… Adam, suggesting that he was answering charges about sustainability,” she says. While she gets how it passed the criteria, she doesn’t believe that gives the BBC a free pass. “I think it points to some weakness in the commissioning process,” Siegle continues. “We’ve had the Environmental Audit Committee looking at (the industry), there’s a UN fashion charter, there’s actual framework about how we tackle this monstrous system of overproduction. It’s not really right to make light-hearted documentaries about this business model. You’re telling me that they couldn’t find 10 minutes to have a proper investigation into really important issues that dog the industry?” Qiulae Wong, co-founder of Common Objective, echoes Siegle’s sentiments. “Issues such as the huge amount of waste and pollution that occurs as a result of such high volumes of clothing being produced were unfortunately neglected. The BBC’s Breaking Fashion series missed an opportunity to communicate an important message,” she tells Dazed. Siegle suggests that the BBC could have produced an accompanying Made In Chelsea-style breakdown of the series. But we didn’t get that, so the backlash played out on social media and Frisby did not take kindly to it. “Get a day job my dear… nobody gives a shit about what you’re saying!” was one response to someone taking him to task over sustainability. His other Twitter responses were just as caustic, and Lorna Luxe got in on the action too, messaging a number of sustainable retailers who had discussed the programme calling them ‘a scam’. Their defensiveness speaks volumes. The lightning speed production of hundreds upon hundreds of thousands of garments a year is, at its core, completely unsustainable and no amount of 1p donations will change that. Our environment is spiralling into disaster and the BBC could have used Breaking Fashion as a kicking off point for an important conversation, but it completely missed the mark. It was nothing more than an advert for a brand that’s piling more pressure on an already weary planet.

"It’s Buffalo Zine's 10th birthday, and this time around the issue looks a little rough around the edges – because, as Buffalo’s editor-in-chief Adrian Gonzalez-Cohen puts it: “Let’s not sugar coat it: basically we didn’t finish on time.” For its anniversary issue, the biannual zine wanted to show the stressful nature of magazine making, and the all-too-often feelings of hopelessness and despair that come with setting a deadline (key word: dead). Instead of pushing to meet the cut-off point, they said ‘fuck it!’, and let the deadline meet them, regardless of how ready they were. The result? Beautiful chaos, with almost 500 deconstructed pages of fashion and features (including one by Dazed’s own Emma Hope Allwood). Each page is filled with annotated interviews, illustrations, and editorials, plus the odd Post-It note and spelling mistake. Coincidentally, the release of the magazine comes at a poignant moment, after news broke that Virgil Abloh was set to take a break from fashion earlier this month. Flying internationally up to eight times a week, the designer’s announcement that he would be stepping back for a while served to highlight the pressures placed on those working within the industry. Buffalo's ‘unfinished’ zine continues this conversation, removing the exterior gloss of fashion and showing what really goes into making a magazine happen. “This is Buffalo Zine with her knickers down.

"Alessandro Michele has a knack for tapping the best talent for Gucci – from the likes of Florence Welch to septugenarian acting legend, Vanessa Redgrave. Today though, it’s been announced that Dazed favourites Hari Nef, Petra Collins and Dakota Johnson will be joining the Gucci gang in an as-yet-unknown new project. The trans icon, prolific fashion photographer and Hollywood actress make a formidable trio. While Nef tirelessly advocates for trans rights alonside modelling and acting, Collins has gained attention for her female-centric photography which powerfully subverts the male gaze. As for Johnson, she’s set to star in a remake of the cult 70s Italian horror film Suspiria this year. This isn’t the first time Nef or Collins have worked for Michele though. Both have walked in the house’s runway shows, while Petra also spent some time on the other side of the lens for once, starring in the brand’s AW16 ad campaign shot by another favourite of Michele’s, photographer Glen Luchford. (Don’t be suprised if this new project is also lensed by him.) With only the added note of ‘#InBloom’ to go on, your guess is as good as ours as to what this will entail – but we’re already there for the line up. Watch this space.

"Last night at New York Fashion Week, Opening Ceremony’s SS16 show verged on a dance recital. The brand’s creative directors Humberto Leon and Carol Lim recruited the New York City Ballet to model the collection, alongside professional models. The dance troupe pirouetted their way down the catwalk, even performing some choreographed falls (see below). “It was about breaking the monotony of the runway,” said Leon, explaining the rationale behind these falls. “We wanted to challenge the idea of what a fashion show is.” But it’s not the first time the designers have eschewed a traditional approach to the runway. At their SS15 show, Her director Spike Jonze and The Wolf of Wall Street actor Jonah Hill staged a 30-minute play. The collection itself was inspired by American architect Frank Lloyd-Wright, specifically the relationship between him and his daughter who was, though it’s not commonly known, a modern dancer. However, the collection bore reference to Lloyd-Wright in more literal ways too. For example, the stained glass window panels he designed for Coonley House, images of which were screen printed onto t-shirts. Elsewhere the collection, and indeed the show venue, gave a glimpse into the pair’s approach to interior design. “There was this idea of living,” said Leon. “We were really inspired by all the trips we’ve been on over the years, all the things we’ve collected for the home.” Beautiful objects, including house plants, lined the runway, echoing Lloyd-Wright’s architectural mantra of designing structures that sit in harmony with their environments.

"Vivienne Westwood has unexpectedly thrown her support behind Jeremy Corbyn, calling the Labour leader a “winner” and praising him for his environmental policies. The legendary designer and activist – who is famously outspoken when it comes to politics – shared her thoughts on the upcoming election in a new statement released earlier today. Despite previously being staunchly behind the Green Party, she revealed that she had recently switched sides after reading Corbyn’s 2017 Labour manifesto. “I'm excited about the Labour Party manifesto because it’s all about the fair distribution of wealth” the icon explained. “Jeremy clearly wants to go green and creating a fair distribution of wealth is the place to start, from there we can build a green economy which will secure our future”. She confirmed that she was offering her full support to Corbyn, adding: “We have to build a green economy. For me, he’s a winner.” Westwood’s politics have been a colossal part of her creative life, with the designer using her platform to tackle everything from Wikileaks and gender inequality to Scottish independence and industrial farming. Most recently, she’s been seen actively campaigning for a ban on fracking – something that Corbyn has pledged to get rid of if he becomes prime minister. “Right away, the Labour Party will ban Fracking which just proves they care about people and our beautiful country,” she continued. “Fracking is economic and environmental madness”. Westwood went on to accuse the Conservatives of using “fake science” to hide the truth about the dangers of fracking and shale gas (a fact that was confirmed in a recent report by The Ecologist). She also added that the party’s manifesto had “betrayed” people in Britain, as it promised to take away their local decision-making powers. “Fracking kills and the majority of British people don't want it,” the activist concluded. “I just think it would be so positive for us all if Labour did win the election.” Read the full Labour manifesto for 2017 here

"Last year, the Pirelli Calendar – known for artful erotica and hypersexual photography – scrapped its scantily clad supermodels for a more “influential” lineup. Calling in names like Yoko Ono, Patti Smith and Tavi Gevinson, the 2016 edition was branded as a major departure for the company. “I started to think about the roles that women play, women who have achieved something,” Annie Leibovitz, the calendar photographer, explained at the time. Now, for its 2017 edition, Pirelli appear to be sticking with the same theme. Shifting the focus further from its high fashion roots, the Italian multinational has instead turned its attention to Hollywood’s most iconic actresses. The latest calendar – shot by Pirelli alumni Peter Lindbergh – will feature some of the biggest names from the film world’s past and present. This includes Uma Thurman, Nicole Kidman, Charlotte Rampling, Julianne Moore, Robin Wright and Helen Mirren. The biggest breakthrough stars of the last decade – like Jessica Chastain, Lupita Nyong’o, Rooney Mara, and Lea Seydoux – will also feature. Lindbergh reportedly took the pictures in five locations, over two continents. “(These images are) a love song to the women I really know and really like,” he told Vogue yesterday. “Everyone in this calendar, at one point in my life, I wanted to marry, and I didn't have the balls to ask them!” He also offered some insight into Pirelli’s new direction, hinting that it was a protest move against the “bullshit” ideals of contemporary beauty. “Beauty today is really twisted, for commercial reasons, so people think beautiful is what you see in advertising and in magazines – all these retouched women,” he added. “You have to be perfect, you have to be thin, you have to be young – you have to be all this, and this is bullshit.” Sneak a peek at the first behind the scenes images from the shoot above.

"Tim Walker started his career at 24. It was the mid-90s and he was assisting Richard Avedon in his studio. Now, almost 25 years later, Walker is regarded as a legend in his own right. A force of nature in the fashion world, he has shot for the likes of Dazed, AnOther Man and many (many) more. While much of his work is recognisable for its otherworldly and idiosyncratic nature, to call him a fashion photographer feels inaccurate. His work stretches far beyond the realms of fashion, landing in a beautifully curated other dimension. Walker is a story-teller, and fashion is the vehicle which drives his surreal and captivating narratives. From Hieronymous Bosch-inspired Garden of Earthly Delights sets, to recreating Alice in Wonderland in with Duckie Thot as as Alice herself and Ru Paul as the Queen of Hearts, Walker's imagination knows no bounds. Opening this weekend, new exhibition Wonderful Things steps into the mind of Tim Walker. Four years in the making, this show is far more than a chronological retrospective of the photographer's work. Instead, it peers deep into his imagination, exploring his various inspirations. “it's not purely about fashion, and that's what makes it so special. He's able to create stunning, spectacular pictures, but also subtly connect to the pertinent issues of our time” – Susanna Brown Held at the V&A, the photographer's iconic images are placed in decorative rooms which reflect and expand on the themes the photos explore. In one space, intimate disposables taken at Glastonbury sit alongside Vogue editorials, while, at other end of the room, portraits of Frank Ocean taking a selfie, David Attenborough holding a dinosaur egg, and Joanna Lumley lighting a mouthful of cigarettes, show off Walker’s unique ability to create a narrative even in the most deceptively simple images. Elsewhere, nudes including the likes of Beth Ditto peer down from the walls, with other spaces are designed to look like 80s living rooms and photography studios. The point is to not only see the images but to step inside them. “I don't think we would want to approach it in a traditional way,” Susanna Brown, the show's curator, explains. Detailing what makes Walker different from so many other fashion photographers, she says it's his ability to conjure up other worlds while still rooting it in the here and now. “I think so much of Tim's work is about make-believe. But, it's not purely about beauty, it's not purely about fashion, and that's what makes it so special. He's able to create stunning, spectacular pictures, but also subtly connect to the pertinent issues of our time.” Here, we sit down with Brown as she explains why this was never going to be a conventional exhibition, where the legendary photographer finds his inspiration, and why now? “It's funny, but I never think of Tim as a fashion photographer. I think of him as just an incredibly creative person and an artist who weaves in fantastical narratives. Of course, he's very knowledgable about fashion and clothes. He loves knitting, embroidery, and is very interested in the textures of things. But I have to say we didn't spend a lot of time talking about fashion in isolation. I think for him the fashion industry and the magazines are like Renaissance art patrons that allow him to create the pictures his mind imagines and the dream worlds he wants to build in front of the camera. He's used that metaphor before, the idea of fashion itself as a benefactor, as a patron to the artist, and I think it's a very good metaphor.” “I don't think we would want to approach it in a traditional way. I don't think we would imagine this as a kind of conventional retrospective exhibition, or a chronological survey exhibition. It should be something that speaks about the V&A as an important source of inspiration to creative people.” “Tim spent a year researching our collection. He explored the collection, found the objects he loved, and then embarked on the photoshoots inspired by those objects. He chose things like a photo of the Bayeux Tapestry and a shoot would explode out of that object. The treasures from the V&A were always the starting point, rather than me looking at the pictures and saying, we've got something in the V&A that would go with this.” “Some of the clothing from our fashion collection belonged to Edith Sitwell, there's also a beautiful portrait of her by Cecil Beaton, one of Tim's favourite photographers, and a painting by Edith Dawson of her gorgeous conservatory of plants. From finding those Tim explained ‘One of my longstanding collaborators and my muses is Tilda Swinton, and she's related to Edith Sitwell, so why don't we do something with Tilda embodying the spirit of Edith Sitwell, and the eclecticism and the beauty of Edith?’ Sitwell was a very striking woman, but she certainly wasn't a conventionally beautiful woman. What Tim loves about Sitwell is that she really owned her weirdness and kind of revelled in her difference to everyone else.” “It's not just about fashion. It's not just about the clothes. Yes, the clothes are a very important part of building a picture and building a narrative, but there's so much more going on. It doesn't jump out at you immediately, but when you spend time with the pictures, you realise a lot of the issues Tim is engaging with. These new pictures look at very pertinent contemporary issues, things like nuclear energy; the wastefulness and consumption of the mainstream fashion industry and fast fashion; themes of sexuality and representation of diversity in the media. There are lots of political and sociological themes, and that's what makes it very special. Tim has the ability to create stunning, spectacular pictures, but also connect to those issues in a subtle way. You know he's not a documentary photographer, but he is still engaged with the real world, beyond high fashion, or beyond couture.” Tim Walker: Wonderful Things is at the V&A from 21 September 2019 to 8 March 2020 vam.ac.uk

"With insane tuition fees, part-time jobs and ever-increasing rent, isn’t exactly news that life as a creative student in London can be difficult. If you’re an international student, there’s also the looming spectre of visa issues, and the fact that you might get booted out of the country as soon as you finally earn that diploma. Australian-born designer Bianca Batson found herself facing all of the above when she moved to London to study at CSM. While most might crumble under the pressure, or just give in entirely, Batson decided to instead channel her fears into her work. After moving to London from Brisbane Batson settled on a multidisciplinary approach to design, choosing to create collages, photographs and films in addition to the menswear and womenswear looks that use materials like latex and chains in unconventional ways – all with added sparkle courtesy of Swarovski who sponsor her. For her new MA collection, the young designer was triggered (literally) by Brexit and the fact that she will likely have to leave the country when she finishes her studies. The collages she created while working on the collection feature news clippings that reference Brexit as well as political unrest in America. “Recently there is so much happening in terms of immigration, and not just within the European Union, in general in America, in the UK, everywhere,” she told us. “So I thought, I’m gonna look at all the issues that our generation are facing, just explore that and use this as a platform.” Not content with presenting her designs in the traditional form of a lookbook, Batson decided to instead host an exhibition. Pooling the talents of the creative community immediately around her, the final result was a melting pot of fashion, photography, set design and film. “I think a big part of it was having people feel more involved than simply looking through a lookbook or coming to a presentation or a show. I wanted a real way to connect the collage and research to the clothing to show why I’ve done them both together.” Here, we talk to Batson about her exhibition and referencing Brexit in her design process. How did you get to where you are today? Bianca Batson: I started designing when I was in high school – it was always like, ‘I’m going to be a designer’. So I started studying in Australia and then I came to London to do a six-month exchange and I was like, ‘Oh my god I can’t live in Brisbane anymore’. It’s beautiful but so boring. So I dropped out of uni and I applied for my visa for London. I applied to Central Saint Martins just to see, and I got in so decided to restart my degree over here. How has your approach to design changed since moving to London? Bianca Batson: For me, it was an opportunity to just work creatively as opposed to thinking ‘If I make something out of chain I’d never able to sell that’. Going to Saint Martins that doesn’t matter – it’s irrelevant, almost. I did an internship at Ashish in my placement year, and after I finished that I got really bored so I just started really documenting my life and my friends. That’s how photography became really, really important to me. And then I guess the two just started to work alongside each other. What was the starting point for this collection? Bianca Batson: It started off with an image of Johnny Rotten from the PiL exhibition at the ICA last year that Dennis Morris put together. He’s just standing in a glittery blue suit and it made think of all these punk references. Punk musicians were wearing suits on stage as a fuck you to the middle class. My BA collection had leather suits as well, but I decided to use a lot of latex this season, which is quite new for me. I’ve used it in ways that it’s not fetish wear at all, it’s the complete opposite. There’s cute little dresses and there’s an evening dress, and then I’ve also done suits as well. What is your approach when designing a collection? Bianca Batson: The way I work is really similar to my collages. I work in 3D – I don’t really draw, so I’ll play with textiles and photograph it and play around. A lot of the stuff I make is quite handmade – so there’s a dress that’s made entirely from chain and it must have like 400 metres of it. I love the idea of using things in unconventional ways. All the graphics I’ve done myself as well. “Even some of my close friends are like, ‘Hold on, wait, you have to leave in April?’. They’ve only said this to me now because they’re looking at my collages, and at my work” – Bianca Batson You also like to reference social and political issues too, right? Bianca Batson: The main reason my approach to things contains these political and social messages is because I’ve constantly been asked since I began my Masters, and actually even before I finished my BA, ‘Ok so what do you want to do when you finish?’ For me, being Australian, the first I have to think of is ‘I need a visa’, so every decision I’ve made this year, I’ve had that on the back of my mind. I can’t rely on just going freelance when I graduate, I need to apply for jobs, and how am I going to get there? I just realised that it was really important to me, and I could really make a project of it. Why was it important for you to spotlight Brexit in particular? Bianca Batson: I think it’s interesting to be reminded about it in a fashion context. I think a lot of people don’t realise the repercussions of it – even some of my close friends are like, ‘Hold on, wait, you have to leave in April?’. They’ve only said this to me now because they’re looking at my collages, and at my work – I say ‘I’ve been telling you this for how long?’ But it’s only just registering. What was it like putting together the exhibition? Bianca Batson: I’ve never done an exhibition before so there was a lot running around, last minute kind of things. Sorting DJ, playlists – making sure the music’s perfect. Set design as well because the space that I used, basically it’s an empty building and it’s kind of covered in graffiti. I utilised a lot of friends’ – my friend Austin made a handbag for me, and then my friend Louis designed a newspaper for one of the rooms. My other friend Dom helped with the set design, so it’s been great to work with people and their talents as well, combining everything. What does the future hold for you? Bianca Batson: I’d love to get a job, after five years of studying I’m tired of being broke. But at the same time, I do really love doing my own thing. I am just going to continue to do the freelance stuff and eventually one day I would love to be the creative director of a fashion company. You have to think big otherwise you get bored – you’ve got to work towards something. @biancabatson

"This is Fashion Weak, a five-part salacious/spiritual/sometimes sad series of essays about how a former unconvincingly closeted musical theatre major managed to get past the VIP New York City “fashion world” ropes, making a trainwreck of an entrance. The “fashion world” is a trigger for my bipolar II, broken-ish brain. So, because self-awareness and self-care is very on-trend right now, I consciously and responsibly uncoupled with New York Fashion Week last season. I wasn’t getting much (see also: any) assignments for what was once my most psychotic work week of the year, anyway. Which is weird, because I’ve been doing the freelance fashion writer thing throughout all of my twenties, and I’m thirty and shockingly stable-ish now. That’s right – I’m not a masochistic mess anymore! Rage-cutting the VIP line at Alexander Wang after-parties to intoxicatedly bark “I’m press!” at publicists who had just murdered my ego with immaculate vocal fry (“Sorry, you’re like, not on the list...”) is a thing of my problematic past. I’m (hopefully) through with epitomising everything I continue to hate: the privileged, delusional, fame-hungry, OD-friendly hedonist. AKA, the gross millennial cliché. Desperate for the “likes” in any way, shape or form. That was then. It’s 2017, and everything is way more fine now. Pause on that – ‘fine’. That word haunted me for forever. Fine. You look fine (in a Forever 21 outfit covered in cat fur.) You sound fine (I’m a theatre school dropout.) Your article was fine (die!) I wasn’t fine before, during or after my interview with Cara Delevingne, which went down in September of 2014 during NYFW SS15 at Cara’s Mulberry bag collection launch party. This wasn’t my first time at the being-assigned-to-interview-a-famous-person-I’m-indifferent-about rodeo, but I was feeling off when I needed to be on, and it was freaking me out. I’ve never been a fan of these chaotically crammed in-store events – they take place in the early evening, so most guests aren’t wasted just yet, and the lighting is unforgiving, particularly when I’m not feeling so cute (which, when I wasn’t shitfaced, was always). Do not get me started on the floor-length mirrors – on that night, I was the last person I wanted to see. I was unusually nervous for my interview. I was denied a chain-smoking break, because the paps/fans were losing their goddamn minds on the SoHo cobblestone streets outside, so I was glued to my cracked iPhone in the back of the store, furiously deleting emails I wasn’t going to respond to from pushy publicists with their relentless pitches concerning the next “It Girl.” I ignore the professional and confident Teen Vogue reporter who’s standing next to me (okay, he’s actually the one ignoring me). He’s obviously priority to interview Cara first, and he’s designer-clad, cool as a vodka-infused cucumber cocktail, and you know, not fat. He is summoned by the publicist. My heart beats faster. Within seconds, I hear Cara cackling in the distance. They’re BFFs! And then... A SELFIE! Meanwhile, I’m grinding my teeth like I gargled with amphetamines. Everything’s FINE, I tell myself – that word again – as I wait and I wait. Totally fine. I’m wearing the sweat/fat-veiling and also predictably “fashion” all black outfit. I’ve got this. I have not got this. The Propranolol – usually a godsend for stage fright and its symptoms of clammy hands, stuttering, not breathing – is failing me. I knew I shouldn’t have inhaled that lavender whatever the fuck cocktail they offered me at the door. Suddenly, it’s time. “You have five minutes with Cara!” growls the publicist. I awkwardly plop down next to the model, my severe fear of intimacy triggered by our proximity on this tiny couch. I push back the panic, and open with a “Hi girl!” So far, so good. Chill Girl Cara acts like she loves me, so I have no reason to not be fine... for about 45 seconds. Am I breathing? Will the perma-cracked iPhone that I’m using to record our interview spasm free of my convulsing hand and chip Cara’s beautiful teeth? I can’t hold it back. On the sofa in the Mulberry store, perched sweating next to Cara Delevingne, I let go. There’s a tear or three, which I maybe veil via the perspiration super-slide racing from my hairline. She tries to comfort me with compliments re: my Janet Jackson ‘Rhythm Nation’ tour t-shirt, my deteriorating nail art, my Britney-related tattoo (free – in exchange for my Ultra Music Festival raver makeover piece for ELLE.com, which, according to my lovely editor, ""performed poorly."") “It’s so hot in here!” I gay squeal as my apologetic goodbye once it’s over. Cara can see right through me. She’s so nice and normal, probably just figuring I was a crazy fan. She’d be right about the crazy part. “Am I breathing? Will the perma-cracked iPhone that I’m using to record our interview spasm free of my convulsing hand and chip Cara’s beautiful teeth?” Unlike the Teen Vogue writer, I float through the champagne-spilling socialites who have filled the store without a selfie with Cara, which sucks because it would’ve surely skyrocketed my sad Instagram following. My article for Yahoo Style was fine though – I went for the “Cara Made Me Straight!” angle. It hurt to RT it – until Cara did, and then I felt special for like eight minutes. But I’m not special. Everyone comes to hate their job and themselves, and who isn’t mentally ill!? I don’t have a talent fee. I RT too much. No one’s flying my ass to Paris for fashion week. I prefer random press trips that do the luxe escapism job – like when I went to Shenzhen Fashion Week for this website you’re on right now. Also, the masseuse (escort) an editor may or may not have bought me made up for the light food poisoning. But there was a time when I was fantastic-ish at interviewing celebs, especially circa my thirty-pounds-lighter days. (Thanks, Mononucleosis.) Confident, carefree, a burgeoning Famous Only Below 14th Street type! Special! I lived for this! I yearned for the superstar auras to rub off on me! Ashlee Simpson showered my studded Converse (I know) in champagne! Wendy Williams praised my smile! I INTERVIEWED PATTI SMITH. ‘Twas all dreamy and easy-ish, even the many times I gave minimal shits about whoever I'd be assigned to interview. I’d do it for the readers and the like, $150! (Tip: Just ask these special somethings what their zodiac sign is and/or tell them they have really good energy. They love that shit). And even when I’ve been dissed (Karlie Kloss perpetually sashays away from me; Zoë Kravitz’s publicist email-screamed at me; Sofia Coppola called me out: “You have nothing to ask me, do you?”), I get the job done. Like, I asked Jessica awful Alba for a quote for Paper magazine in 2011, with her deadpan response being “I’m okay...” before she vanished into an even more famous crowd. My six-ish second exchange with her was my best performing post of that season. It's all about the clicks, the likes, the shares. Because the only kind of substance that anyone cares about (and, if you’re lucky, shares) these days is the illegal kind you’d find packed into an impractically tiny baggie. I would know. The Cara meltdown wasn’t supposed to happen. This was meant to be my comeback! I’d returned to my rent-stabilised (#blessed) apartment less than a month before this from the no-frills Pride Institute, located in a sad Minnesota suburb, housing only LGBTQ fuck-ups. Thirty glorious days in treatment to save me from myself! I wasn’t a traditional addict – I guess I was maybe addicted to feeling special and I absolutely was suffering from imposter syndrome, desperate for a break from the fashion world fuckery. But rehab was too dangerously real, and I bounced in the middle of my seventh night, back to my hedonistic heaven/hell. I’d lie to my friends and blame a Medicaid coverage error for the reason the month was unceremoniously cut short. Fine would just take... a while. Good things come for those who don’t overdose, or something. There wasn’t a singular rock bottom, no one devastating point of no return. And things did get better. The shrinks and psychiatrists, the Ted Talks, the one-week-in-rehab thing, the hanging with real friends, the no longer comparing myself with Instagram poets and meme-maker “friends” with 100K+ followers... that all helped. And, sorry, but here’s another famous namedrop: Courtney Love. I’ve interviewed her a ton over the years, and she helped most profoundly by introducing me to Buddhist chanting. This soul-saving happened the NYFW season after the tragic Cara thing, but that’s another essay, so, stay tuned. I wish I could’ve chatted with Cara about her mental health journey and how she got better. I wish I asked her if any happy pills were rolling around inside her Cara x Mulberry bag along with her eyebrow gel. Alas, my questions had to be approved pre-interview, and her responses wouldn’t have made the cut, anyway. It is what it is. It’s just a job. And, besides the pathetic pay, a really cool one! I mean, I recently interviewed my childhood icon, Ginger Spice, for my Vogue.com debut! The highs, the meaningful ones, help me deal better with the lows. “Cara can see right through me, probably just figuring I was a crazy fan. She’d be right about the crazy part” Actually, I’m often better than fine these days, which is crazy. And when I’m not fine, when the “nothingness inside of me” feeling makes a cameo, when the doom scolds my internal inbox like Zoe Kravitz’s publicist did my Gmail, I’ll look up at my inspiration wall. Up there is a xeroxed copy of the “Personal Bill of Rights” I took with me from my one-week-in-rehab. 24. I have the right to believe I am a worthwhile person, JUST BY BEING HERE AND ALIVE!!! Still, there are times when I’m just not there. I’ll be psychotically happy while on an eleven-hour flight en route to a comped dream trip. And then the clouds make a cameo, and I’m in a window seat. I prefer aisle (and, worst case scenario, a tiny dose of Klonopin) because I can escape to the toilet where I’ll whisper a Buddhist chant, and maybe throw in a grounding rehab exercise (Instructions: stomp on the floor to feel present). I’ll remind myself that I’m not alone re: actually being sick in the head, that many are afraid of “getting better.” We’re comfortable with the clouds because we know that’s where we really belong. Last row, in coach, with connection-failing WiFi. Fight or flight! But those thoughts aren’t anything special. They’re just sad. What is “special”? I think it’s all about being here and being alive. I think it’s being fine with fine being enough. Follow Alex on Instagram @acatinheat, and our illustrator João Victor @mirror_dsoul. Stay tuned for part two, coming soon.

"If you know anything about Hedi Slimane – besides his skinny tailoring and ability to ruffle feathers with some very minor typographic changes – it’s probably that music forms the heart of much of his design. From London: Birth of a Cult, the 2005 photobook which was a study of Pete Doherty, Babyshambles, and the London scene, to his Saint Laurent Music Project, which featured legends like Joni Mitchell and Marilyn Manson, Slimane has spent his career aligning himself with some of music’s biggest names. Beyond photography, that’s extended onto the stage. Since his Dior Homme days, Slimane has dressed musicians for live shows. At the 2002 CDFAs, where Slimane was the first menswear designer to receive the CFDA International Designer award, none other than David Bowie, whom Hedi dressed for his tours, presented the designer with the award. This very week he dressed Keith Richards in Celine for the opening show of the Rolling Stones’ US tour in Chicago – a partnership that’s set to continue as the tour unfolds. Ahead of tomorrow’s Celine menswear show, check out the gallery above for some on-stage shots.

"At the end of last week, online fast fashion brand Missguided released a £1 bikini. Yes, that's one pound for an entire bikini set. While the price may sound appealing to some (proven by the fact this is the second time the fast fashion label has dropped the item and it promptly sold out again this time round), others took to Twitter to condemn the bikini, as they discussed the expoitation of workers, the ramifications that something like this will have on the planet, and what the actual point is (beside column inches for making the cheapest clothing) given the company is definitely making a loss. Since the tragedy of the Rana Plaza disaster in 2013, non-profit organisation Fashion Revolution has staged Fashion Revolution Weeks, which aim to draw attention to ethical dilemmas in the fashion industry. One of the issues that has become more prominent in discussions about ethical sourcing, is the mistreatment of factory workers. When it comes down to it, several things contribute to the final price of merchandise: the production, packaging, shipping, and more. If the end price of an item in this case is £1, which is likely not reflective of the process, how much money is being returned to workers? Notably, Missguided was one of the labels found to be working with UK-based sweatshops, as detailed in a report published last year. nobody: missguided: sHOp ouR £1 biKiNi!! fUcK thE enViroNmenT! bUy iT jUst fOr tHe sAke oF iT! fAst faShiOn woOo🤪🤪💸 Likewise, we all know by now (or at least should know) that a climate emergency has been declared, and that the fashion industry has a huge part to play when it comes to rectifying its mistakes to ensure the earth's future. From the environmental impact caused by the use of fur, to the revelation of how many brands burn their unsold stock, and the fact that many items sent back as returns actually just end up in landfill, it goes without saying that fashion labels, and particularly fast fashion labels, could and should be doing more to prevent the outcomes of climate change. As a starting point, in this instance, they could probably start by not making ludicrously cheap items that will likely end up in the bin as soon as the summer is over. On top of the issue surrounding the cost, people took to Twitter to display their frustrations towards the point that the bikini itself is not sustainable and made from 85 per cent polyester. One user said, “Let’s just think for a minute about how many thousands of these bikinis are going to sell this summer, to then end up being thrown away because they will inevitably fall apart because they’re ONE POUND. Polyester is NOT biodegradable. 20-200 years is the timestamp polyester has to decompose depending on the conditions it is in. The fact that so many people will be buying this shit ass bikini to go and enjoy the beauty of our planet e.g. the beach is just…” Missguided's latest release comes soon after the French government announced that each year over 650 million Euros worth of product is either thrown away or burned. Taking a stand against the implications this has on the planet, the French prime minister explained that over the next four years the nation would work to implement new legislation, which makes the destruction of surplus stock illegal. Hopefully Britain won't be too far behind. We reached out to Missguided for comment, but as yet have received no response.

"The new trailer has finally dropped for Karl Lagerfeld's long-awaited Chanel film, Once and Forever. Featuring Kristen Stewart as both Coco Chanel and an actress playing Coco Chanel, the 11 minute short is a confusingly meta take on the fashion founder's life. “(Kristen is) so good,” Lagerfeld explained to WWD. “I think she’s one of the greatest actors of her generation. She gives the right emotion and the right intensity immediately so it’s very easy to work her...” And, judging by early reports, the film will show a whole new (and highly sassy) side of the Clouds of Sils Maria actress. “She played it really, really mean,” the creative director added. “She’s complaining about everything. She’s mean with the director; mean with the producer.” The film will be shown in its entirety at the Chanel’s Métiers d’Art show on December 1. In the meantime, you can whet your appetite by watching the quick 30 second teaser below.

"As the singer’s appearance at Dior’s Paris Fashion Week show confirmed, the fashion industry can’t get enough of Rihanna. And now, just ten days later, the queen of pop has been announced as a musical guest at this year’s Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show. The brand made the announcement via Instagram, telling its 23.4 million followers that the singer will be performing at the show, which will be staged in New York in December, alongside Selena Gomez and The Weeknd. Of course the singer – who revealed her new album artwork last week – will also be joined by the infamous Victoria’s Secret Angels such as Adriana Lima, Alessandro Ambrosio, Behati Prinsloo, Candice Swanepoel and Lily Aldridge. But this won’t be Rihanna’s VS debut; the singer joined Justin Bieber and Bruno Mars at the 2012 show, performing renditions of “Diamonds” and “Presh Out The Runway”. While the musical guests have been announced, the model line-up (put together by legendary casting director John Pfeiffer) is yet to be revealed. And while nothing’s been confirmed, Gigi and Bella Hadid are rumoured to star in it for the first time. Last year’s show was held in London, for the first time in the brand’s 20-year history, and saw Taylor Swift, Ed Sheeran and Ariana Grande (wearing a costume made in collaboration with London designer Nasir Mazhar). Watched in over 190 countries, the event has become the most watched fashion show in the world – thanks, in part, to its musical guests, as well as its high-profile (as well as scantily-clad) models.

"Last night in NYC, Moschino designer Jeremy Scott joined forces with H&M to debut their very highly anticipated #HMOSCHINO collaboration – and unsurprisingly, they put on a SHOW. Here’s what went down. Drag Race winner and Dazed Beauty contributing editor Aquaria was there, in a CD print puffa and some extremely fishy fishnets. Marc Jacobs and his beau Char Defrancesco also put in an appearance, as did nightlife legend Amanda Lepore. Making up the rest of the FROW were the likes of Frances Bean Cobain, Paris Jackson, and Leigh Lezark. ...with TV screens, giant faux building cutouts, and illuminated billboards showing the campaign images shot by Steven Meisel (“the most important fashion photographer of our lifetime as far as I’m concerned”, said Scott). The set had a meta meaning, too, considering the show was being streamed live to screens in Times Square. Yes it was an H&M collab, but Scott was clear that didn’t mean it was about making compromises. “It’s about keeping the vision as pure as possible,” the designer said pre-show – and that certainly translated into the collection. From chain letter belts to MTV logo mashups, Disney characters to OTT gold baroque prints, it was a poppy celebration of Scott’s signatures and the house’s longstanding codes. Expect to see the sequin puffas, logo tees, thigh high boots, and gold bling coming to an Instagram feed near you. Jeremy Scott is known for his long standing relationships with major models – many of whom he’s worked with since the very beginning of their careers. Gigi opened, followed by Stella Maxwell and Duckie Thot, with Bella (and even baby brother Anwar) not far behind. The eternally fierce Teddy Quinlivan put in an appearance, as did Winnie Harlow and Soojoo Park. Oh, and then there’s the fact that Naomi Campbell closed the show, looking characteristically flawless in silver sequins. After the models did their finale (to Jay-Z’s “Empire State of Mind”, obvs), the party started. It was complete with a shoppable pop up (queue status: epic), fast food stands serving NYC classics like hot dogs, pretzels, and Chinese in mini takeout boxes, and a virtual reality experience. For Scott – who came from a humble background and had to fight his way into fashion – it was important for to create a collection that was accessible and available to those who might not be able to afford to pick stuff off the rack in Moschino. “I did this collection as my gift to the fans,” he shared. “I wanted them to have the most Jeremy Scott for Moschino collection ever. I didn’t want to dilute anything or hold anything back.”

"Hannah Jones is a compelling speaker. At the opening of the V&A’s Fashioned By Nature exhibition, Nike’s Chief Sustainability Officer delivered a captivating view of her – and subsequently the company’s – mission to reinvent the future. In a talk called “Sustainability In A Commercial World”, Jones sat with fashion journalist Marion Hume for a fascinating 90 minutes, talking passionately about her role at Nike (where she’s worked for 18 years), her delight at seeing invention and innovation turn from dream to reality, and how proud she is of not just her own kids, but an entire generation of youth who demand a new world. Sustainability may not be the most exciting word. It is, however, a practice that is crucial to the preservation of our planet. But are people responding to it, and beyond the press releases, are brands really taking it seriously? Nike says yes, having just released its annual sustainability report, a manifesto that includes an aim for the future – zero footwear manufacturing waste, 100 per cent sustainable contract factories, and 100 per cent renewable energy. Crucial to this pledge is Jones – having been leading Nike’s drive for a new world for nearly two decades. Prior to her talk, I met with Jones to discuss Nike’s crisis point in the 90s, collaborating fiercely with other brands, and why she’s happy to see her daughter marching on the street. You’re Nike’s chief sustainability officer, but how much of a conversation is sustainability across the company? Hannah Jones: Pretty profoundly. I’ve been on this journey for probably over 20 years now. In many ways our journey began pretty early and in part because of something different which was the working condition labour crisis that happened in the mid-90s, where we were targeted and accused of poor working conditions. Although that was a massive crisis for the company, it was also a gift because we were one of the first companies to be focused on social impact, i.e don’t just think about your bottom line, think about your social impact. What that woke us up to was that the environment was going to come really fast. For about 20 years we’ve been talking about ‘how do we reduce waste, how do we eliminate waste’. Sustainability is a mission for the whole industry, it’s going to take industrial action. There are still serious amounts of innovation that have to be unlocked to really get to that vision of the good that we collectively have, and that we have for ourselves. How are you going about it? Hannah Jones: About two years ago our CEO Mark Parker set a moonshot for the company – and deliberately nobody knows quite how to get there. Kennedy did a similar thing that was: ‘We’re going to land a man on the moon and get him home safely’. Nobody knew how that was going to happen but it was a galvanising call to action and ours is pretty similar – we’re going to double our business and halve our environmental impact. While we have all this progress, we also know there are all these things that the world has to unlock. How are we going to not just make cotton less water-heavy, but how do you replace cotton with a material that is equal to cotton and the consumer will love as much as cotton? The flyleather (a leather alternative designed to reduce waste) we brought out was a great distraction – I think it’s coming to the UK in September so I’m excited about that – that’s an 80 per cent reduction in water and a 90 per cent reduction in carbon. If I was a VC that would be my unicorn, but I need another 10 unicorns at the scale of which this industry operates, so it’s a relentless hunt for innovation. Fashion is the second biggest polluter in the world. Are you satisfied with what you see industry-wide in terms of the way people are approaching the issue? Hannah Jones: No, not at all. There are leaders in the fashion industry that are really engrossed in this idea of sustainable fashion and what that means, and there are those that are still completely asleep at the wheel and are still in the old school, 19th century power business of cheapest prices and cheapest margins, not thinking about the environmental and social impact. If we are to make progress the good news is that the good actors are all collaborating. I was just with a young Nike employee from the London office and he was gobsmacked cause I was like, ‘Yeah, we’re the one team in the company that collaborates furiously with adidas, Puma, H&M, Stella McCartney’. We all collaborate because the people that understand the journey that we’re on and the transformation that will take place know that yes, there’s a time which we will compete, but most of the time it will take the power and the weight of all of us to transform the system. Are you seeing a shift in terms of how consumers are thinking about sustainability? What are Nike devotees saying? Hannah Jones: It’s a good question. Sci-fi writer William Gibson has this great quote: ‘The future is here, it’s just not distributed equally.’ Ten years ago I would’ve said to you that consumers care but they’re not voting with their purchasing power – today I actually think it’s shifting. I think the mainstream consumer is more activist, living in a polarised world, they’re living with the beginning of the consequences of climate change, they see fragility, they see migration. They’re really smart, they’re seeing the causality, and they’re tying together the threads – they have more information than ever. This young generation is taking to the streets and marching. I just got a text from my daughter, like: ‘Mum I’m going out to march today, are you OK with that?’ I’m like, ‘Yeah I’m OK with that, I’m absolutely OK with that!’ And so what they’re asking of brands is: ‘What do you stand for above and beyond of making products, what’s your purpose?’ For us, our purpose is all about how we enable the athlete to do what they want to do, and part of that is how do we make sure they have access to a world in which they have clean air, they have snow and they have clean water to surf on, or to swim in and you can run. To do that, our commitment is to become sustainable. Which innovation are you most proud of? Hannah Jones: I would say the thing I’m most proud of with what we’ve been doing at Nike is not only one single innovation, but the approach we’ve taken to really put sustainability at the heart of our company and our innovation agenda. Every team in the company is thinking about their footprint and how to innovate. We just announced a few months ago that our entire North America operation and operation facilities will be 100 per cent renewable and we’re already renewable in the distribution centre, in what we have would have been off the grid like 10 years ago. You work in an environment where you constantly think about the future – does the state of the world and where it’s at now excite or scare you? Hannah Jones: I think I’ve never seen the world more polarised with more volatility and more injustice. My personal way of processing that is, to battle down even harder and what can we do in an appropriate way that creates change. With our sustainability agenda, we set our policy on climate and carbon years ago and we’re not changing it – because we’re following the signs. So when you can stay true to your environment and you can stay true to your whole purpose and your really clear about where you're headed the volatility rocks you less because you're on your path. The fact that the US government has pulled out of Paris? Yeah we have been vocal about our disagreement with that, and it is absolutely not stopping us with the work we’re doing to decrease our carbon footprint, if anything we’re doubling down, I think that’s my approach to it – how do you in polarising time, how do you actually double down on purpose, how do you double down on community, how do you double down on engagement and transactions and how do you double down on innovating the future?

"To launch their AW15 menswear collection, NYC-based brand rag & bone hit up two of the world’s best dance talents – with two very different backgrounds. The resulting film depicts a dance-off between legendary ballerino Mikhail Baryshnikov and Chicago’s rising street dance star Lil Buck, who – along with a gang of models – are clad in the new collection. The Russian-born Baryshnikov, who made his name in the 60s and 70s (defecting from the USSR and later becoming principal dancer at the New York City Ballet) may be of a different generation to Lil Buck, who specialises in G-Walking, a style of street dance said to have originated in 80s America, but one thing’s for sure – the 67-year old is able to hold his own.

"It was at the Palais de Tokyo during Paris couture last month that a series of influential industry members – including Michèle Lamy, Hood by Air’s Shayne Oliver and Dazed co-founder Jefferson Hack – gathered to reveal winners of this year’s International Woolmark Prize. Talented designers from around the world were tasked with incorporating Merino wool – the signature textile of The Woolmark Company – into their own designs. After much deliberation, the winners were announced as London design duo Cottweiler and American designer Gabriela Hearst, both of whom will receive support to expand their businesses as a result of the award. Over the last few years, Cottweiler’s Ben Cottrell and Matthew Dainty have emerged as some of the most innovative designers in menswear, developing a singular vision rooted in the worlds of digital art, sportswear fetishism and weirdly inane things like patio furniture. It was important for them to convey this visual identity throughout the challenge – “We wanted to present signature Cottweiler in terms of the look,” they explain, “so inspirations came from the archive and we used those pieces using Merino wool, updating and improving them to fit into the context of the competition.” Victory in the womenswear department went to Gabriela Hearst, a designer renowned for mixing the influences of her childhood in Uruguay with those of her current life in New York. For Hearst, the award carried special resonance due to her own family history. “It has a special meaning to me as a Merino grower myself,” she says. “Wool has been supporting my family for generations. Also, the recognition from such a prestigious award gives me further confidence that I am heading in the right direction.” “We worked closely with our mills to find fabric that kept our aesthetic but also fulfilled the brief – we were very conscious of not losing that” – Cottweiler Perhaps most importantly, both winners managed to create something truly innovative by re-imagining the wool in new, inventive ways. Hearst is already well-versed in Merino and uses it often in her collections – she reveals that the top seller from her recent Cruise collection was made from the textile – but, for this particular challenge, she was keen to show that wool could be viable as both a utilitarian, sports-ready fabric and as a luxury textile. “I wanted to challenge the concept of wool being itchy or only suitable for your grandmother’s sweater,” she argues. As for Cottweiler, the duo worked hard to convey their own visual identity in the competition pieces. For them, this led to a process of textile innovation which eventually resulted in them bonding a waterproof fabric to a Merino jersey – a seamless fusion of man-made and natural fibres. “We worked closely with our mills to find fabric that kept our aesthetic but also fulfilled the brief – we were very conscious of not losing that.” The collaborative collections will be stocked in some of the world’s most prestigious department stores and boutiques including Harvey Nichols, Lane Crawford, mytheresa.com and ssense.com. In celebration of this year’s award The Woolmark Company released ‘Unravelled’, a unique fashion mockumentary written, directed and starring Isaac Lock. Watch a trailer below.

"A meander through a pretty-people purgatory, The Model is a four-part series of pieces written by an anonymous ex-male model. Over the coming weeks, installments will explore social media, body image, and what it’s like chasing success in an industry always hungrily in pursuit of the new. Stay tuned. Soon after I signed to my mother agency, they took me into the basement and taught me how to walk. Having been bipedal for close to 20 years, I had thought that this was knowledge I already possessed, but evidently, I did not. I watched videos of French model Clement Chabernaud on my booker’s phone and then tried to walk like him. Apparently, he had a very strong walk. I walked back and forth down a small corridor in the windowless basement. After 45 minutes, she shrugged and said she had to get back to work. Keep practising and you’ll get it, she said. There tend to be two types of modelling stories. There are the miracles – girls plucked from obscurity to become household names, and then there are the horror stories that we hear less often but that still circulate in the culture; sexual assaults, models falling into spiralling debt to their agencies, developing eating disorders, and entering years of therapy. But what about the thousands of models in-between? Models, by their very nature, end up two-dimensional simulacrums of themselves, so it makes sense that in a world that craves salacious stories we flatten out the complexity of their lives. In doing so, the only ones given a platform to speak are those whose stories fit into our preconceived dichotomy: made it, or didn’t. If the only tales we hear are either psalms to the divine power of beauty (they’re called Victoria’s Secret Angels for a reason) or hellish accounts of misery (tinged with a certain schadenfreude) then I’d offer my story as a meander through a pretty-people purgatory. Most models fall into modelling – they’re scouted, or they turn up to an open-call not really believing they’ll get it and somehow get selected amongst highly unfavourable odds. Very few seriously prepare for it, and despite the existence of shady ‘modelling academies’ in places like China and Nigeria, it’s not really something you can plan for in a meaningful way. Once represented, models hustle themselves around for a few years before they age out of the profession or realise they aren’t going to make it and decide to take the money they’ve earned, if any, and invest it back into something they see as having a future. One of the guys I modelled with was a mycologist (he studied mushrooms) and he’s now getting a master’s degree. Another qualified as a personal trainer. One is now a successful photographer. The people who are the most mentally stable and ‘successful’ in modelling tend to be the ones who see it for what is; slightly absurd, occasionally lucrative, and just a stage you pass through on the way to something entirely different. The ones who flame out spectacularly are the ones who chase the ephemeral thing itself; a constantly unattainable level of security at the top of a subjective industry defined by its insatiable desire for what’s next. “The people who are the most mentally stable and ‘successful’ in modelling tend to be the ones who see it for what is; slightly absurd, occasionally lucrative, and just a stage you pass through on the way to something entirely different” I was scouted by a magazine editor when I was DJing at a sparsely attended party in Hong Kong. I shot some editorials and then did nothing about it, until a few years later when I was a bit lost and wanted to find a flexible job that might still give me time to write and figure out what I actually wanted to do. The editorials and a few freelance things I’d done here and there were enough to build a rudimentary book and sign with a decent agency. I then went through the typical grind of building a more rounded book by doing test-shoots with up and coming photographers and taking those shots to go-sees and castings. I never blew up as a model, but I did make some money – which if you Google ‘modelling’ and ‘debt’ you’ll see is an achievement. I saw myself on a billboard, I shot with a Victoria’s Secret model and I booked two international campaigns, but I was a lightyear away from being a household name. I was a working model, with castings as my 9-5. That I didn’t ‘make it’ doesn’t invalidate the experience – I’d argue it gave me a unique insight into the nuts and bolts of the industry, stripped away from the dominant narratives that often come to define the way we talk about it. For me, modelling was a window into the liminal state of ambition. Modelling is to be in pursuit of a life that doesn’t really exist, one of easy fame and easy fortune, predicated on nothing more than a winning smile and a body that responds well to conditioning and diet. Fame and fortune don’t come easily unless you happen to be one of the new crop of today’s supermodels which, thanks to social media, include Kim Kardashian’s sister, Stephen Baldwin’s daughter, Johnny Depp’s daughter, Cindy Crawford’s daughter, Cindy Crawford’s son, Lionel Richie’s daughter, Lenny Kravitz’s daughter – and so on. Even then they don’t come easily as such, because they were already there. And let’s not forget that success now requires the constant attention and management demanded by the logics of a 24/7 digital marketplace. Considering the progeny of the rich and famous are numerous and well connected, they are in direct competition with eachother, and therefore still struggle along like the rest of us (kind of). For those models who did somehow claw their way to the top without being nepotised there off the back of a falling star, they tend to find themselves at the height of their careers with many of the same anxieties as those just starting out – albeit with less debt and more Instagram followers. Modelling was to always be in pursuit of a gilded dream from casting to casting, all the while navigating a world that was extremely harsh and unforgiving. One time at a casting in New York I saw a model asked to take his top off to take a polaroid. He was covered in little red welts. The casting director, in front of 20 other models, asked him why he hadn’t done anything about them. They’re mosquito bites, the model said. They’re bed bugs, the casting director corrected him. Burn your sheets, burn your clothes and never come to one of my castings again because otherwise I’ll have to burn the collection. The model lived in an apartment he rented, above market-rate, from his agency. And so it was – the constant striving punctuated by the niggling reminders of the reality around you. But it had its moments; modelling is absurd, hilarious and bizarre and if you don’t take yourself too seriously then ending up posing for a lookbook in a shirt made entirely of hundreds of sleeves is actually not such a bad way to scrape a living. It beats watercooler chats with Brenda from accounts. There is also something to be said for being told no to your face hundreds of times or being entirely ignored by a casting director you’ve waited over an hour in line to see, as a way to very quickly bring you back down to earth and to grow a significantly tougher skin. It also, in the harshest way possible, taught me self acceptance. Over the course of two years I had every part of my appearance critiqued – hair too long, hair too short, eyebrows too thick, eyebrows too thin, nose too pointy, nose too wide – to the point that it came full circle and I realised that if everything was wrong, then maybe nothing was too. “Over the course of two years I had every part of my appearance critiqued – hair too long, hair too short, eyebrows too thick, eyebrows too thin, nose too pointy, nose too wide – to the point that it came full circle and I realised that if everything was wrong, then maybe nothing was too” And so, over the next few weeks, I’ll offer up some stories from modelling that I think provide a different window into three issues that I feel every model faces today – social media, weight, and defining success. I also picked these topics because they are issues of our particular moment that transcend modelling, ones that I guess we’re all trying to work through. I choose to stay anonymous because the people in my stories didn’t know they would one day come to be written about, and I’m not here to call anyone out (and also because D&G never got me a proper Chinese work visa – thanks Stefano). I also think that in a world where everyone is accessible on social media and life is so heavily curated for the purposes of a personal brand, it might be nice to read something less tethered to a particular individual. It doesn’t really matter who I am; this is just some stuff I’ve seen. Instead, I think of this as a love letter to the dreamers I met, the people who put themselves out there and grasped for something that was always, for the vast majority, just out of reach. That something is out of reach doesn’t invalidate the pursuit. I met A– on a job in Shanghai. He told me he’d been working at Tesco when a fellow cashier had told him to go to Oxford Street because there would be modelling scouts there and A–, in possession of cheekbones and standing at 190cm with no body fat, was a shoo-in to get picked. A– scoffed, but the next time the two had a day off that overlapped the other cashier dragged him to central London. And, yeah, A– laughed, guess what, outside of Topshop I ended up scouted by an agent from Milan. He looked around at the giant shopping mall we’d found ourselves in – all glistening Chinese technofuture – and smiled, and said, and now look where I am.

"Back in July 2017, a disturbing video that appeared to feature designer and A$AP Mob co-founder A$AP Bari sexually harassing a woman in London surfaced on Instagram. The video itself shows Bari – real name Jabari Shelton – talking to a naked woman in a hotel room, pulling the bedsheets off her and saying: “You fucked my assistant, now you’re going to suck my dick”. The woman – who refers to her harasser as ‘Bari’, runs out of the room crying. Following the release of the video, Bari said in a now-deleted tweet that it was “fake” and “edited”, but the video led to Nike (who previously collaborated with his VLONE label) cutting ties with him, and his eventual arrest on two counts of sexual assault on May 16. Unlike the sportswear giant, Bari still appeared on the front row of both Alyx and Dior Man’s SS19 shows in June last year, prompting people to question the industry’s stance on the #MeToo movement. Now, despite previously denying all claims, Bari has admitted to one count of sexual assault at the Old Bailey today. Appearing outside the courthouse wearing a balaclava, according to the Press Association, Bari was fined £4,000 and made to pay both the victim and the court £2,500. When ruling, the judge unsurprisingly said Bari had a “very unpleasant attitude” towards women.

"Right now, it seems like everybody’s talking about Leon Dame: the model who strode… no, waded… no, jolted… no, contorted down the runway at the Margiela show in Paris two days ago. Shooting Edward Enninful a crazed look, going viral on social media, and, according to many a shocked source, actually making Anna Wintour smile, Dame is fashion’s new walking wonder. This isn’t the first time Margiela has, to quote Marie Kondo, sparked joy. Cast your mind back to 2015 and you might recall the half-walking, half-running models that graced its runway, who subsequently ended up at the centre of countless memes about gays on their way to get iced coffee (iconic, tbh). But what is it about these walks that excites us so much, that cracks the lips of even the most steely editors? Really, it’s because we’re all narcissistic attention seekers, and we’re all secretly desperate to pace those catwalks ourselves: we want to bounce like Gisele, create wind like Tyra, to make Anna Wintour (almost) lol like Leon. But what does it take to go down in the history books as someone who could walk really, really well? Here, we aim to find out, and, in the process, provide you with a little inspiration, as we narrow down the ten must-imitate walks of all time. From Naomi and Teddy, to Tyra and Devon, get ready world: because here they are. If Naomi’s walk could talk it would say “fucking move bitch”. If Naomi’s walk were a season, it would be hurricane season. If Naomi’s walk were a former head of state it would be Beyoncé. Because when you see Naomi’s walk you see true power, and the world and its ills are for a moment forgotten, and you’re sucked into what can only be described as a Naomi-high: one filled with glory, beauty, power, a thrown mobile phone, and pure, unbridled talent. As progenitor of ‘create your own wind’ and ‘smize’, mother of America’s Next Top Model, and author of critically absurd novel Modelland, Tyra’s walk truly could not have been anything other than one for the ages. Watch carefully as she twirls lightness and brightness onto the runway – smizing so hard she might, indeed, melt your entire body were you to make direct eye contact with her. But then, with a runway coach extraordinaire like Miss Jay Alexander, how could she not steal the show every damn time? As the daughter of bonafide legend Pat, Anna is what happens when you live a life amidst fashion and unbridled glamour. Her dedication to the art of the dramatic walk is something which both exalts fashion, and makes any other fashion model look like they’re basically on a comedown after a heavy weekend. Whether Gaultier or at the couturier, Anna consistently serves up high-glamour-drama-to-the-point-of-near-heart-attack – like a little lamb inside a swan’s body. J’adore. Remember in 1997 when Sophie Dahl walked the runway and sent shockwaves through the industry because she was literally a size 12? Well, we’ve come a long way, as evidenced by her then quote in the Independent: “my grandma thinks I’m grotesque.” But we don’t. Instead we stan a queen who strode down the runway with more might and light than her heroin chic counterparts could have ever conveyed at the time. The poster girl for happiness, her short stint as top model still inspires today. Literally choke me Devon Aoki. Known as the shortest model to ever walk Chanel, Devon let nothing stop her from reaching the dizzying heights of being fashion’s biggest and most iconic, as she stormed down the runway demonstrating the kind of resting bitch face that would put Medusa to shame. Her grace, mixed with her brilliantly brutal presence, meant she could carry off an ankle-wrap cork wedge, or an entirely sheer black number at Jeremy Scott. Eyes down, head rolling, limbs often akimbo, Aoki rarely (if ever) gave a shit – and fashion could not help but stan. As Camille said in season two of ANTM, “This is my signature walk and this is the walk that’s gonna make me famous,” – seemingly, Vaquera were watching, given season after season their cast of NY cool kids trudge down the runway, dramatically mocking the kind of stiff, dead-behind-the-eyes runway walks we’ve all come to know and love (well, know). Like all New Yorkers, these people have places to be – though where those places are we have no idea. The Bounce is a hard walk to pull off, unless you’re fashion royalty like Gisele. That bounce has taken her across the world, onto every cover, to every runway ever. If you watch closely, it’s all about the hips and the hair – when the hip swings right, literally every hair on her head bounces in rhythm. Her walk is more like a dance, a dance which strikes both fear and shivers of pure joy in the hearts of baby models and fashion gays everywhere. Unlike Gisele, Veronica Webb is all about the fluidity – arms static, head matching the gait of her hips, rolling about. An oft-overlooked 90s superstar, Webb’s end of runway pose is one for the headlines: bam, turn, bam, turn again, look at the photographers, change the hair, bam, turn, then saunter off and Make! Them! Watch! Pat Cleveland rose to fame in the 60s, as one of the first African American supermodels to grace the global runways. With an intense gait, and high octane energy, Pat’s twirls and swirls would make even the most fashion-cynical scream with orgasmic glee. Less of a walk and more of a dance, Pat attains pure Fashion Darling status. I mean, just Google it: ‘Pat Cleveland, Runway Dance’ and stare agog as she literally matadors down the runway at a range of ages and intensities. This is the fashion you dreamed of when you were alone in your room in Lancaster, carefully framing a small Harvey Nichols carrier bag so that people would think you were really chic — a word which you used to pronounce ‘chick’. Already a runway legend at the tender age of baby, the trick to Teddy Quinlivan’s power walk is all in the eyes. Chin down, just a touch, and look ahead is if your dreams are at the end of the runway and only you can take them and only you take them by snapping the knee, staring directly at them, as you batter the runway with your heeled foot. Whether at Louis Vuitton, or clapping back at haters trying to grab her hat in the street, Teddy’s walk is all about it intensity, focus, and drive. Get it Teddy, get it.

"Since its launch in 2014, the LVMH Prize has become the most prestigious award for rising fashion designers. Past winners of the main prize (a casual €300,000 and a year’s worth of expert mentoring) include Marine Serre and Grace Wales Bonner, while Simon Porte Jacquemus and Hood By Air’s Shayne Oliver count among the Special Prize winners. This year, the nominees feature a line-up of some of London’s best young designers, including Kiko Kostadinov, Richard Malone, and Stefan Cooke, but there’s a lot more to the list than just the Brits. Here are five new names to get familiar with. “The vagina pants have put me on the radar,” says Duran Lantink, the Dutch designer behind those now-iconic pink vulva pants sported by Janelle Monae. That’s definitely not all you need to know him for, though – the nominee has one of the most exciting and original approaches to the idea of sustainable fashion right now. His clothes are entirely made from reworked garments left over from end-of-season sales – a lighthearted, playful take on upcycling which has seen him glue Balenciaga boots inside Miu Miu heels, stitch a Marques’Almeida blouse to a Vetements polo shirt, add vintage Gaultier sleeves to a Helmut Lang jacket. “This all originated from my frustration with mass production in high-end fashion and the culture of sales,” Lantink says. “With my concerns about overconsumption, I would like to have an open discussion about brands’ responsibility on textile waste.” These fashion bootlegs – and the idea of cutting up even the most sacred of labels – prompt some serious questions about just what we revere when it comes to designer clothing. “In general I hope to change how people value products. Fusing luxury brands into unique pieces is a form of counterfeiting.” Lantink also wants to use his work to tell the stories of communities pretty far from the fashion world – like Sistaah Hood, a transgender sex workers community based in Cape Town, who he cast in a project with photographer Jan Hoek. “We created outfits from the things we found on the streets in Cape Town! We are hoping to do a fashion show as that is their biggest dream. For me, it’s important to collaborate with different communities so they can tell their stories. It teaches me more about life, and it’s good to let them know they’re seen and respected by people.” Future plans include building an AI program to help combine deadstock into new pieces, but first, he’s thrilled to be in the running for the LVMH Prize: “It’s a perfect opportunity to show the people in the fashion industry what I stand for.” @duranlantinkyo “The most important thing that I learned from CSM is that we always hold complete freedom to be able to do anything we desire – if we can imagine the image in our mind we can create it in real life,” says London-based designer Susan Fang. She’s not kidding – to create her intricate weaved pieces, she’s had to develop new tools each season physically capable of knitting them. “What inspired me the most was to invent new design and new ways of making or perceiving clothing,” she explains. The designer, who grew up between China, Canada, the USA, and England, taps mathematics as a key source of inspiration – in particular fractals, patterns that are complex yet precise. “I wanted to replicate that in clothing; rhythm, movement, yet linked by a repeated concept,” Fang says. “Thus I created air-weave. By switching the perspective of traditional weaving, the air-weave is completely free to grow in three dimensions instead of just 2D. It is able to have life, and is able to move, stretch, and swim between dimensions, and has freedom in the expression of colour as it constantly changes through body movement.” The idea of a wearer is key for Fang – the garments can stretch to accommodate different body sizes, and are only really complete when worn. Beyond industry recognition, being nominated for the prize is an opportunity for Fang to meet her fellow designers. “I always feel like such an outsider of fashion and just overly concentrated on my creations, so I’m excited to meet and hear from them!” @susanfangofficial From music to fashion and even skateboarding, there is serious noise coming from the Nigerian city of Lagos right now. Designer Kenneth Ize is certainly contributing to it. “At the moment fashion in Lagos is one of the focal points of the growing local design and arts scene which makes it an exciting time to be working here,” says the designer, a graduate of the University of Applied Arts in Vienna. “People who may have moved abroad before are staying in Nigeria and building a new cultural infrastructure which I believe will be followed by larger institutional projects.” His colourful, handwoven suits are a signature, and he’s already had his pieces worn by Childish Gambino and Naomi Campbell. For Ize, technique is paramount – the clothes are made using traditional Nigerian weaving, a skilled craft but one under threat of fading away. “The brand focuses on reinterpreting examples of Nigerian and West African artisanship to create an original perspective on luxury production within textile and fashion,” Ize says. “We work with a community of weavers, and also with a variety of artisan and design groups, merging a contemporary design aesthetic and new production skills with a specifically local handcraft practice.” He says the nomination for the LVMH Prize is both encouraging and humbling – and a reminder that he now has other expectations to live up to beyond his own. Plans for the future centre around fostering a community of craftspeople. “At home in Lagos we want to build out the infrastructure surrounding the weavers and other artisans, to develop our existing techniques and explore new ones not only in Nigeria but in the broader West African region. It is important for us to show the artisanal techniques which exist here and to support the communities of artisans which continue these traditions.” @kennethize Although Caroline Hu’s father painted when she was younger before going on to pursue a career in business, the New York-based designer also credits an art teacher as an influential figure in her creative development. The connections make sense when you look at her work, where dresses inspired by Renaissance masterpieces more closely resemble vivid bursts of colour and texture boldly breaking free of their canvasses than traditional garments. With fabrics layered and smocked, some pieces include up to 20 different materials – yet remain impressively lightweight. But the inspiration for her creations – which she honed at both Central Saint Martins in London and Parsons in New York – also comes from within. “I always like to meditate, and think about myself, my own story, and my feelings,” she says. “My designs are my personal emotional expression (of) some moments… The process is sometimes tormented, but when the expression of the work turns out right, I’m really happy.” Hu, who made her debut with a presentation at NYFW where models sat around reading or busied themselves painting in front of easels, hopes to continue growing the business side of the brand along with the artistic one – and which her nomination will certainly help with. “The LVMH Prize is such a significant and rare experience for me,” she says. @carolineqiqi Having two pairs of hands rather than just one is pretty useful when it comes to starting a fashion label, as designers Choi Kanghyuk and Sanglak Shon have discovered. The two met and became friends at the Royal College of Art, which is also where the starting point for their brand was developed in KangHyuk’s MA graduate collection, which made use of car airbags – something that’s become a signature for KangHyuk. “I was interested in the purity of the nylon airbag and how it works in terms of creating seams and wearability,” the designer explains. “Our design process focuses on utilising materials in their purest form, while looking at mass produced taste in real life and juggling the balance between materiality and concept.” If making clothes from car airbags sounds complicated, that’s because it is. “In the specific case of the airbag material, that a majority of our collections so far have been made with, we need to first source the unused airbags in different parts of the world, then we manually extract the oxygen metal chamber, which is a very physical procedure,” the designer explains. “From there we unpick the fabric by hand and try use the original patterns of the fabric as they are, via utilising a computerised process to jig-saw the pieces together.” The result is, perhaps surprisingly, aesthetically strong – and has so far earned them launches and installations at London’s Machine-A, H. Lorenzo in LA, and made in-store bespoke installations at Comme des Garçons Trading Museum and Dover Street Market. You might also have seen them on A$AP Rocky – the Fashion Killa wore a full look in his recent “Tony Tone” video. @_kanghyuk Models: Shunjing @ NEXT, Eniola @ NEXT, Nika C @ New Madison, and Thiam @ BANANAS.

"When you ignore all the terrible effects it has on a lot of people’s mental health, Instagram is a pretty great place. Take the Explore page – one minute you could be looking at a video of miniature cooking, and the next, a handy DIY tip of how to turn a watermelon into its own self-contained juice dispenser. Don’t even get us started on the obsessive slime community. Among the viral videos gaining traction recently are extreme nail art tutorials. OK, so black women have been bedazzling their nails and pushing them to extreme lengths for years – shoutout to Jazz Ison Sinkfield, who has grown her nails to an impressive 24 inches over the course of 22 years (still not the world record holder though) – but now they’ve made it to the mainstream. “In my world and culture, people have always been interested in nail art.” explains nail artist Gracie J. “Black women have been rocking crazy unwearable nails for decades – when it was considered unkempt or ghetto. The decadent charms, the crazy lengths and curves. You know, hood aesthetics.” You might think pointy acrylic nails are the limit of this unsung body accessory, but these viral videos prove that the potential for nail art is pretty much limitless. “Instagram has pretty much catapulted nail art into the mainstream,” nail artist Tee Fisher (behind account @nailgurl) tells us. “I think that more artists aren't afraid to push the envelope in regards to their art.” Fisher’s account regularly sees claw creations that look like cigarette butts, skulls, and even It’s Pennywise the Clown. More than just for likes, Fisher also features politically-charged nails too – mostly notably, caricatures of Trump, Mike Pence, Steve Bannon, and Kellyanne Conway. Gracie J also favours nails with a message, including designs supporting “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” repeal, the No H8 campaign, and even a likeness of Marsha P Johnson. “I believe that while we all share the love of nail art (whoever you are) it’s also important for black women to take back ownership of their bodies, their culture, their aesthetics. It is important for us to change the narrative that’s been dictated for us by other people outside of us. When it comes to one account nailing (sorry, not sorry) the game, Russian-based artist @nail_sunny is probably the most talon-ted (again, not sorry) – with 1.8 million followers to prove it. Anything, and we literally mean anything you can think of has been immortalised in nail form on the account. Crayons that can actually write, braces, 3D eyeballs, fake amber fossils with real mosquitoes inside. If your mind wasn’t already blown, nothing tops a miniature golden cherub fountain that actually spouts water from its tiny miniature penis. As Fisher puts it: “Nail art will never go back to the era of modesty!” Beyond Instagram (because there is life outside of social media) some of the artists are bringing nail art to the runway. New York-based Japanese artist Mei Kawajiri brought her skills to Balenciaga’s SS17 show – adorning the pink and red acrylics with diamantés. At the 2017 CFDA Awards, Demna Gvasalia collected the International Award with a fast food logo manicure. Burger King, KFC, and Pizza Hut – but make it fashion. Unofficially, she’s created nails on her account for Comme des Garçons, Off-White, and the recent Dior Man x KAWS collab. “I think nails are more fashionable than clothing,” Kawajiri tells us. “It’s a way to show your unique style, like a tattoo, but more casual.” Speaking of unique, nobody is doing what Juan Alvear (@nailsbyjuan.nyc) is doing – pushing nail art in a surreal direction. His often alien-like creations often feature horns, spikes, and interlocking designs. He nods to fashion too, with his latest unwearable creations reimagining the ugly sneaker trend – he’s already done Gucci’s crystal-covered creation and a pair from Acne Studios’ SS19 show, but Balenciaga Triple S, WYA? “My work stands out from typical nail art because I don’t usually go by the book when it comes to a traditional nail shape,” Alvear explains. “The main rule I do try to follow is that it fits on the nail bed and even then that’s more of a guideline.” With Instagram’s extreme nail art constantly snatching your cuticles’ wigs, who knows where it will go next. “I am noticing more and more elaborate nail art being showcased, so it will be only bigger and better as time goes on,” says Kawajiri. If you want to get into it yourself, you know where to start. You’ll be nailing it before you know it.

"Where Clare Waight Keller’s Givenchy-wearing models go, you can bet there will be an architecturally stunning backdrop. After taking over a country manor for the house’s Pre-Fall 2018 collection, the set for the resort 2019 collection is a series of 70s-style settings. Produced under the direction of Waight Keller, the retro-style video – shot on Super-8 film – features looks from the collection that contrast the environment. From a flowing rainbow-coloured dress backdropped with Brutalist concrete, or a variety of tropical looks inside a muted living room setting. For all Givenchy fans out there, the good news is that the house has upped its amount of collections to include two additional standalone menswear shows – Celine followed suit yesterday – with the first presentation taking place during PFW in January.

"Despite announcing his hiatus from fashion earlier this summer, it seems Virgil Abloh is back to business as usual. With the upcoming season fast approaching, last month the designer posted a photo of himself in the Louis Vuitton lifts in Paris, meaning it’s highly likely he’s set to make a return to fashion for AW20. Fashion isn’t the only thing taking up the Abloh’s time, though, and if you thought he might be easing himself back into work you’d be wrong, given it has just been revealed he will debut an exhibition in Paris next year. Announcing on social media that he has been signed with the international gallery Galerie kreo, his first exhibition with the institution will be titled “efflorescence”, and is set to centre around concrete blocks, focusing on the concept of paradoxes. A utilitarian feature of any urban city, the designer will look at the graffiti which often decorates these blocks or the wildflowers which can sometimes grow between the accidental holes which form in them. The result will be an exhibition which explores the ways in which the rigidity of structures and urban planning meets the randomness of organic growth and human mark-making. This show follows on from Abloh’s major retrospective at the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, which took place earlier this summer. Titled Figures of Speech, the exhibition documented Abloh’s designs, from his work at Nike and Ikea, to his creations at Off-White. “efflorescence” will take place from January 15 to April 10 at Galerie kreo.

"While the use of fur in fashion has been an ongoing conversation for years, recently the heat seems to have turned up. During the AW18 shows there were protests outside Marc Jacobs during NYFW (even though the designer had only used faux fur), with one protestor even storming the runway at Mary Katrantzou’s show in London (she also didn’t use any real fur). The latest designer to join the ranks of those going fur-free is Donatella Versace. In an interview for 1843 magazine, she said: “Fur? I am out of that. I don’t want to kill animals to make fashion. It doesn’t feel right.” The news is big for the Italian house – that is known for its amped-up glamour – as it has used fur for years. A quick search of Versace’s website only appears to reveal one mink-collared coat, however. Donatella is not the only designer to go fur-free recently. Gucci also announced that it would no longer be using fur in its collections – something it upheld at its recent AW18 show. Tom Ford and Michael Kors also announced they would be ditching the material after using it for years, while faux fur featured prominently on Givenchy’s runway this season. As conversations around the use of the controversial material continue, there will likely be others who will join Donatella in going fur-free in the future. UPDATE: the International Fur Federation’s CEO Mark Oaten responded to Versace with the following statement: “I am very disappointed to hear that Versace has said they won’t use real fur in collections. The majority of top designers will continue to work with fur as they know it is a natural product that is produced responsibly. With growing concern about the environment and plastics in fashion, I truly believe fur is the natural and responsible choice for designers and consumers.”

"Last week, Copenhagen Fashion Week took place, with the majority of designers putting out the minimal designs you’d expect from the Scandi scene. One designer who decided to look at things from a different perspective was Reza Etamadi of label MUF10. In response to a law passed a few days before the show, Etamadi staged a protest against the burqa ban with his collection. “No man should be the judge of what a woman chooses to wear,” the designer said in a statement. “We should not sanction a woman who neither threatens nor inflicts damage on others simply because of her garments.” The show itself featured Arabic slogan sweatshirts, as well as hijabi models. The biggest statement came at the end of the show where niqab-wearing women appeared and gave bunches of flowers to a group dressed like policemen. The recently passed law states that “anyone who wears a garment that hides the face in public will be punished with a fine” with a woman already being charged this month. “In Iran, where I was born, women are fighting for the right to choose what to wear,” Etamadi says. “They are fighting for freedom with their lives on the line because, what we see as a basic human right, society and politicians view as a reactionary movement that threatens their beliefs.” While there have been protests against the newly passed law, there has been no mention of the ban being revoked by the Danish government.

"Vetements’ trademark is for subverting the fashion industry’s ways of doing things. Following its recent return to the runway after a short one season break, designer Demna Gvasalia has unveiled his latest project. Mirroring its takeover of New York department store Saks’ windows last July, its installation will inhabit Harrods’ windows from February 8-March 2. As before, both employees and members of the public are being invited to donate their old clothes to become part of the displays. The installation takes a stand against fast fashion – staged as a reaction to the large-scale waste fashion creates – illustrating how preloved garments should be given a second life. Anyone contributing clothing – via the clothes bank displays fixed within the exhibition windows – will receive an exclusive VETEMENTS HARRODS wristband made from 100 per cent recycled plastic bottles to commemorate their participation in the project. In addition, proceeds will be donated to NSPCC, a longtime charity partner of Harrods. Gvasalia plans to run 50 more of the installations around the globe throughout the year. More recently, Vetements took the third spot on a list of 2017’s ‘hottest fashion brands’, while Balenciaga, where Gvasalia was appointed artistic director in 2015, came in at second place. The VETEMENTS HARRODS installation will run from February 8-March 2 at Harrods on Brompton Road, Knightsbridge, SW1X 7XL

"Streetwear brand MISBHV has, in a considerably short time, positioned itself at the forefront of the emerging Polish fashion scene. With each passing season, lead designer Natalia Maczek and creative director Thomas Wirski further establish themselves as ones to watch, but last week they reached a considerable milestone. As part of its first ever catwalk show, instead of venturing out to established fashion meccas like Paris or New York, the brand chose to debut its SS19 collection on its beloved home turf in Warsaw. This season, the duo pulled inspiration from what they call “the golden age of Polish culture”, the 60s and 70s. Wirski cited two overt references: Roman Polanski’s film Knife in the Water and the rich heritage of Polish poster design, epitomised in the work of internationally acclaimed artist Rosław Szaybo. Collaborating with Szaybo, the collection incorporating his text and designs manifested in a series of prints. As for the clothes themselves, MISBHV staples, like early 00s, faux-luxury prints, headscarves, techno-turtlenecks, and unexpected neon colours were matched with a number of more mature garments, namely in the form of tailored styles and distinguished formal wear. The reimagining and remixing of this significant branch of Poland’s visual history made for a future-forward presentation which simultaneously paid honorary respect to who and what came before them. When it came to the show itself, guests were ushered up a marble staircase and into a smoky, atmospheric room. The show opened with a performance that fused traditional Polish folk dancing (and garb) with an experimental, industrial soundtrack. The brutal clash between tradition and innovation, set inside the echoing hall of a Soviet tower, was a sensory meditation on the contradictions which define the present. It felt distinguished, proving that elegance and the underground are not mutually exclusive. The afterparty at Jasna 7 featured a candlelit, crypt-like dancefloor, with a DJ set by Wirski himself. The evening wasn’t just a showcase of MISBHV’s latest work, it was a showcase of Warsaw’s emerging creative class – the vibrant community that Maczek and Wirski began designing for in the first place. Those familiar with the MISBHV ethos can affirm that showing in their native Poland is by far the most appropriate choice. Amid the wave of post-Soviet hype, MISBHV has harnessed the vigour of their heritage to differentiate themselves from lookalikes and copycats. Polish identity, history and experience form the backbone of the brand’s aesthetic, and both the duo’s recent collection and method of presentation stand in strong testament to that fact. “Fashion was practically non-existent in the 2000s. With no fashion schools or designers to look up to, the brand grew organically, outside the system, from the clubs to the streets” – Natalia Maczek and Thomas Wirski Speaking to Maczek and Wirski about their upbringing in post-Communist Poland, it’s evident how much power MISBHV has in shaping a new Polish aesthetic, and the world’s perception of it. “Fashion was practically non-existent in the 2000s. With no fashion schools or designers to look up to, the brand grew organically, outside the system, from the clubs to the streets”, Maczek and Wirski explained. The two are a part of a generation born from the ashes of 50 years of Soviet rule, when fashion as a concept was virtually wiped off the map. Their greatest challenge is also their greatest freedom, forging a visual language and method of dress that reflects the complexities of contemporary Polish identity. At such a politically tumultuous time, aesthetics have far greater meaning than what’s merely surface level. The rise of the far-right in Poland has bred complicated feelings toward Polish nationalism, making MISBHV’s cultural homage to Poland all the more pressing. Maczek and Wirski artistically celebrated their heritage with nuance and consideration, which served as a reminder to the outside world that the rise of the far-right in Poland is by no means a reflection of Polishness. The SS19 show proves, more than anything, that the two have set out to do far more than design edgy, eastern clubwear. Maczek and Wirski explain, “The history, philosophy and language of MISBHV explicitly reflect the values which we would like to associate with modern-day Poland: tolerance, freedom, beauty and solidarity – all that Polish jazz.”

"For the last couple of years, we’ve seen runways and Insta-feeds drowned in millennial pink, a baby pink meets salmon shade which offers an ‘un-girly’ take on the infamous hue. But, as of recently, millennial pink is all but dead and gone. Now, according to basically every fashion publication, it’s time for ‘Gen Z yellow’ to shine. It all started when Beyoncé smashed up her trifling lover’s car in that Cavalli dress, and then escalated when Kylie Jenner ate a banana wearing a yellow crop top. It was at this point, in August of last year, that fashion blog Man Repeller coined the term, using it as a catch-all to describe a variety of shades ranging from mustard to sunshine. Since then, ‘Gen Z yellow’ has worked its way into every trend report that matters. But why, and what does it mean? According to trend forecaster and fashion lecturer Louise Stuart Trainor, the colour’s popularity lies in its various, maleable connotations – she argues it can be linked to the sun and “easy vibes” just as easily as it can be to depression and anxiety. According to Trainor, the colour’s various messages are contradictory and hard to put in a box: “yellow is a difficult colour to pin down, and so is Gen Z.” She’s not wrong: today’s youth are more fluid, more resistant, and undeniably queerer than ever before. But the complexity of this argument rarely rings through trend pieces listing the hottest ‘Gen Z yellow’ nail polishes, which often come across as nothing more than a frenzied attempt to make arbitrary links between fashion and culture in the name of commerce. “The desire to capture the spirit of youth and to understand younger generations’ motivation is driven by both curiosity and commerciality,” says Trainor. She cites a generational gap between researchers and their subjects: “Older researchers find it difficult to capture the qualities of the next generation and to compare them to their own, because they seem so different. They want to quantify these qualities in order to package goods and sell them to young people.” “The desire to capture the spirit of youth and to understand younger generations’ motivation is driven by both curiosity and commerciality” – Louise Stuart Trainor Collating personal data for financial gain is one thing, but the recent Guardian profile of whistleblower Christopher Wylie showed that motives can be more sinister. While studying for a PhD in fashion trend forecasting, Wylie came up with a plan to create hundreds of thousands of psychological profiles of people based on their Facebook pages. This led to the creation of data analytics company Cambridge Analytica, which subsequently became the “psychological warfare mindfuck tool” (as described by Wylie himself) that he says was partly responsible for the election of Trump and the success of Brexit. By manipulating the language of trend forecasting and demographic profiles, Wylie built a powerful weapon which effectively undermined democracy and exposed repeated data regulation policy breaches by Facebook. That said, without even taking the Cambridge Analytica fallout into account, the amount of legally collected information that exists about us as individuals is difficult to comprehend: a quick look through Dylan Curran’s informative Twitter thread highlights just how much of our data is silently recorded. Forecasting harmless trends like ‘Gen Z yellow’ is one thing, but it’s worrying to see how effectively Wylie parlayed his skills into brainwashing voters. Like politics, fashion is all about convincing consumers by sending a series of subtle messages over a period of time. Wylie makes the surprising but fitting parallel between Trump and Uggs, or Crocs: “How do you get from people thinking, ‘Ugh. Totally ugly’ to the moment when everyone is wearing them?” Fashion fans will notice that both styles have made unexpected appearances at Sacai, Y/Project, and Balenciaga in recent seasons, with the latter's ('Gen Z Yellow') iteration a shock sell-out upon its release in January. According to Wylie, it all comes down to identifying the early adopters. “If you can find them, then you can start a trend,” he explained to the House of Commons in a mammoth four-hour long meeting this week. Speaking to Dazed, Wylie broke down how he went from forecasting fashion to building psychological profiles of people based on their data. “I looked at personality traits because we often use the same kinds of words to describe our style as we would our personality, and I wanted to unpack that and see if there was anything to that,” he said. Turns out, there was – different personality traits pointed towards a preference for different brands. It was this research that went on to inform his work with Cambridge Analytica, where “psychological warfare” tactics were employed to influence people’s mindset and decisions based on the content they engaged with on Facebook. “If you actually like yellow, then great – wear it. But in a time when our personalities and habits are being studied and the results leveraged against us to such a far-reaching and potentially dangerous extent, it’s worth examining our desires and our own personal style in order to continually maintain our autonomy” There will likely be consumers swung by the persuasive language of ‘Why You Need To Buy An Entirely Gen Z Yellow Wardrobe Like Right Now’ related content – as well as brands making everything in the shade. If you actually like yellow, then great – wear it. But in a time when our personalities and habits are being studied and the results leveraged against us to such a far-reaching and potentially dangerous extent, it’s worth examining our desires and our own personal style in order to continually maintain our autonomy. Do we seriously need to buy everything in a colour just because some experts have told us it's So Hot Right Now? Probably not. With trends like these, it’s like the old metaphor of the chicken and the egg – there’s a link between cause and effect. The coverage of millennial pink sent its popularity soaring, meaning it became huge because people said it would. It might seem tempting to succumb to ‘Gen Z yellow’, but like everything in fashion, its reign will be both cyclical and pre-determined by industry experts. It’s likely that, in 12 months’ time, the hue will be just as dead as millennial pink is now.

"Pharrell Williams is all about good vibes – peace, love and of course, happiness. This is reflected in G-Star RAW’s AW16 advertising campaign, the brand which Williams is co-owner and “Head of Imagination” of. Instead of a model or celebrity, the campaign stars G-Star’s own team and in its accompanying film seeks to “tell the story of what exists beneath the surface of the brand itself: the people that make it, their craft, and the spaces they occupy.” According to label, which is primarily known for its jeans and innovative sustainability efforts, casting these people for its AW16 campaign or “Family Portrait” reflects the brand’s “belief in equality and team effort.” Williams has been collaborating with G-Star for a number of years now, but this relationship became more official six months ago when the musician announced that he had bought a stake in the brand. “G-Star is an independently minded and forward thinking company,” he said, “I believe they will be the definitive jeans brand of the 21st century. I am looking forward to be part of that mission and to co-create G-Star’s future.”

"It’s official, fashion bootlegs aren’t going anywhere. While you might remember we coined 2016 the year of the bootleg, 2017 has seen it go one step further with meta bootlegged bootleg moments like Gucci’s homage to Dapper Dan and ‘Guccy’ sweatshirts to Ava Nirui’s Marc Jacobs collab. And just when you thought it was over with, it has re-emerged again. Unless you’ve been scrolling in the right place on Instagram, you probably will have missed some could-it-be-real-please-be-real items on @mikadololo’s account. Think Supreme x Louis Vuitton boxing gloves, ice lollies and even a hookah. Or the lesser known collaboration between Supreme and Dominos (sorry, fake news). The newest to join this group of fashion bootlegs is an Off-White-branded condom. Emblazoned with the brand’s logo and the word “SAFE” in the label’s signature double quote marks, you can almost believe it being something it would create. And what better way to stop the spread of STI’s among hypebeast fuccbois than via the (unofficial) message of Virgil Abloh? Here, we chat with creator Mikaël Barelaud Eludut about the fashion bootlegs that you’ll no doubt be desperate to get your hands on. Can you tell us about what you do? Mikaël Barelaud Eludut: I’m a 29-year-old graphic designer based in Monaco, working for an international food company creating adverts and packaging design. I learned graphic design after high school but I’ve always been passionate about graphic design, art, and obviously streetwear culture. How did you start creating fashion bootleg collaborations? Mikaël Barelaud Eludut: I started two years ago with a series of characters from Family Guy wearing Yeezy’s Season 1 collection. It was the first time I published my personal artwork on Instagram but it created some buzz. From there, I moved from drawing to photo manipulation, trying to make concept but with a realistic aspect, like ‘how would an F1 car look if the team were fashion brand?’ Where do you look for inspiration? Mikaël Barelaud Eludut: From fashion, streetwear and hip hop. I’m always looking for what would be the next trend. I don’t really search for anything in particular, just things I’m passionate about. How did you come up with the Off-White condom? Mikaël Barelaud Eludut: I saw this Off-White “Plastic Cup” and I knew I could do something with that, so I tried it with a condom, trying to do something funny. First I wanted to put “RAINCOAT” on it, but then I changed it to “SAFE” so everybody could understand. Do you have plans to collaborate with brands and create the items officially? Mikaël Barelaud Eludut: I really would like to and it’s my plan to get closer to these hype brands. I’d love for the Domino’s x Supreme collab I’ve created to be made IRL.

"While fashion is often accused of not being inclusive enough for those who aren’t super skinny and/or white, Tommy Hilfiger is trying to combat this with the announcement that it is launching an adaptive line for people with disabilities. “Inclusivity and democratisation of fashion have always been at the core of my brand’s DNA,” Hilfiger himself told InStyle. “These collections continue to build on that vision, empowering the differently abled community.” Designed with both those with disabilities and caretakers in mind, the collection consists of 34 women’s and 37 men’s styles. The pieces include magnetic closures to allow wearers to easily dress themselves, or for carers to easily dress others. Other notable features include trousers with Velcro closures, magnetic flies and zippers on top of specialised leg hems to account for leg braces and orthotics. A report published earlier this year found that one in five UK residents have some form of disability that limited their daily activities – working out at around 13.3 million people. For such a huge number of the population, this group is still largely neglected by fashion brands, even if there have been some notable moments over the years such as the signing of wheelchair-user Jillian Mercado to IMG in 2015 following her appearance in a Diesel campaign. This isn’t the American brand’s first step towards being more inclusive with its collections. Tommy Hilfiger has already released two collections for children with disabilities, partnering with Runway of Dreams – a foundation with the aim of promoting inclusivity within the fashion industry. While collections like this are a great step in the right direction for fashion, Tommy Hilfiger is sadly in the minority when it comes to this belief. Hopefully, it won’t be long before others follow suit.

"Another year, another Met Gala. This year’s pays tribute to Comme des Garçons designer Rei Kawakubo with an all-encompassing exhibition titled “Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Garçons: Art of the In-Between”. It is only the second time the Met Gala has given its Costume Institute over to a single designer, after Yves Saint Laurent’s solo show in 1983. To mark the show’s opening (as well as crowdsource some funding for the Costume Institute), celebrities came to the Met Museum in New York dressed in their finest. While there have been tricky themes set in the past (case in point: last year’s superfuturist Manus x Machina), it seems as though something as simple as Comme des Garçons’ oeuvre was too difficult to navigate for most. Kawakubo’s back catalogue of designs should’ve provided a wealth of options for anyone looking to pay homage to the ineffable designer. Here were some freebies: Still, that didn’t stop a running tally of celebrities from turning up in safe choices – chiffon gowns and unadventurous bodycon dresses. A whopping four people, according to RuPaul’s Drag Race judge Michelle Visage, turned up dressed in something related to the theme. LITERALLY four people followed this year's #MetGala theme. 4. Most iconic image from the 2017 Met Gala goes to… In an effort to self-meme, rapper-turned-mogul P Diddy got too tired of standing and taking pictures with girlfriend Cassie, so he decided to lounge on the carpeted stairs in his cape, because why not?

His look was inspired by both dracula and The Matrix, and we’re hair for it. At least one person did their homework. Rihanna came dressed in Comme’s AW16 collection. “The shoes took me an hour to get into,” she told André Leon Talley. After telling Vogue Runway that she would not be attending you may have noticed that the notoriously mysterious designer was absent from the red carpet.

"There are few relationships in fashion that have endured as long as Karl Lagerfeld and Fendi. Unbelievably, the artistic polymath was appointed as creative director of the Italian luxury house way back in 1965 and still continues to push the historic brand into a new, modern direction. This movement is visually encapsulated in the brand’s SS16 campaign, starring Texan beauty Vanessa Moody alongside Brit runway veteran Edie Campbell. In an accompanying statement, Lagerfeld claims to have chosen the girls because, despite their distinctively different aesthetics, both women successfully embody today’s fashion landscape whilst still being relatable to the Fendi woman. The final images, which can be seen in their entirety below, are shot against an exaggerated-scale replica of the graphic floral motifs that recurred throughout the house’s latest collection. The series of backstage images above also detail the process behind the campaign, providing a glimpse of Lagerfeld at work. The futuristic florals were a prominent detail throughout the SS16 collection, adorning the straps of snakeskin boots and statement handbags. Conceived as an homage to Fendi’s house codes, Lagerfeld intended SS16 as an experimentation in “new volumes, contrasts and a new femininity”. He communicated these intentions through an exploration of texture – while the house’s signature textiles fur and leather were still prominent throughout, the designer also introduced a range of softer silhouettes to lighten the mood. The collection came just months after Fendi’s SS16 ‘Haute Fourrure’ couture collection, the first in its 90-year history. Lagerfeld may have been behind the brand for over 50 years, but these signs indicate that he has no intentions of slowing down.

"JNCO, the 90s denim brand best known for its wide and ultra-baggy jeans, is coming back from the grave. Once loved by skate kids, ravers and mall rats all over suburban America, JNCO's main factory was shut down in 2000 and the phattest denim style became consigned to the trash heap of throwback fashion. Until now. WWD reports that the relaunch is led by Andrew Jacovou, the president and CEO of a China-based garment company called Guotai Litian USA. His plan is to sell a core collection, a fashion collection, and a heritage collection. ""The core collection features traditional styles including a knit jean with a slouchy fit; the fashion group has joggers with zip bottoms and a drawstring waist, and the heritage collection offers leg openings of 20 inches and 23 inches, with high waists,"" WWD states. ""All of the product will feature JNCO's crown logo."" JNCO has already launched a revamped website which promises: ""We know you’re ready to see what we have been working on…. Be patient…. It is coming."" No word yet on whether it'll bring back those wide-leg jeans with flames running up the side. The collections will be aimed at those between 18 and 35 years old. In a statement, Jacovou said that the brand will ""appeal to trendsetting men and women who wore the brand in the Nineties, as well as a new generation of consumers who will be introduced to the brand’s fashion-forward sensibilities for the first time"". Laugh all you want, but we can see this working. In the past year, the wide-leg silhouette has been worn by everyone from FKA twigs (check her out here on the cover of the Fader) to Rihanna. Just yesterday, DIS teamed up with forward-thinking denim brand 69 Worldwide to present a unisex collection featuring uber-flared culottes. Fly boys and fly girls, we hope you're ready to rock (rock rock rock) rock the microphone. Liked this?

"When John Galliano unexpectedly showed up at Oscar de la Renta's studio to work on his autumn/winter 2013 collection, tongues started wagging. Was the disgraced designer about to take over as creative director? Was this proof that the industry was ready to welcome Galliano back into the fold, two years after he was dismissed from Dior for his anti-Semitic outburst in Paris? Turns out all that speculation was unfounded: John Galliano will not be returning to the New York fashion house in a more permanent role. The reason? Money. ""It is categorically not happening,"" a source told Page Six. ""Oscar de la Renta is still looking for a new creative director. Money was the biggest factor which held up the negotiations, and they couldn’t reach an agreement,"" the source explains, ""although John and Oscar remain very good friends. John is grateful that Oscar gave him a second chance."" After their well-received autumn/winter 2013 collaboration, Galliano was widely seen as a viable candidate for creative director of Oscar de la Renta. Unfortunately, it seems that Galliano wanted backing for a large design team, as well as specialist support staff for his atelier, and de la Renta was unwilling to front the cash. It was de la Renta that gave Galliano his second chance, and reopened the door for him to step back into the fashion world after his dismissal from Dior in 2011. In early 2013, de la Renta said, ""He has worked long and hard on his recovery, and I am happy to give him the opportunity to re-immerse himself in the world of fashion and reacclimate in an environment where he has been so creative."" Where next for Galliano? So far, Galliano has been focusing on his recovery, as well as mentoring fashion students at Central Saint Martins. Last year, he spoke for the first time about his struggle to make amends for his misdeeds on the Charlie Rose show:

"Maybe you’ve seen them while scrolling on Instagram, then stopped and scrolled back in disbelief. “Them” being CGI-created models. Yep, if beauty standards weren’t yet high enough, there are now uber-perfect models who don’t really exist – even if they do have personalities and their own social media accounts. And being avatars hasn’t stopped them from being the faces of beauty labels or modelling in editorials for magazines. One of them even took over at Milan Fashion Week. Still, as you might imagine, reception to these new faces has been mixed – what do they represent? Is this just the creepy AF Pygmalion myth for generation Instagram? And what about the actual, IRL models they’re putting out of a job? Here, two writers argue for and against the use of CGI models in fashion. Text Dominic Cadogan Besides being a trillion dollar industry globally, fashion has always been about creating a world of fantasy, a way for people to escape. Look no further than the breathtaking creations of Alexander McQueen, or Comme des Garçons. Surely, the sudden takeover of CGI models is just another facet of fashion’s obsession with fantasy? Digitally created, these new faces – including Lil Miquela, Shudu, and Nfon – aren’t limited by genetics or reality; they can take any form their creators envision. To me, it’s exciting. Discovering new models with interesting features is a big part of fashion, and now the possibilities are endless. Ours is an industry constantly obsessed with pushing forward and looking to the future – remember the “robots” at Chanel, and the fashion shoot with Sophia the robot? Don’t forget that for its SS16 campaign, Louis Vuitton enlisted Final Fantasy’s Lightning to front the collection – mostly to fanfare, if you go by the comments on the Instagram post. This feels like a natural next step. The most recognisable name among this new wave of models is probably Lil Miquela. Since her first selfie back in 2016, she has now featured in shoots, took over Prada’s Instagram at its AW18 show, and modelled for Pat McGrath’s make-up line. Not to mention the fact she’s amassed just under a million followers on Instagram. It’s hard to ignore the hype – also, she just looks fucking cool with her bangs, Princess Leia-esque buns, and freckled cheeks. Really, she’s just like us – when she isn’t infiltrating fashion, she spends her time taking selfies and hanging out with her equally-cool, but actually real friends. She also has a boyfriend – another CGI model, who got a sprinkle more fuccboi in the mix than his other half. At a quick glance, he’s like any other hypebeast, covering his face for selfies, and posting (terrible) memes on his Instagram account. See, they’re not so different to us. To hate them just because they’re holding a mirror up to the hyperreal, social-media obsessed state of society right now is ridiculous. They didn’t create the conditions that allowed for them to flourish, we did. “Shouldn’t we be celebrating the fact that a dark-skinned, black woman is gaining popularity in fashion – even if she isn’t real?” – Dominic Cadogan On a surface level, people might argue that the invention of fake CGI models signals the end of the modelling industry as we know it, and that “real” models will soon be out of jobs. This isn’t the case. E-commerce sites have photoshopped clothes onto digital bodies for years – but from catwalks to campaigns, actual models still get hired. More seriously, there are those suggesting the creation of these CGI models is cultural appropriation. Particularly the photographer behind Shudu – described on her IG account as the World’s First Digital Supermodel – since he is white, and male. Yes, it is problematic. Particularly as her likeness comes from models like Duckie Thot and Alek Wek, making it hard not to seem like fetishisation. But for those suggesting her creator is profiting from her, they are way off the mark. Shudu was never created for commercial reasons, and again, is a way for us to live through fantasy. Her legs go on for what seems like forever, and she can effortlessly go from serving African neck coils (and nothing else) to an ultra-sexy look, to twinning with her boo, Nfon with her natural hair. Take a look at her Instagram, it is completely captivating. Rather than being cynical, shouldn’t we be celebrating the fact that a dark-skinned, black woman is gaining popularity in fashion – even if she isn’t real? That isn’t to discredit or erase existing or new black models and, in fact, could help promote conversations around diversity in fashion. It shouldn’t go unmentioned that all of the CGI models currently are the forefront are POCs, which is more that can be said for the majority of runway shows. If this is the new frontier of the modelling industry, these numbers are looking very favourable. Text Kemi Alemoru I’m someone that exists on the fringes of what is fashionable. For example, I don’t actually own any luxury items and spend Monday-to-Friday throwing together the first things I see strewn across my floordrobe. Nevertheless, even though I don’t feel a part of the industry I know what is trending and right now people of colour are having a “moment”. For years, all-white campaigns were something you’d never bat an eyelid to. Now, a make-up ad or streetwear campaign without any people of colour looks incredibly out of touch. You see this in how something as simple as swatching cosmetic collections is inherently political post-Fenty Beauty, with companies being dubbed “embarrassing” if their darker shade range is limited. Just this week a “colonialism” themed fashion line modelled by a white man sparked outrage for being so obviously tone-deaf. This is probably because young people have become increasingly empathetic towards race issues since social media has made debates more accessible. The absence of black, asian, hispanic faces in your brand only help to strengthen online discourse about exclusion and prejudice. In short, it’s just not good for your brand to exclude people of colour (POC) right now. This backdrop is impossible to ignore when considering the rise of CGI influencers of colour. Some commentators think the likes of Lil Miquela and Shudu are a clever comment on authenticity on social media or the fashion industry’s obsession with perfection. However, there’s a danger that this is just another vehicle for brands to cash in on what is popular without having to give props and jobs to POC. Take Lil Miquela. Her feed is very of-the-moment oscillating between streetwear looks and pivotal pop culture moments like celebrating Lena Waithe’s Vanity Fair cover after becoming the first black woman to win an Emmy for comedy writing. She’s vocal about social issues in Bushwick, Brooklyn – an area of New York where only 9 per cent of the population is white. Aided by her ethnic ambiguity, the Spanish-Brazilian Californian has enough cultural cache to talk about racial issues like Black Lives Matter while managing to look socially conscious, rather than aggressive or divisive. If Miquela was actually real, her radical passion and ethnicity might work against her. Luckily, she is a pixelated simulacrum – an embodiment of what is popular – without the burden of actually having to exist. So she’s picking up brand partnerships at quite a rate, while influencers of colour remain largely ignored by luxury brands. In February, Prada and Miquela teamed up for an Instagram takeover. Until recently, the brand’s record on diversity has been questionable – before Jourdan Dunn in 2008, the last black model to walk for the brand was Naomi Campbell in 1993. While Miquela was taking over on IG, Sudanese-American model Anok Yai became the first black model to open a Prada runway show in more than 20 years. So while it’s props to Prada for helping Yai make her way into the industry, couldn’t they have given their social media accounts to an IRL POC? “Brands can borrow Shudu’s deep melanated skin, Nfon’s wide sculpted features, and Miquela’s feisty online persona without the hassle of smashing the glass ceiling to let POC reach the top” – Kemi Alemoru This isn’t an isolated issue. In 2016, a Fashion Spot report found that almost 80 per cent of models in luxury brand ads were white. Yet, the “world’s first digital supermodel” Shudu, has 99.5k followers and a burgeoning career. She has already modelled Oscar de la Renta jewellery, Fenty lip shades, and has a host of viral shoots with her male counterpart Nfon. Shudu and Nfon are the brainchild of London-based photographer and digital artist Cameron-James Wilson who told Harper’s Bazaar that Shudu was his “art piece”. “She is not a real model unfortunately, but she represents a lot of the real models of today. There’s a big kind of movement with dark skin models, so she represents them and is inspired by them,"" he explained. “Obviously some models like Duckie (Thot) were definitely big inspirations for her as well.” Funnily enough, Thot has been vocal about how difficult it was to get her start in the industry because of her shade. What Wilson is inadvertently saying is that black people are trendy right now, not because the industry wants to improve its shocking record diversity, but purely because people love the black aesthetic. It’s objectification in its purest form. Now brands can borrow Shudu’s deep melanated skin, Nfon’s wide sculpted features, and Miquela’s feisty online persona without the hassle of smashing the glass ceiling to let POC reach the top. In the past, I’ve argued against the boring backlash of calling individuals out for appropriation when they borrow from black culture. Enjoying someone else’s culture is a natural way to appreciate differences and develop culture in music, fashion, and beauty – if you cite your influences then it’s all good. However, what I do take issue with is a whole industry that clearly favours black and minority ethnic aesthetics on anyone but minorities. To champion a coded character over POC influencers and models looking for jobs is nothing short of fetishisation. As Naomi Campbell told GQ recently: “We’re not a trend.” If you like what women of colour represent, and how they look, then hire them. They should be remunerated and championed. Until then, your CGI imitations only prove that you love the looks of POC, but not the reality of us.

"If the last few months in fashion have proven anything, it’s that more and more brands are moving away from traditional show formats. Some – like Proenza Schouler and Rodarte – decided to move from New York to Paris to present during the Couture shows, while Vetements shocked us all by dropping off the runway for good. Italian brand Aniye By is also doing things its own way, presenting its SS18 show off schedule this week in Milan. Creative director Alessandra Marchi’s aim for this season was to turn the nightclub into a runway, which made sense with the venue for the show. Held in Porta D’Oro – a historic gentleman’s club in the city centre – the low-lighting paired with the mirrored ceilings, crystal chandeliers and plush red carpet walls heightened the sensuality of the collection. As for the clothes themselves, they seemed to be inspired by America, or more specifically the American dream – a message that was emblazoned on tees, along with the word “California”. If that wasn’t clear enough, then the stars-and-stripes printed dress really hit the message home. Elsewhere, the collection explored rock ‘n’ roll via Woodstock. Strutting along to a soundtrack of Janis Joplin’s “Piece of My Heart” the models wore floral dresses with lace inserts, sparkly lurex jumpsuits and pointed metallic flats. The ribbons that replaced sleeves of dresses were tied up the arms of models and read “Aniye By Rock and Roll”. Even the more masculine pieces in the collection – like a beige trench coat – were feminised with lace trimming at the hem. Perhaps more than just tropes of America culture, this was Aniye By’s subtle way of hinting at where the brand might present its next collection... We’ll have to wait and see.

"The September shows are just around the corner, and so are the fashion week parties. One such party will be for the launch of Gloss: The Work of Chris von Wangenheim, a monograph on the fashion photographer. Von Wangenheim’s work encapsulated the glamour and excess of the 70s – and by the looks of dress code, the party will too. Marc Jacobs is hosting the event and, along with it, enforcing a ‘strict dress to kill code’. But it isn’t “formal” or “white tie” – the dress code includes sequins, gold lamé turbans and sheer harem pants. It pays homage to some icons of the decade: “Jerry Hall side-swept hair”, “Patty Heart Symbionese Liberation Army Gear” and “Grace Jones butch” and invites guests to ride in on a white horse – just as Bianca Jagger did for her birthday at Studio 54, back in 1977. The dress code doesn’t come as a surprise coming from Jacobs who has earned a reputation for outlandish party wear. A famous lover of skirts, the designer turned up to a Paris Fashion Week party in 2012 wearing a pink t-shirt dress, hand-in-hand with Peter Marino, who himself was dressed in his trademark bondage gear. Read the party’s full dress code, as included in the invitation sent to Yahoo Style, below: STRICT DRESS TO KILL CODE WILL BE ENFORCED: FUR COATS OVER LINGERIE, LIP GLOSS, JERRY HALL SIDE-SWEPT HAIR, SEQUINS, GOLD LAMÉ TURBANS, PATTY HEARST SYMBIONESE LIBERATION ARMY GEAR, ROGUE, ROLLERINA CHIC, SHEER HAREM PANTS, MINI SKIRTS AND MUSCULAR LEGS, PLATINUM RECORDS AS HEAD GEAR, SEQUINS, GRACE JONES BUTCH REALNESS, GLOSS-Y SKIN, BLEACHED EYEBROWS, SLITS, RIDING IN ON A WHITE HORSE, SEQUINS, SKY HIGH STILETTOS, MIRRORED AVIATORS, METAL MESH, COWL NECKLINE HALTERS, OR EYES OF LAURA MARS CHIC.

"Back in January, Demna Gvasalia took us for a night at the museum, as he presented his AW19 Vetements collection among the stuffed giraffes, lions, and monkeys at Paris's Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle, and paid tribute to the punks of 2019: the internet nerds. Despite that one feeling like it was approx. 4 seconds ago, tonight we got to see what the game-changing designer’s got in store for us come SS20. Strap in. ...in a black wrapper (there was pink too) featuring the label’s unmistakable logo. What’s that noise in the distance? Oh, probably just a small stampede as 489,847 fuckboys rush to log on to eBay in a bid to score themselves one (at a ridiculously jacked-up price) – nothing to worry about. ...where milkshakes and Cokes – but sadly no nuggets – were offered to guests as they arrived and took their places at the restaurant’s tables and in its booths. Fun fact (depending on your definition of fun): the McDonald’s referred to as the coolest in the world is actually situated in Batumi, Georgia, aka Demna’s home country. The second model out on the runway appeared wearing a Vetements-ified McDonald’s uniform with a name-badge that read ‘Capitalism!’ pinned to his chest. We know, we know: criticising the capitalist system is a bit rich coming from a brand that deems £500 an acceptable price for a hoodie. As is usually the case when it comes to Vetements collections, though, the look came with the hint of a raised eyebrow and what felt like a heavy dose of irony. Insert wink emoji. Where for a while Vetements and Balenciaga felt close to indistinguishable, over the course of the last couple of seasons the former has started to veer back into its own lane – with tonight’s show feeling particularly full of renewed energy. If Balenciaga has basically always been the cool, knowing older sibling, then Vetements is back to its best as the rebellious, cynical, slightly bratty kid brother or sister who’s angry at and tired of the world (as well as the fact their parents won’t lend them £500 for the aforementioned hoodie). As ever, Demna took tropes we’re all familiar with and twisted them on their head, as security and fast food employee uniforms were exaggerated and subverted, tailoring and sportswear styles reached their usual XXL proportions, and household brand names were once again given new context within the collection: with the likes of Bose, Vodafone, Heineken, PlayStation, and Internet Explorer (which became ‘Ecstasy’) among them. Elsewhere, models in padded overcoats with Norwegian death metal-inspired corpse-painted faces and others wearing panelled bike leathers, muscle vests, and boxy bombers stormed round the runway. Accessories included ear pods, a go-pro, and, in one case, a portion of fries. Just as we expected: if Demna has anything to do with it, they’re going to be everywhere very soon. Resistance is futile.

"Well, that was a fashion show for the history books. Two decades on from the moment on the Grammy’s red carpet where J.Lo showed up wearing that green Versace dress, the singer came out to give it another go in the spotlight at Versace’s SS20 showing in Milan. Before appearing on the runway to do a lap to an overwhelming amount of screaming and applause, the Hustlers actress was introduced by her hit song, “Love Don’t Cost a Thing”. The singer’s voice then asked Google (as part of what was maybe the best Google sponcon ever?) ‘show me images of the Versace jungle dress’ which were then projected onto screens decorating the runway. A clear nod to the dawn of Google Images, which was launched due to the amount of people searching for the dress on the site after its red carpet debut. She then closed the show wearing the infamous outfit, only slightly updated into a sleeveless look decorated with green paillettes. But before this there was a collection of clothes to take in, too. The show was kicked off with fitted black dresses paired with gladiator sandal adorned with signature Versace detailing, in the form of gold buttons and belts. With the likes of new gen supers including Kendall Jenner and Bella Hadid modelling, pieces were lined with the Versace print which J-Lo wore 20 years ago. This motif also featured across a range of dresses, coats, and skirts. With oversized shoulder pads, large glasses, and super short hemlines, this season Donatella Versace presented a killer collection. But we think we can all agree, even 20 years on, that green dress will always be the star of the show.

"Last week, Supreme made headlines after founder James Jebbia was nominated for Menswear Designer of the Year at the upcoming 2018 CFDA Awards. Following the news, we explored if this signalled the end of its anti-establishment roots. The latest rumour suggests so, with the brand apparently collaborating with Dolce & Gabbana on a new collection. After Supreme’s collaboration with Louis Vuitton – definitively the collaboration of the year – fans and hypebeasts alike have been wondering if there will be another designer collaboration on the way. One person who is turning the rumour mill is half of the design duo, Stefano Gabbana. Often active on Instagram (remember his feuds with Miley Cyrus and Diet Prada?) Gabbana regrammed from some of Supreme’s most reliable info accounts – among them @supreme_leaks_news that has over 1 million followers – leading to speculation that the rumours are in fact true. The designer hasn’t confirmed or denied whether or not the collaboration will actually take place, leaving it up to the fans to hype it up. According to @boxlogosupreme though, the collection was signed off last week and will be released during the AW18 season, priced at the usual high-end level. Officially, there is no word from Supreme as to whether or not the collaboration is going to drop, but keep an eye out for more – stranger things have happened in fashion.

"No one knows what our future holds, but luckily we can rely on creativity to challenge and deliberate how the world will work in years to come. This is the sentiment of Mercedes-Benz's latest project, the #WeWonder Manifesto, that unites seven of the world’s leading visionaries to dream about the potential of our world’s future. The manifesto is a written vision of the future that was produced from a roundtable featuring Solange, Slick Woods, art director Hans Ulrich Obrist, KENZO creative directors Carol Lim and Humberto Leon, Hypebeast founder Kevin Ma, and writer Kimberly Drew, who all united to deliberate on the topic. Together, the seven creatives dreamed about the future as neither a utopia or dystopia, but rather a reality of what is humanly possible to achieve if we make art driven by hope and inspiration. Each creative brings a different theme to the discussion and all ideas in the manifesto will be released through a series of global events, appearances, and digital activations across 2018. Drawing on her success as one of the world’s leading musicians, Solange brings a courageous independence to the manifesto and for the project's events, she will be fearless when exploring the most provocative issues we face in our future. Slick Woods represents a new generation of boundary-breaking free-thinkers, while leading curator, Hans Ulrich Obrist, brings an unfaltering curiosity and a passion for conversation to the topic: “If we want to address the big questions of the future and of the 21st century, we need to think beyond the fear of pooling knowledge and bring all the disciplines together”, Obrist states in the press release. This is why the project is so interesting.” Kimberly Drew will be the first to unveil her theme and will be chairing a panel discussion at SXSW in March 2018. You can find out more info here

"It goes without saying that the fashion industry could stand to do better when it comes to diversity, but where things seem to be slowly improving when it comes to race and gender representation, women that don’t fit neatly into a tiny, sample size garment are still woefully underrepresented within the industry (and beyond). Thankfully, there are some brands trying to change that. The likes of Eckhaus Latta, Savage x Fenty, Telfar, and Gypsy Sport regularly include plus-size models on their line-ups, while Raisa Flowers, Emma Breschi, Barbie Knox, and Jill Kortleve are bringing wider visibility for different bodies both on the runway and off. Joining those ranks is Nike, which yesterday unveiled its new dedicated women’s space its London flagship store, NikeTown, and with it a series of plus-size mannequins. The move is a significant one, particularly in the hands of a sportswear behemoth such a Nike – helping to shift the existing narrative that being plus-sized is aligned with being inactive and unhealthy. The space will also offer personal styling and shopping opportunities, an enormous footwear selection, and appointments with personal trainers and sports coaches. “The re-designed space is just another demonstration of Nike’s commitment to inspiring and serving the female athlete,” explains Nike Europe vice president Sarah Hannah. “This is more than a shopping experience, it’s a destination to celebrate sport just in time for an incredible summer of football, netball, athletics, and more.”

"Since its launch nearly two years ago, fashion label GmbH has been quietly perfecting its aesthetic, often taking inspiration from the clubwear of Berlin where it is based. For the brand’s most recent SS18 collection, founders Benjamin Alexander Huseby and Serhat Isik wanted to create a utopian vision without borders or limits – calling it ‘Europe Endless’. As descendants of immigrants themselves, they paid homage to their fathers who came to Europe from Turkey and Pakistan. The newly-released campaign continues the idea, with Huseby and Isik wanting to showcase the children of those who moved from elsewhere to help rebuild Germany after the war. “We thought of the expression ‘Gastarbeiter’ commonly used in Germany, meaning guest worker. As visitors, they were expected by their host countries to only stay temporarily, but they never left,” the pair told us. “We, the children, are at once European, but also told we do not truly belong.” This idea of belonging is something that will be understood by anyone who has grown up separated from their roots. “In Denmark, the parliament recently declared that children of immigrants are not to be considered Danish,” the pair explained. “(This) sentiment (is) not unfamiliar to us. ‘Where are you from? No, but where are you really from?’” The campaign itself pays homage to classic Versace campaigns shot by Richard Avedon in the 80s and 90s. “We wanted to see brown men and women like ourselves in a campaign like this, something we never saw growing up. But we have no supermodels, or big budget – just our family.” Like the designers, all of the models featured are children of immigrants themselves, with parents from places including Sri Lanka, Azerbaijan and India. Fans of the label won’t have long to wait for its next instalment, with its AW18 show set to take place on January 16 during PFW. @gmbh_official

"The slogan t-shirt’s origins lie in the 1960s, when Mr. Freedom – the iconic pop art-inspired fashion boutique on the King’s Road – started printing and selling Disney slogan-inspired t-shirts. Next came Westwood, who added her radical political slant, and last but by no means least, arrived the genius of Katharine Hamnett, the woman who asked us to ‘CHOOSE LIFE’, and shook Thatcher’s hand in a top that read ‘58% DON’T WANT PERSHING’. It’s what happens when those statements are translated for a Chinese audience that the founders of IG account @shanzhai_lyric are obsessed with – when the meaning or sentiment is lost or confused somewhere along the way, and the resulting slogans become obscure, nonsensical, or completely bizarre. First and foremost, the account is humorous: scroll through their grid and you’ll find pictures of printed t-shirts which almost make sense, bar a minor spelling error – ‘Please always know that I love you more than anything else in the world’– as well as the truly baffling – ‘this image is a vector design can let you from in or out get.’ “Founders Ming Lin and Alexandra Tatarsky want to build an archive of “experimental poetry” – what they call “the Shanzhai Lyric” From their findings, Ming Lin and Alexandra Tatarsky, who run the account out of Kowloon, Hong Kong, want to build an archive of “experimental poetry” – what they call “the Shanzhai Lyric.” “The word shanzhai is most frequently translated as counterfeit, but literally means mountain hamlet, home to bandits, outlaws, the poor – all those who live their lives on the outskirts of society,” the pair explain. “Often there is delightful humour in the unexpected collisions of meaning, but what really resonates with us about these t-shirts is how deeply we can be moved by apparent nonsense, how it actually seems to describe with poetic precision the experience of living in an utterly nonsensical world. The linguistic mash-ups of different realms and registers capture what it's like to live in a time of information overload, constantly inundated by so many empty signifiers where shininess takes precedence over substance.” Well, quite. The archive they are building is all about rejoicing in the utter absurdity of, essentially, the human condition – not poking fun at the wearers of these shanzhai pieces or those that create them, but showcasing that these garments point to just how baffling the world actually is, seeing through the endless crap of the now meaningless slogan t-shirt, and explaining that, in true meaninglessness, there is a reflection of us as consumers, as people. What’s the difference between one of those Gio-Goi tees from the naughties which read ‘Ketamine: Just Say Neigh’ and a sparkly shanzhai top which reads ‘sunkist GoodVibration!’? Very little. They both mean nothing. “Our images are mostly sourced from streetscapes and clothing markets in Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Dongguan and Beijing,” Ming and Alexandra add. “Further afield are entries from New York, Moscow, Ho Chi Minh City, and beyond. In fact, one can find shanzhai lyrics almost anywhere! One distinction we find important to make is that we are not interested in t-shirt texts that incite pleasure by poking fun at the wearer. Rather, our fascination lies in reading these t-shirts as a unique body of experimental poetry.” “What’s the difference between one of those Gio-Goi tees from the 00s which read ‘Ketamine: Just Say Neigh’ and a sparkly shanzhai top which reads ‘sunkist GoodVibration!’? Very little. They both mean nothing” Their growing archive has culminated in a gallery residency at Clearview over the month of August. “Our residency coincides with a new cycle of work seeking to place the phenomenon of the shanzhai lyric within a lineage of textual experimentation and word play in artistic practice. We are looking at works that employ mimicry, hybridity, and irreverence as tactics to undermine or question notions of authorship, authenticity, and originality.” It’s taking fail culture and flipping it on its head: finding joy and meaning in the truly nonsensical. After all, is that not what all this is about? @shanzhai_lyric

"Last season at London Fashion Week, things took a turn for the surreal when Her Majesty the Queen rolled up to 180 The Strand and proceeded to make her way into Richard Quinn’s AW18 show, where she sat FROW (obvs) next to Anna Wintour. Today at his LFW presentation, though, she was nowhere to be seen – instead, pupils from the designer’s former schools took the best seats in the house. According to the show’s press notes, there has been a 34% drop in arts GCSE entries between 2010 and 2018, with arts-focused subjects severely under threat thanks to government cuts (s/o to Theresa May and her Tory cronies, you’re doing amazing sweeties!), and the students’ inclusion in the event was to highlight that. “At a time when real damage is occurring to arts education in the UK, I want to point to how substantially its creative power lights the path to our future,” said Quinn. “It’s important to me to celebrate the community I come from, and thank the British education system for the fact I am in business today.” Guests included students from Chislehurst and Sidcup Grammar School, St Thomas More Catholic Comprehensive, and Central Saint Martins. The collection itself started off with Quinn’s now-signature morphsuit looks, which models wore under huge, dramatic ruffled dresses and structured trapeze coats in floral prints. As they made their way around the catwalk, the London Philharmonic Orchestra played Lana Del Rey’s “Young and Beautiful” and lightning flashed up on the walls. So far, so dramatic. But what did the students make of what was, for many, their first ever fashion show? “It made me think maybe I want a job in fashion one day. Or I might still be a teacher, I don’t know” – Amy, St Thomas More Comprehensive “It was amazing! I’m speechless, it was so good. I liked all the looks,” said Amy from St Thomas More Comprehensive. “It made me think maybe I want a job in fashion one day. Or I might still be a teacher, I don’t know.” Students Sophia and Ellen loved the morphsuits “because they looked like mannequins, they were really cool,” while another, Tom, explained that, although he liked the show, hyped streetwear designers were more his thing: “I thought it was so cool, but actually I really like Supreme and stuff like that.” Tom went on to explain he wasn’t thinking about going into fashion when he finishes school, “but I think I would quite like to be a graphic designer.” Charlotte Collins, though, was particularly enthusiastic: “I loved the shapes and the colours,” she explained. “It was quite a big deal because he went to our school when he was younger. I want to work in fashion too – I’d love to be the editor of a magazine, so it was quite inspiring.” A new Jefferson Hack in the making? Watch this space.

"From the moment the first whispers of a collaboration between adidas and Prada started circulating a few months ago, fashion fans sat on tenterhooks waiting for it to be confimed. In early November, both labels finally posted an official announcement to their Instagram accounts, but at that point the only thing on show was a classic Prada carrier bag with two adidas shoeboxes peeking out of it. This morning, we finally got a look at what the collab actually entails, with both of the fashion giants debuting two of the products to their millions of followers via Instagram. In a post which comprised a still image and a short video, the collection sees a pair of classic adidas Superstars embossed with the Prada logo, as well as a dual-branded, 70s-style bowling bag rendered in sleek white leather. Both items reflect a fusion of the key characteristics of the two iconic brands, and show that sportswear’s foray into the world of luxury fashion is going absolutely nowhere for the 2020s. The drop is planned for December 4 2019 when the pieces will be available to buy online on the adidas and Prada websites, as well as in selected Prada stores – but given only 700 of each style has been made, good luck getting your hands on them.

"With September fast approaching, it can only mean one thing – fashion month is almost upon us. Starting in New York, you’ve got the likes of Vaquera, Marc Jacobs, Raf Simons’ Calvin Klein, and returning labels Proenza Schouler and Rodarte all to look forward to. Also joining the line-up is Rihanna, with her Savage x Fenty label making its runway debut. Launching earlier this year, the lingerie line demonstrates the singer’s main goal of being diverse – featuring 90s styles in 36 sizes. At the moment, little is known of what the NYFW presentation – taking place on September 12 – will bring, but it’s promised it will be an “immersive experience”. And who wouldn’t want to be immersed in the world of Fenty? Obviously, this isn’t her first NYFW show. She used to present her Fenty Puma label there too before moving over to Paris; the brand is currently on a break at the moment. Keep an eye out to see what Rih has in store for us in just a few weeks time.

"If you’re after the best cocktails around, forget New York and Paris – London is where it’s at. From absinthe bitters infused with truffle sugars and squid ink to the more classic strawberry mojito, the art of the cocktail is akin to the art of a stylish outfit. Which is probably why Karen Langley, former Dazed fashion director, is one of the experts behind Ryan Chetiyawardana's Mr. Lyan, a creative hospitality team and brand that has created five of the world’s first bespoke, bottled cocktails to drink at home. These stylishly handcrafted cocktails are launching exclusively with Selfridges this week as part of their ‘Meet the Makers’ series, and we’re very excited to get tipsy (or blind drunk, if you're that way inclined) on them. So what’s exactly in these cocktails and why are they so special? Mr. Lyan is renowned for combining unusual and rare ingredients so they’re certainly not like anything else on the market right now. From a gin martini with vermouth and a citrus and green olive distillate to a sweet bourbon lined with candlewax, these bottled cocktails are best served chilled in Summer, which is why they’re only available for the two best months of the year – July and August. Although if you're in desperate need of a cocktail of the unique variety any other time of year, then they've got a cocktail bar in Hoxton – White Lyan – another one of the rich new projects in mixology of which Karen Langley is amongst its creators. White Lyan is at 153-155 Hoxton St, London N1 6PJ

"Despite being around for over 117 years, Chanel has never officially launched a menswear line – although there have been men’s looks on the runway (hello, Chanel-wearing sailors at its recent cruise-y Cruise show). Not letting that stop it from reaching the male market, the Parisian label has today announced that it will be launching a make-up line just for men. “Just as Gabrielle Chanel borrowed elements from the men’s wardrobe to dress women, Chanel draws inspiration from the women’s world to write the vocabulary of a new personal aesthetic for men,” a statement about the collection read. Named Boy de Chanel – as a nod to founder Gabrielle Chanel’s muse and lover, Boy Capel – the small three-piece line will include a tinted fluid, eyebrow pencil, and moisturising lip balm. The collection will first launch in South Korea on September 1, with the rest of the world able to get their hands on it from November – yay for inclusivity.

"In contemporary pop culture, few can rival Lady Gaga’s pioneering attitude towards fashion. And ‘pioneering’ is one word that could be used to describe her outfit for the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards. The singer wore a dress made from raw flank steak, along with shoes, a purse and a hat – made from the same material. Five years on, the dress has been put on display at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in Cleveland, Ohio. Designed by artist and fashion designer Franc Fernandez, the dress was styled by Dazed’s former creative director Nicola Formichetti. Following the award show, the garment was placed in a meat locker, then a vat of chemicals and, to counteract some discolouration that had occured, was painted to look fresh. Now the dress, along its accessories, is being exhibited as part of the museum’s Women Who Rock exhibition. However these pieces are only on loan to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, they still remain in the possession of Lady Gaga. And she’s pretty happy about that fact that they are being exhibited at the museum. “That meat dress represents part of, a very small, small part of the movement towards equality, and for it to be honored in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is the shit,” she told accesshollywood.com. As for how long the dress is expected to last, museum’s the director of collections Jun Francisco told mtv.com, “We don’t know. Nobody has tried anything like this before and so a lot of conservators have never experienced this. There was another meat dress in the past, but they actually let it rot. It wasn’t preserved at all. But this one is different since it’s now beef jerky—we’re assuming the lifespan of this dress is the lifespan of beef jerky!” Watch the video below to see what Lady Gaga’s meat dress looks like now:

"It was mere weeks ago since we sat down to watch Maria Grazia Chiuri’s SS18 Surrealist-inspired Dior couture show, but here we are again. For AW18, Chiuri once again looked to a formidable woman for inspiration, this time in the form of Diana Vreeland, as well as the protests of a particular group of young feminists in 1960s Paris. Here’s everything you need to know. Face of Dior skincare Cara Delevingne sat shoulder to shoulder with Bianca Jagger and Guram Gvasalia on the front row. Also spotted was Selah Marley with possibly the best hair we’ve ever seen, as well as artist, fashion designer and filmmaker Maripol, who’s worked with the likes of Grace Jones, Debbie Harry, and Madonna over the course of her decades-long career. From old torn up issues of Vogue from the 60s to placards bearing phrases like: “Women’s rights are human rights” and “I am a woman”. Chiuri’s ongoing support and celebration of liberated and forward-thinking women shows no sign of abating, although this collection was without a slogan tee or some feminist reading material provided on the seats. Particularly ‘68, which was a big year in Paris thanks to the student protests, as well as in fashion and pop culture history. The late 60s saw a generation of youth rise up to challenge both the morals of their parents’ generation and of their governments, leading Vreeland to coin the term ‘youthquake’. Chiuri was also inspired by a 1966 protest staged by a group of young women outside the Dior store, all bearing signs which read ‘Mini Skirts Forever’. Marc Bohan, then-creative director, was inspired to launch Miss Dior, as he reinterpreted the feminine codes set out by Christian Dior himself. Colourful patchwork jackets, fringing, dyed crochet, clashing panelled denim and even a few very space-age silver pieces made up the collection (this was the time when the space race was raging, after all). These were definitely flower children – Teddy Quinlivan hit the catwalk in a diaphanous frilled floral dress, while Adwoa Aboah closed the show in a sheer dress covered in embroidered flowers.They still had an edge though – Adwoa’s peace sign jumper and many of the other looks from the show were paired with heavy biker boots. Accessories came in the form of the house’s iconic saddle bag, baker-boy style hats and brightly coloured sunglasses of huge proportions, that sat in stark contrast to the wave of small frames that have infiltrated the catwalk lately.

"Ever fantasised about wearing an incredible Comme des Garçons showpiece or a pristine silk Prada coat (let’s face it: who hasn’t) but couldn’t quite commit to dropping a large amount of cash on them? Well, there’s good news. You can now borrow them from fashion rental company Higher Studio. The brainchild of designer Sara Arnold, Higher Studio was founded in a bid to put the idle clothes in her wardrobe to good use, while also addressing the issue of sustainability in fashion. The curated edit features new and archival garments from the likes of Junya Watanabe, Maison Martin Margiela and Issey Miyake, and sits in stark contrast to other clothing rental sites. “I know there are a lot of rental companies out there, but, in my mind, there are none that approach design with such a level of authenticity and integrity in their brand choices – and that’s what I wanted to offer,” explains Sara, who studied fashion design at Central Saint Martins. “While I was studying, I thought I wanted my own label. But I was always interested in sustainability and people just weren't talking about it as much in 2012 as they are now,” she continues, “I wanted to know how I could actually have a brand that’s selling stuff, and not compromising on either creativity or the values that were important to me. There didn’t seem to be a way around that.” Instead of setting up her own label when she graduated from CSM, Arnold enrolled in a business course at Imperial College London, with the intention of getting to grips with running a business: Higher Studio was the result of that. “So many people I know in the industry have these amazing items of clothing sitting in their wardrobes unused and it’s such a shame, they should be worn,” she tells us. “I want to close the loop on clothing production, and renting is so much more sustainable that manufacturing new pieces.” Higher Studio’s offering will be updated on a regular basis, but the line-up currently includes unforgettable (and hard-to-get-your-hands-on) showpieces like the Comme des Garçons hot-pink cloud top from AW12, and a reconstructed trench coat from Maison Margiela’s SS10 collection – many featured here in a new editorial shot by Dougal MacArthur and styled by Adonis Kentros. Prices start from just £25 per week. “A lot of the items are either super rare or too expensive for many to be able to justify buying, so it’s great to see them getting worn by people that really appreciate them, that’s what I want!” Arnold says. “A lot of the items are either super rare or too expensive for many to be able to justify buying, so it’s great to see them getting worn by people that really appreciate them, that’s what I want!” – Sara Arnold Though eventually the plan is to add a line of basic pieces to the edit, for now it’s mainly memorable items from standout collections, “I worked in Dover Street Market for five years when I was studying, and I’m obsessed with Comme. I see our customers as people in the creative industries, maybe a bit of a classic Marni girl, you know? But then when she’s exposed to rental pieces, she’s willing to be much more experimental. Because she doesn’t have to commit to spending huge amounts, it makes the clothes seem so much more approachable and fun.” Aesthetics aside, Arnold is convinced clothing rental is another step closer to the fashion industry becoming more sustainable: one of her main goals when she first thought up the concept of Higher Studio. “We are facing so many issues in fashions, and I want to address as many as I can, even down to cleaning the rental clothes using special machines that don’t let microplastics get into the water supply,” she says. “I see Higher Studio as the solution to a lot of problems - I really hope it will be.” With a small edit of amazing pieces and more landing in April, Higher Studio could certainly be the solution to many issues surrounding sustainability: not just when it comes to the planet, but also when it comes to sustaining your bank balance.

"After months of anticipation, yesterday Virgil Abloh finally presented his debut Louis Vuitton menswear collection. With the likes of Kanye West, Kim K, Kylie Jenner, Takashi Murakami, Naomi Campbell, Rihanna, the fashion press, and about a thousand students all attending, it’s safe to say all eyes were on the designer. If there was another person in line for most watched though, it would be Lash, who opened the show. Coming down the rainbow runway in a tailored look from the all-white-everything section of the show, the huge moment marked his first stint on the catwalk. “I wouldn’t say I’m a model, though” he explains backstage. “I’m modelling.” “Louis Vuitton has always been the one that I’ve looked at, but it’s been so far away. Virgil coming into it changes it completely” – Lash Hailing from London and part of Skepta’s crew, Lash counts Grace Ladoja and Naomi Campbell (“she’s the queen of the industry,” he says) among his fans. Obviously Abloh is too, given he drafted him to open the show just a day before it took place. “I walked into the fitting with and he said ‘oh yeah, your photo is first’”, he explains. For some, something this big might trigger an attack of nerves. But not Lash: he was “ready to execute”. The respect Abloh has for Lash is clearly mutual, with the LV opener noting the importance of his appointment as the first black designer at the Parisian house. “Louis Vuitton has always been the one that I’ve looked at, but it’s been so far away. Virgil coming into it changes it completely,” he says. “I’m just part of a movement right now – I don’t know what movement it is but it’s history and we’re part of it.”

"Led by a new generation of creative youth, there’s a cultural revolution happening on the streets of Tbilisi right now. Across fashion, art, music, and beyond, today we explore what’s happening in the Georgian capital, and why the city deserves to be on your radar. In Tbilisi, fashion is flourishing. The Georgian city’s Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week draws more crowds every season. A succession of concept stores stocking everything from emerging local designers to established fashion brands are dotted around its streets. And, over the course of the last few years, labels including Situationist and George Keburia have asserted themselves as ones to watch – not only in their native country, but internationally too (Bella and Rihanna have both declared themselves fans). Unlike many of the established fashion capitals, though, the conversation surrounding gender hasn’t really taken off in the city just yet, with only a couple of designers offering collections that moved beyond the binary. One of them is Aka Prodiashvili, whose SS19 offering was among the standouts at MBFW Tbilisi in November. On the last day of the event, Prodiashvili’s show took place in a stark concrete space, where, at the centre, a long dinner table piled high with fruit and wilting flowers and foliage was lit by long tapered candles in antique candlesticks. As the lights dimmed, models emerged onto the runway in a series of looks that drew inspiration not only from the 1980s, but drag icons past and present. “Sasha Velour will forever be inspiring to me,” explains Prodiashvili, “And I always have Violet (Chachki) in mind when I’m designing.” The designer’s cast of androgynous models – many of them part of progressive Georgian agency Troublemakerz – slowly walked down the runway in leather trench coats trimmed with garish, tiger print fur, strapless cocktail dresses embellished with ostrich feathers, sequin-strewn catsuits, and silky smoking-style jackets, their faces painted with make-up that sat somewhere between high-concept drag and Dior circa 97. It wasn’t just looks the models were serving, though: some carried silver platters of food, as the designer conjured up a full-on fashion dinner party fantasy. “I wanted the collection to celebrate Tbilisi’s new generation, and particularly its young, queer community,” says Prodiashvili. “The free thinkers, the people who aren’t afraid to break down walls and push the boundaries in everything they do, they’re the ones who are standing around the table.” It was a bold step for a young designer living in Tbilisi, where being LGBTQ+ isn’t without its problems, and homophobia is felt on its streets often. But, alongside designers like Irakli Rusadze of Situationist – who included a number of non-binary models and a trans woman he met on the dancefloor of Bassiani a few days before in his show – Prodiashvili is intent on pushing things forward with his vibrant, imaginative collections. He’s clearly doing something right – having spotted his work on Instagram, Arca slid into the designer’s DMs last summer and the two have been collaborating ever since. Most recently, the progressive musician was pictured wearing one of his high-shine vinyl bodysuits and a pair of fetishistic, tricep-length gloves, which was “a dream come true”. Following his SS19 show, we caught up with Prodiashvili about how he got started in fashion, how clothing can be a form of protest, and who’s next on his list of dream collaborators. How did you get into fashion? Aka Prodiashvili: When I was very young I started working on fashion shoots with some of the best Georgian photographers. I assisted on shoots for the likes of Vogue Ukraine, before eventually I started styling editorials myself. Before that, though, I was studying history of art. Why did you decide to make the leap from art to fashion? Aka Prodiashvili: Fashion was something that consisted of everything I wanted to do. I was working on music, I was drawing, I was painting… Fashion offered me the chance to do all of these things together. But I think I’d always been keen to work in fashion – I was interested in everything about clothing from a very young age. What are you inspired by? Aka Prodiashvili: I’m surrounded by the people that inspire me every day: the young artists, performers, and musicians that make up the new generation of Georgia. And of course, I’m always inspired by Björk, and Arca, who I’ve collaborated with. Sharing is so important in the arts, I think. You share something and someone shares something back with you and you both get inspired. You learn something from each other. That’s why, for me, inspiration will always come from different people. “Sharing is so important in the arts, I think. You share something and someone shares something back with you and you both get inspired. You learn something from each other” – Aka Prodiashvili You’re one of the few designers presenting gender-fluid collections in Tbilisi. Why is subverting gender important to you, and have you run into any obstacles designing in that way? Aka Prodiashvili: The new generation growing up in Georgia are very open to these ideas, but still, it’s something that’s very new here, and of course people don’t understand it. The obstacles I’ve faced have been many, but I use the energy from those instances to keep going, and turn this bad vibe into something good. Homophobia is a big thing many people in Georgia face, but because I’m surrounded by these free-thinkers who are very open-minded, I feel like I’m kind of in this bubble, which makes me feel protected as I go about trying to change things. And do you feel things are changing? Aka Prodiashvili: To a certain extent, yes. It’s still a problem in Georgia, but not as much as it used to be. We are working very hard to protest these outdated views, and the more we do, the more the older generation realise it’s actually not as bad as they thought. We actually had a woman, a lesbian woman, running for mayor, which would never have happened ten years ago. We’re an ex-Soviet country, so it was always going to take us a long time to change things. But in comparison to other Soviet countries, I think Georgia is doing very, very well. What was the inspiration behind the collection itself? Aka Prodiashvili: I actually did everything very fast, I only started on it three months ago. But this is something I always had in mind, so from the start I kind of knew how I wanted things to be. The main inspiration was the lifestyle of a drag queen, infused with a Baroque sensibility. Is there anyone else you’d love to collaborate with? Aka Prodiashvili: Sasha, Violet, Anohni. What’s your favourite piece from the SS19 collection? Aka Prodiashvili: The grey dress with the butterflies. The represent freedom to me, and, because they don’t live very long, it reminds me that things happen very fast in our lives, and that we should make the most of the time we have. What will your next collection be about? Aka Prodiashvili: I don’t know yet. I suppose it will be a reaction to whatever the next problem is in Georgia, as a way to keep trying to make things better. What are the biggest problems you want to tackle through your work? Aka Prodiashvili: What happened at Bassiani last year still weighs heavy on peoples’ minds here. The people the police and the government targeted – the photographers, the designers, the artists – are the people that are trying to make this country better. It was a really sad moment, but it was also a provocation, for us to keep fighting. So, whatever comes our way, this generation is ready to fight for what they believe in. And I’m going to keep fighting with my collections. @aka.prodiashvili

"It’s the end of the school year and graduate shows are underway all around the world. From Antwerp’s Royal Academy of Fine Art to London’s Central Saint Martins, students are adding the finishing touches to their final collections and sending them out onto the runway in front of audiences including family, tutors and influential people from the industry. This week was the turn of students from London College of Fashion, as the class of 2018's BA presented their work at East London's Oval Space. The show marked a turn towards innovation for the fashion school. “We are always looking for new ways to invest in our digital future and allow our students to express themselves in new and extraordinary ways,” says the school's head, Frances Corner. “This year’s LCF BA18 season (brought) digital to the fore, presenting a multisensory immersive experience with large scale screens and interactive media allowing viewers to experience LCF talent in bold, inspiring and memorable ways.” The show felt like an immersive experience that was part sci-fi exhibition and part fashion runway, which rallied together graduates from both media and design fields. Held in the bare concrete space, a simple halo of lights hanging from the ceiling highlighted the collections made by this year’s cohort of fashion BA students, bringing the eye directly to each unqiuely creative detail. Some of the highlights included ripped garments criss-crossed by a multitude of fluoro threads by menswear designer Alexandra Vincent, which echoed the designs created by Miette Farrer, whose distorted tops made of tangles of threads and wires. Matilda Aberg created metal headpieces twisted in front of the models’ veiled faces, while Amari Carter’s corsets, crafted from bra straps, were given a retro-futuristic look via tiny oval sunglasses. Colour and volume also formed a large part of the show, as seen in Jordan Charles’ multi-coloured panelled collection, and Amelia Skarpellis and and Alexandra Anderson's knitted, hooded garments. Xu balanced deconstructed tailoring with softer elements in the form of flowers, which were stitched across wide-legged trousers and hung from sunglasses. Elsewhere, Haoxin Chen and Kim Hyon Hye also worked with volumes, albeit in a more subtle way with light, sheer fabrics and plisse effects seen across pastel dresses and gingham-patterned aprons. Taking place back at Oval Space the following night, a number of students came together to present group projects worked on in partnership with Microsoft. Showcased as part of the Future of Fashion Incubator, groups were given access to mixed reality and Artificial Intelligence technologies to create programs that could revolutionise the industry. With a unique system designed to digitally store the details of garments (from how they were made and who by, through to the elements they are subjected to throughout their lifetime) and a functional app intended to create a more sustainable wardrobe among the ideas, LCF further demonstrated their commitment to pushing fashion forward through innovation. Who knows what next year will bring?

"For Dior’s AW15 campaign, the house has returned to its founder’s roots. “My childhood home sat on a cliff and lay exposed to the most turbulent of weather,” wrote Christian Dior in his autobiography. In these images, shot by Raf Simons’ long-time collaborator Willy Vanderperre, the flame-haired Dazed cover star Natalie Westling sits, like Dior’s childhood home, on a cliff with Dior runway veterans Julia Nobis and Mica Arganaraz. The modelling trio are clad in the house’s AW15 collection – the spirit of which Simons described as “something more liberated, darker, more sexual.” The vinyl thigh-highs (seen in this campaign) certainly indicated a move towards the more sexual.

"During all the chaos of NYFW, designer Yang Li is joining forces with Opening Ceremony to host a silent auction in support of Genesis P-Orridge. Last year, Li’s friend and artist Genesis P-Orridge was supposed to start a tour with their pioneering acid house band Psychic TV. Sadly, they were diagnosed with leukaemia and had to announce their retirement. In tribute, Li dedicated this season’s Samizdat offerings – his label of imaginary band merch – to the Psychic TV’s tour that Genesis P-Orridge had to cancel. Both Yang Li and Genesis P-Orridge’s personal collections, limited edition and rare records, prints and the Samizdat/Psychic TV merch will be auctioned through the silent fundraiser, the proceeds of which will go towards Genesis’ ongoing medical treatment. All the items are currently on display at the Ace Hotel’s gallery space – open to the public until September 13. See below details of the auction, that will be held at Ace Hotel New York on Friday September 7 from 6-8pm.

"Kim Kardashian-West is one of the most seen women in the world. Of course, being seen (and being recognised) forms the crux of contemporary celebrity culture. In paparazzi shots of banal daily activities, we hungrily consume images of famous people – by being in the crosshairs of the telephoto lens, their existence is marked out as something aspirational; they embody cultural myths, dreams which can be realised. If not by being the star of that reality TV show, or on that magazine cover, then perhaps by buying those shoes. Images of someone like Kardashian-West simply existing in the world – walking the street, heading out to pick up ice cream – are commodities in themselves, sold and traded and posted and liked. Beyond deciding on her outfit or her hair or make-up looks, she has little control over her own image if captured in public. And that’s what makes Kanye West’s Yeezy Season 6 lookbook – comprised solely of paparazzi-style images of Kim out and about in LA, and the first time the world is seeing the collection – so entirely brilliant. Posted out on Kardashian-West’s social media over a series of days, the images speak in a visual language we all understand, trading in the voyeuristic aesthetics of pap shots. Many seem convinced that the images were unknowingly shot by real paparazzi, but they’re just too perfect – the clothes have been styled by Carine Roitfeld, and each look offers a staged photo-op of the kind gossip sites are fueled by. ‘FedEx Run #Yeezy’, ‘Smoothie Run #Yeezy’, ‘McDonald’s Run #Yeezy’. The same mundane locations that become Mail Online fodder – the parking lot, the convenience store – are repurposed with self-aware intent, playing on the fact that Kardashian-West getting out of a car or shopping for Kit-Kats might become an incredibly influential fashion moment with a ripple effect across style culture (boosted by sharing the images to her millions of followers). But instead of being at the mercy of the paps, the Yeezy shots make her and West the active players. They are in control of this narrative. That can’t be said for many of West’s previous interactions with photographers – the musician and designer has had a famously terse relationship with paparazzi dating back years. “Till I get flashed by the paparazzi/ Damn, these niggas got me/ I hate these niggas more than the Nazi” he rapped in “Flashing Lights”, taken from 2007’s Graduation. The following year, he smashed a photographer’s camera and was ordered to complete 50 hours of community service. In 2013, an incident where a paparazzi accused him of trying to grab his camera led West (who had, pretty accurately, just said: “What you're trying to do is get me in trouble, so I step out and have to pay you like $250,000”) to be put on two years probation and given more community service work. “The same mundane locations that become Mail Online fodder are repurposed with brilliantly self-aware intent, playing on the fact that Kardashian-West shopping for Kit-Kats might become an influential fashion moment” A video shortly after that incident shows him having a measured, respectful conversation with a group of photographers, which is perhaps a more accurate summary of his relationship to the paps. “We’re in this together. You guys help me influence, you help with the family, you help Kim’s power and everything… I would prefer that we just have a decent relationship.” He also talks about (at the time just-born) daughter North West, who the paparazzi are obviously keen to get their first glimpse of. Now four, she has been filmed telling paps both “no pictures” and “no questions” on more than one occasion, dating from when she was two-and-a-half. Paparazzi, and the very real, invasive presence they maintain, are constants in the life of the West family. Fashion is always at its best when it holds a mirror to society – although West has sworn his past Yeezy collections were not acts of political or social commentary, his latest project examines the relationship between celebrity and style culture, exercising him and his wife’s power over their own image. In 2017, it felt like we didn’t stop talking about how designers copy each other (cc @dietprada). Kanye West may have been keeping a low profile lately – this collection was not shown during NYFW as previous seasons have been – but he’s closed out the year with one of fashion’s most original ideas in a while. Power to him.

"Whether it is Gucci’s recent Bloom campaign or Dries Van Noten’s breathtaking forest floor SS15 set, fashion is always looking to nature for inspiration – but does the industry care about the planet beyond pretty florals? That is a question the V&A’s next fashion exhibition – Fashioned from Nature – is asking. Tracing the complex relationship between fashion and the natural world from 1600 to now, the exhibition showcases examples that combine both beautiful design and ethical practices (it isn’t just hessian sack dresses as some might think). Featuring designs like Emma Watson’s 2016 Met Ball Calvin Klein dress – made entirely out of recycled plastic bottles – elsewhere there is work from brands like Christian Dior and Dries Van Noten. The exhibition also spotlights designers like Vivienne Westwood and protest groups like Fashion Revolution, who campaign to highlight the increasing environmental damage wrought by the textile industry. In addition to what designers should be doing to make a difference, controversial garments such as corsets made of whalebone are included to focus on what we need to move away from. Fashioned from Nature will run from April 21 2018 - November 27 2019 at the V&A.

"In April of this year, Hedi Slimane left Saint Laurent after three and a half years as creative director. Unfortunately, like many break-ups, things got a bit messy and, in June, it emerged that the designer was suing his former employer. After a lawsuit, Saint Laurent’s owner Kering was ordered to pay Slimane a sum of $13 million. Today, just nine days after his successor Anthony Vaccarello staged his first show, Slimane, who famously never gives interviews, has broken his silence in an epic 22-tweet spiel. It seems that the designer is keen to get the record straight – not about the nature of his departure from Saint Laurent, but about his use of YSL’s logo. When Slimane took over Saint Laurent in 2012 he completely overhauled the house’s branding, changing it so that it went under the moniker Saint Laurent instead of Yves Saint Laurent or YSL. There was a backlash to this, perhaps most famously with the meme featuring the words “It Ain’t Laurent Without Yves” printed in the Saint Laurent typeface, which later made it’s way onto t-shirts and beanies. FACT CHECKING / THERE HAVE BEEN INACCURATE STATEMENTS ON RECENT ARTICLES REGARDING HEDI AND THE USAGE OF THE YSL HISTORICAL LOGO At Vaccarello’s debut two weeks ago, a giant neon YSL sign hung about the venue and the logo itself featured in the collection – remember those heels? And while it’s not certain who or what specifically triggered Slimane’s Twitter tirade, it’s clear that some people have felt that Vaccarello’s show in some way heralded the return of the “YSL” logo. But, as Slimane’s tweets show, this isn’t strictly true – he incorporated the iconic logo into many of his designs. “There have been inaccurate statements on recent articles regarding Hedi and the usage of the YSL historical logo,” he says. “In conclusion it is accurate to say that the YSL logo initials were in fact celebrated and championed by Hedi.” As you can see from his tweets (some of which can be seen below), he employed the logo throughout his tenure, from hundreds of charm pieces to the confetti that fell onto the catwalk during the finale of his SS16 menswear show. While Slimane’s vision for Saint Laurent was different to that of his predecessor Stefano Pilati and of the house’s founder, Yves, he had the respect for its heritage. So much so, in fact, that it fully met the approval of Yves’ life and business partner Pierre Bergé who said last year, “Hedi is someone who has a huge talent – that is indisputable. He has a real vision... That is what I think. I like him very much, I like Hedi a lot – a lot.”

"Over the course of the last year, conversations surrounding gender expression have gained considerable momentum, as the line between the traditional male and female binaries grow increasingly blurred and the cultural landscape begins to shift. These conversations haven't been lost on the fashion industry. Identifying as gender-neutral myself, I’ve been flooded with excitement to see more and more designers choosing to create gender neutral lines. But though the topic is now, at least, on the table, what’s actually happening on a practical level is a far cry from where things need to be. I recently went shopping with a female-identifying friend. Upon entering the store (which has more of a progressive reputation than most) a row of models physically separated menswear from womenswear – when she went left, I went right. Gone was our shared shopping experience. Given a positive slant, fashion’s burgeoning acceptance of gender fluidity does show promise. But for the most part, the conversation lacks depth and nuance when it comes to tilting the binary. Over the last few years, a number of high-end and high street brands have entered into the market seeking to cater for gender neutral customers, and the 2018 nominees were credited for “treading a unisex line” according to WWD. Where the likes of Charles Jeffrey, 69US, and Eckhaus Latta show a natural propensity toward gender neutrality within their collections, others joining the movement show less consideration as to what a move like that actually means. H&M and Zara, for example, have both presented ‘gender neutral’ offerings of hoodies, sweatshirts and t-shirts designed for both men and women. But while their intentions may have been positive, each collection was merchandised either within the menswear or womenswear section of both stores, meaning gender neutral customers still had to make a decision as to which to head for. For the most part, my rejection of the male-female fashion dichotomy means heading straight to the menswear section, and all the old signposts still mark my decision. Despite brands’ efforts, I’m not able to make purchases without physically (or digitally) placing myself within one category or the other. As with the history of medicine, signposts, and even language, it’s that which is male which is seen as ‘neutral’. Past that first hurdle, comes a second obstacle: from the selection of styles on offer, I face choices that may fit my gender presentation, but won't fit my body. I was born female, identify as gender neutral, and wear menswear. Is it really that revolutionary for me to wear trousers and muted colours? Why does the fashion industry assume I’m breaking convention rather that choosing a desired ambivalence? And while I don’t want to downplay the merits of clothing lines that advocate for girls who don’t want to wear pink, on the other end of the spectrum, there is little done to acknowledge those born male who do not wish to only wear menswear. Gender neutral does not mean ‘without any traditional female signifiers’, as most retailers seem to believe. Girls clothes appear exclusively for girls, but boys clothes are for everyone: the silent but apparent contradiction that undermines fashion fluidity becomes obvious under minor scrutiny. Why can’t dresses and skirts be gender neutral too? “Gender neutral does not mean ‘without any traditional female signifiers’, as most retailers seem to believe” For the most part, brands are not pushing current definitions of gender expression. Instead, we see traditional men’s styles presented as a blanket statement which capitalise on existing social movements and the political consciousness of consumers. It’s a pattern that both excludes and insults the non-binary, transgender, and non-conforming individuals that brands have the opportunity to appeal to. At the moment, the emergence of gender neutral lines that are literally just menswear feel like less of a move towards increased equality, and more an indication of ambient cultural misogyny – ideas that femininity is invalid and masculinity is standard. Where the likes of H&M and Zara’s endeavours into gender fluid or neutral offerings failed, there are some doing things right, though. Phluid Project, which opened in New York recently, is the city’s first dedicated space that displays gender neutral clothing in a manner that rejects the male-female binary. Elsewhere, in 2017, British department store John Lewis made the move to stop explicitly labelling their childrenswear for boys or girls, offering hope for structural change that goes well beyond other seemingly trend-jumping efforts. Still, as a non-binary person who strives to wear clothes without regard to gender, I still don’t feel represented. I want variety, not a one-sided bargain. Jeans should not be the only immediately comfortable garment I own, and if jeans can be gender-neutral, then what is the cultural roadblock that prevents skirts from receiving the same treatment? What rules do we need to break to upend masculine and feminine ideologies? Dresses and heels can be for everyone. We need the potential beauty of gender expression to transcend currently inescapable norms and conventions. So how would these actually gender-neutral ranges work? Accepting gender fluidity, designs must account for the variety of body types related to assigned sex; gender neutral clothing needs to fit all shapes. Size ranges should expand to accommodate body shape, comparable to waist and leg length when purchasing jeans. Gender Free World, for example, has created their own sizing method which completely eradicates the need for numbers: instead, it consists of a series of names that correspond to different body types. SK Manor Hill has drawstrings on all their trousers to accommodate its customers’ varying shapes, while Seeker solves the fitting problem with elastic waistbands and two ways to fasten – a tie or a button. Elsewhere, the black and queer-owned Kris Harring blends masculine and feminine design elements in a culturally necessary manner. “Jeans should not be the only immediately comfortable garment I own, and if jeans can be gender-neutral, then what is the cultural roadblock that prevents skirts from receiving the same treatment?” Such diversity and customisation should not remain limited to a small, exclusive, and often expensive, range of labels, though. By attempting to sell gender neutral fashion, the industry fails to promote diversity in a way that invites productive conversation about gender expression. We need to hold fashion brands accountable for their role in the contemporary curation of gender. According to a study by GLAAD, 12 per cent of young people now identify as something other than cisgender, meaning that increased representation is non-negotiable. To move forward from here, non-binary individuals need to be present for all steps of the design and production process, both of garments and retail spaces. If my body doesn’t fit into existing style categories, then I need to be able to help make the new criteria. To refuse such choice pushes me back to where I started, and forces me to continue making a decision between two mannequins that mean nothing to me. There are no two ways about it. It’s time the wider fashion industry cemented their commitment to designing for our new, real, and widening-gendered world.

"In today’s rather surprising fashion news, Donatella Versace is teaming up with Zayn Malik. Several weeks after inviting the former One Direction star to sit front row at Versus Versace’s London Fashion Week show, the legendary fashion designer has revealed that she is collaborating with the singer on a capsule collection titled Zayn x Versus. Why Zayn? Well, apparently Donatella met him a couple of years ago and was intrigued. Then, a while later, she met him again through his girlfriend Gigi Hadid (who has modelled for her on multiple occasions) and knew she wanted to work with him. “He impressed me very much – he was so mature, so thoughtful, treated her like such a gentleman,” she said in an interview with the New York Times. “They are very nice young people, a lovely couple, in fact. And then he told me how much he loved fashion. It was then I knew he was the right face for what I had in mind.” “I wanted Zayn because he can help me talk to his followers,” she continued. “I want to listen to their language. I want to learn more about them, what they think and what they like. They are a new generation that without working with someone like Zayn, I will never reach.” For Zayn, who covered the summer 2016 issue of Dazed, this isn’t his first foray into the world of fashion design – as well as teaming up with Iron Maiden illustrator Mark Wilkinson on his Mind of Mine tour merch, he’s designed a footwear collection with Italian designer Giuseppe Zanotti. “I think Versus has always been a very cool brand and is a great brand for me and for people in my generation,” he told the NYT via email. “I’ve always wanted to design clothes and there’s no brand I’d rather design for than Versus. I like to learn about things I’m interested in and I enjoy being around creative people so I think it will be cool. The bonus is that I get to collaborate with Donatella, whom I love and admire. I know we’ll create something amazing.” The younger, more rebellious and rock ‘n’ roll sister of Versace, Versus has been synonymous with music since its inception in 1989 and, in fact, collaborated with another British musician, M.I.A, two years ago. Following the departure of its creative director Anthony Vaccarello to Saint Laurent, it’s clear that Versus’s relationship with music and indeed musicians is something Donatella is keen to foster. Later on in the interview, she alludes to the fact that this type of collaboration will become a regular thing for the label. “Zayn is clearly our plan for now. But I think going forward I will keep doing collaborations with other musicians and rock stars as guest designers,” she said. “It will be like our version of taking the brand on tour.”

"To coincide with the 30th anniversary of its first Just Do It campaign, Nike has released a new series that celebrates the greats of the sporting world. Serena Williams was first up, with her image captioned: ‘You can take the superhero out of her costume, but you can never take away her superpowers’ – as part of a statement on her being banned from wearing a catsuit at the French Open. Now, former NFL player Colin Kaepernick has been revealed as another face of the campaign. He appears shot in black-and-white, with the statement: ‘Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything.’ Kaepernick caused controversy while playing for the San Francisco 49ers by refusing to stand during the national anthem, in protest of violence perpetuated against people of colour in the US. In 2016, he explained to NFL Media: “I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of colour. To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.” The backlash to Kaepernick’s peaceful protest was huge. Trump called Kaepernick (and others who later joined him) “sons of bitches”. (...Right.) The controversy led to Kaepernick leaving the team, and he hasn’t joined another one since. Following the release of the campaign on September 3, some Twitter users started the hashtags #BoycottNike and #JustBurnIt, posting videos of them burning their Nike shoes – because obviously, burning footwear you’ve already paid for is a great way to protest! Others cut the swooshes out of their socks and clothing. Maybe a better idea might be to #JustDonateIt? After the campaign was released, Williams praised her co-star saying: “I think every athlete, every human, and definitely every African American should be completely grateful and honoured at how Colin and Eric (Reid) are doing so much more for the greater good. They really use their platform in ways that are unfathomable.” Nike has not commented on the backlash to the campaign at this time.

"Vestiaire Collective has become known as a treasure trove of pre-owned luxury fashion since it was launched in 2009. On the hunt for vintage Rick Owens, Comme des Garçons or Raf Simons? It’s likely you’ll find at least of few rare pieces on the site’s digital shelves. Also known for its collaborative projects (like the time Chloë Sevigny presented an edit of her favourite pieces, which promptly sold out), the brand has joined forces with independent specialist Byronesque Vintage to curate a special collection that celebrates some of fashion’s most influential designers. The collaboration between the two came almost naturally. Byronesque founder Gill Linton came across Marie Blanchet – head of vintage at Vestiaire – on Instagram and instantly wanted to work with the online platform as it shares the same ethos for beautiful pieces that go against fast fashion. “We’re ready to encourage more people to invest in better clothes and not put vintage on a museum pedestal,” said Linton of the collaboration. “It’s better to buy one great thing and make it last as part of a uniform, than it is to buy pieces because of the moment.” Offering 200 one-off pieces, the collaboration brings a unique collection to its customers to show that vintage is more relevant than ever before. From Punk to the mid-00s, the pieces are carefully curated by Linton who looked beyond trends and selected clothing from brands such as Comme des Garçons, Maison Martin Margiela, and Helmut Lang. There are even super rare items like Jeremy Scott’s logo trench, and Jean Paul Gaultier’s 1998 belted trench coats up for grabs. For the occasion, some of the best pieces are featured in a short film entitled ‘No Ticket No Coat’ shot by renowned photographer Derek Ridgers, that reference the club scene of the 80s. The video features cameos from the likes of Michele Lamy and Suzi Leenars styled by Byronesque’s fashion director Tara St Hill and takes place in Paris’s oldest club La Java. “Vestiaire is French for cloakroom and we had a simple idea to metaphorically fill the cloakroom, with epic clothes,” said creative director Justin Westover. “Imagine what the cloakroom at the Blitz Club must have been like.” “I capture people in their real and natural environments. People who are interesting,” Ridgers told us. “Byronesque talks about clothes that can’t necessarily be figured out straight away.” The film shows an underground club scene – a regular theme of choice for the photographer – with the models dancing to mesmerising electronic music. If you’re a fan of rare and iconic fashion items, you’ll be pleased to hear the collection is launching online tomorrow. Don’t hang around though, as they will likely be snatched up quickly.

"With a name that plays on the monumental publishing house – and perhaps its politics – @conde.nasty is the Instagram account paying homage to the fashion industry’s models, photographers, designers, and editors synonymous with decades past. Born from a love of fashion publishing and design history, the account is curated by Anna Reinherz, a 21 year old fashion student and illustrator who’s based in LA. Reinherz’s earliest fashion memory is watching The Devil Wears Prada at the age of 10. “I think that movie probably piqued my interest more than anything because I loved Miranda so much and all of her outfits,” she explains. “It really made me want to be a part of the industry. From there I started researching designers, models, and editors and as the years went on I started watching documentaries like Mademoiselle C and The September Issue. Soon I became completely engrossed in all aspects of fashion.” Reinherz fuels her interest by scanning the pages of archive magazines and extensively searching fashion databases. “I starting hoarding so much archive imagery,” she says. ""I wanted to create a space where I could curate my favourite images and connect with people that have a mutual appreciation for past fashion.” Each image selected has to be something that Reinherz would be happy to hang on her wall. “I have a very particular taste in imagery, so everything I post is very meticulously curated. I definitely love the 70s the most so I’m always searching for images of my favourite women from the era, like Grace Jones, Lauren Hutton, Bianca Jagger, Anjelica Huston, and Cher.” Reinherz’s favourite designers are L’Wren Scott (“I think that her vision of re-inventing old world glamour was absolutely brilliant and she had the most refined and skilled eye”), Norma Kamali, Halston, and Thierry Mugler (“for the silhouette of their garments”) and she’s drawn to the work of photographers like Chris Von Wangenheim, Helmut Newton, Antonio Lopez, and Guy Bourdin. “I love images with glossy textures and rich contrast. All of those photographer’s works have amazing creative direction and composition as well. I love photographers from the 70s and the 80s that were beginning to push boundaries,” she explains. Meanwhile, Reinherz cites the Bob Mackie designed ‘naked dress’ that Cher wore to the Oscars in 1988 as one of her personal favourite archive fashion moments (“Cher is the ultimate trailblazer for her ability to test boundaries”), alongside the time that Pat Cleveland descended from the ceiling at a Thierry Mugler show in 1984. If @conde.nasty were a person, Reinherz is sure it would be Diane Von Furstenberg, “for her overall message of female empowerment” – a theme that she considers a red thread running through her IG account. “I want young people to feel inspired and learn about times past and maybe gain some new role models. All of the women that I post are role models of mine. I don’t post anyone that I don’t admire and look up to in some way.” @conde.nasty

"From this Friday, Pharrell's iconic hat will take up residence as an exhibit in the Newseum, Washington DC. First designed by Malcolm McLaren with his then-partner Vivienne Westwood, the hat's fortunes were single-handedly revived by Pharrell after he donned it for the Grammys. By some estimates, it's one of this year's hugest success stories on social media – the scaled-up fedora that launched 100,000 tweets (and various own parody accounts). No surprise it's ended up behind glass. You can watch the official announcement here: Our hat has found a temporary home. See it exclusively at the @newseum starting on 8/22. #HatattheNewseumhttps://t.co/ofncD6CREU Fast-food chain Arby's stumped up the money for the hat after many compared Pharrell's headpiece to the restaurant's logo. After jokingly contacting Pharrell asking for their hat back, Pharrell challenged them to bid for it on eBay, where he was auctioning it for his children's charity From One Hand To Another. Hey @Pharrell, can we have our hat back? #GRAMMYs Hey @Arbys, you want my hat? Now’s your chance…http://t.co/CsW204Eo4R Arby's ended up paying $44,100 for the hat. Well played, Pharrell. Now some higher-up at the fast food chain has realised that they can't pull it off as well as the ageless production wizard, so Arbys want to share it with the world. If you're in and around Washington DC, the hat is available for gawping at from August 22 until October 26. Scott Williams, senior vice president of marketing at the Newseum told the Washington Post: ""The stories visitors experience in the Newseum illustrate historic and contemporary moments as seen through the eyes of the media. Pharrell’s hat is a great addition to the Newseum and will serve as a great example of the impact of social media today.” If there's anything at all you still don't know about Pharrell's hat, then head here to read this comprehensive secret history.

"“I don’t mind wearing high-heeled boots or a flower in my hair if I am in the mood. I think clothes should make a statement. Mine do. They’re the way I feel.” – Niki de Saint Phalle In her first year at one of the world’s most-watched houses, Italian designer Maria Grazia Chiuri has spent a good part of it focusing her energies on women – she is, after all, the first female lead in Dior’s 71-year history. While a year ago she led with the statement “We Should All Be Feminists” (a reference to the work of writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, who was in the front row), this year the show opened with a t-shirt which asked, “Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?”. Rather than a cynical statement put forward by the designer, it referred to the title of a famous 1971 essay by the lauded art historian Linda Nochlin, and what followed in the clothes themselves was Chiuri’s case for the great woman artist Niki de Saint Phalle. A prolific French-American sculptor, de Saint Phalle was the centrepiece of the show, with her art decorating much of the collection. That wasn’t it, though – notice those heart dresses? The leather jumpsuits? Or the berets with little net veils? That was all inspired by her own expressive wardrobe. From her monumental sculpture work and effervescent style, to her shooting at assemblages with guns full of paint, the late de Saint Phalle gained recognition for her vivid, abstract work – created in a world dominated by men. Get to know more about her incredible life and legacy below. De Saint Phalle was a friend of designer Marc Bohan, who took the top spot at Dior after Yves Saint Laurent was conscripted to the military in 1960 and then fired. This is where Chiuri’s interest in basing this season on de Saint Phalle began – looking at images of the artist hugging and posing with the old Dior designer. Saint Phalle was a model through the 50s before she pursued acting for a short time, and eventually art. She had the look of the decade – adolescent, effeminate, poised yet bohemian – a perfect muse for Bohan, and a cover girl for the likes of Vogue and Life, with spreads in Harper’s Bazaar and Elle. De Saint Phalle’s early work channelled all of her childhood anger into her art. In a 1994 memoir she revealed the years of abuse she had suffered at the hands of her father and mother, from whom she had become estranged, giving context to the work she had created throughout her life. These early works of the early 60s – namely Tirs, which means ‘Shootings’ – saw the artist shoot at sculptures, canvases and huge plasterboard often embedded with razor blades, knives and other household objects, the bullets from the gun smashing suspended bags of paint, cans of spray paint and tomatoes which would splatter their colours across the artwork aimed at. Bonus fact: a picture of her shooting in a white leather jumpsuit inspired the motorcycle looks on show in the collection. Her first shooting event was held in the February of 1961, and in attendance was Pierre Restany, the founder of the Nouveau Réalisme movement. Upon seeing de Saint Phalle’s work, he invited her to join the group of French artists, of whom de Saint Phalle was the only woman. Here she met the peers with whom she would work for the rest of her life: from Duchamp to Tinguely. It was just months before that de Saint Phalle had become widely known in avant-garde artistic circles for her rule-breaking attitude, and in August 1961 Marcel Duchamp introduced her to Salvador Dalí. Together they created a gigantic bull figure, to be wheeled out at the end of a national bullfight in Catalonia, which exploded in front of the audience in fireworks and paint powders. By 1963 she had become great friends with famous kinetic artist Jean Tingeuly. While driving around northern France, the pair laid eyes on an old brothel in Soisy-sur-Ecole named Auberge Au Cheval Blanc, or the White Horse Inn. They instantly pooled their money and bought the place – converting the whole building into artists’ studios in which the pair, and many other friends and makers, would spend decades to come creating art. “The first iteration of these figures – known as Nanas – challenged the stereotypical roles expected of women at the time. They depicted women as child bearers, witches, devouring mothers, and sex workers” Perhaps most famous in her oeuvre, after the years and successes of Tirs, de Saint Phalle moved her focus onto exploring the various roles of women through sculpture. From 1964-1973, the artist made life-size dolls, first from soft materials like wool and papier-mâché, then from wire, plaster and plastic. The first iteration of these figures – known as Nanas, which is French slang for ‘Chick’ – challenged the stereotypical roles expected of women at the time. They depicted women as child bearers, witches, devouring mothers, and sex workers. Her later Nanas became more joyful and celebratory. Eventually, de Saint Phalle went on to sell these figures as inflatable pool toys, for which she received endless criticism from the artistic community which surrounded her. She ignored them all, choosing to make money to fund her future projects. In 1966, de Saint Phalle erected a giant sculpture of a pregnant woman reclining as the entrance to an exhibition of hers in the Museum of Modern Art in Stockholm, which had a title that translated to ‘She-a-Cathedral’. In order to enter, visitors had to walk through the vagina of the sculpture, on the thigh of which read “Shamed be he who evil of it thinks.” It sparked outrage and adoration across the public and artistic communities. Her first foray into making film was the somewhat autobiographical film ‘Daddy’, which was shot in 1972 in collaboration with Peter Whitehead. A surreal exploration of a father-daughter love-hate relationship, de Saint Phalle explored themes of incest and female dominance. The film preempted her 1993 autobiography Mon Secret, and has since been shown across the world at film festivals and inside galleries. While working on the Tarot Garden, she was approached by Silvio Barandun, a German immunologist, who suggested they collaborate on a book together. The result was her 1986 book AIDS: You Can’t Catch It Holding Hands, which was illustrated with bright images of hearts, dragons and figures. It was disseminated around Middle and High Schools, as well as medical institutions, selling 70,000 copies in its first year. Its aim was debunk myths and fallacies about HIV and AIDS, which at the time was incredibly stigmatised and mystified. De Saint Phalle was one of the earliest artistic champions of AIDS awareness. In 1974, de Saint Phalle fell ill with a lung complaint after her extensive work with polyester resin. During her time in hospital, she dreamt up the concept for her next, and perhaps most iconic, work: Tarot Garden. In Tuscany, Italy, she invited artists, architects and sculptures to create the first sculpture garden. Its building ran from 1980 to 1998, and up until her death in 2002, de Saint Phalle continued to add more gigantic pieces and small details to the garden that became the home for her life’s work.

"Designer Claire Barrow once described her aesthetic to us as “car boot sale”. Now in her sixth season, Barrow has succeeded in bringing the spirit of punk back to London fashion with her DIY ethic and subcultural references. In March, she put on her AW16 presentation at London’s Institute of Contemporary Arts – an event she dubbed ‘Retro-Spective’. Here, this collection is captured in a new film titled Move On which was created by the designer’s longterm collaborator and best friend, photographer Eloise Parry. “Move On represents a milestone for us, a change in the direction of our careers and lives, and putting the past to bed,” she tells us. This theme is something that I looked at in my AW16 collection... and also in my decision to remove myself from the fashion week schedule. But it also felt socially and politically relevant given how we are entering into a new period in history – for better or for worse.” Styled by Haley Wollens, Move On sees the return of some of Barrow’s former campaign stars and catwalk favourites such as Liv Fontaine, Imma Mess, Amy Kingsmill, Louis Backhouse, Susu Laroche, Ryan Skelton and Jess Maybury. There are 30 models in total and they sit in rows – as if they are in assembly – posing in the designer’s AW16 collection. “The collection itself was a study of historical dress,” she continues, elaborating on the concept behind her AW16 offering. “But instead of looking at reference images, I thought about the fashion images I see on Instagram and how they get embedded into my subconscious. So, I designed a collection that mixed multiple time periods at once, rather than just focusing on one, and tried to create something chaotic and modern.” Although London Fashion Week kicks off later this month, Barrow won’t be staging a show because she wants to focus more on her creative work, including her art. “I hope that by doing this, I’ll be able to work more freely and creatively which I think will make my work better and allow me to explore other mediums,” she tells us.

"Initial reaction: Gone ravin’ in stomping boots and neon layers. Invitation: Neon orange – an indication of things to come. Stand out looks: The slatted dress in emergency orange revealing peeps of skin beneath, and the maroon, randomly gathered and sheer dress with bright blue sleeves that morphed into gloves. Unexpected details: Deconstructed shoulders and sleeves reattached with lacing, ties and bows on sharply cut suits, and the criss cross of braces over white shirts hinting at bondage. Silhouette: Subtly feminine, with the suggestion of corset shapes in amongst the layers of neon. Hair: Like powdered grey judges’ wigs, teased and torn and tied to the head, with wired plaits and schoolgirl bunches. Shoes: Masculine brogues for the formal looks, and neon Doc Marten-like boots for all those raving bright layers. Prints: A pixelated camouflage on loose shirt and skirt combos, buttoned once at the waist. Model behaviour: Yumi Lambert in the ‘Yamamoto Army’ finale of deconstructed shirts and suiting, eyebrows blanked out and a sweep of white shadow across the eyes and temples. Left us wanting: One or two of the final oversized shirts in orange, black or blue, belted in neon. A perfect distillation of the collection.

"Calling all Supreme super fans. Are you among the group of people who would queue for hours (or even days) to get the latest merch? Maybe you missed the most recent SS18 drop, and have been hunting on eBay for hours for a branded pinball machine? Well, there’s some good news – some of the label’s rare items are going up for auction. Courtesy of LA-based rapper Shane Bunting – aka Madchild, Heritage Auction is selling off a collection of items that a hypebeast would likely lose a limb for. Among the items are a Supreme-branded ashtray, basketball, salt and pepper shakers – even a fire extinguisher. Elsewhere, there are gold and silver foiled skateboards and a thermos which wouldn’t go amiss this in London today. And what would a Supreme sale be without a belt from last year’s Louis Vuitton collab? There’s plenty more up for grabs (if your wallet can stretch to it) so get bidding now before the auction takes place on March 6. Maybe start selling your possessions, too: the basketball is already at $600... View the full list of items here.

"Maria Grazia Chiuri has been flying her feminist flag at Dior since she became the brand’s first female creative director back in 2016. Her debut collection featured the infamous “WE SHOULD ALL BE FEMINISTS” tee, and SS18 followed up with a “WHY HAVE THERE BEEN NO GREAT FEMALE ARTISTS?” slogan. So the riot inspired runway procession that ensued at last week’s AW18 presentation should’ve come as no surprise – things have been bubbling under the surface for a while. Unleashed by the #MeToo movement, perhaps? In another celebration of women, Chiuri enlisted female war photographer Christine Spengler to capture this season’s backstage shots. The appointment is fitting – Spengler is the epitome of a strong woman. For starters, she asserts she has not once worn a helmet or a bullet proof vest while working. Also, because female photojournalists’ contributions to the practice have often been overlooked in favour of their white male counterparts’, the fact she has managed to hold her own makes her all the more admirable. Spengler has dedicated her life to chronicling conflict and all of the women caught up in it and her work has been published in titles such as LIFE, The New York Times and Paris Match. She has also received many awards over the years, such as the renowned “Femme de l’Annee” prize. “I had access to a whole world of women, to which no man could have access” – Christine Spengler “I had access to a whole world of women, to which no man could have access,” is what Spengler told the Parisian house in an exclusive video interview. Her subjects were able to trust her – they would supposedly say, “this woman has a camera, she has the eyes of the world, she will be able to help us,” and therefore they let Spengler into their lives. On one trip, Spengler even donned a veil to be able to shoot Iranian women during the 1979 Islamic revolution, something that would’ve marked any man a spy should they have done the same. As a result, Spengler’s work is not your average documentary photography. The very fact she is female has enabled her to capture the more intimate sides to war. From photographing kids swimming amid military debris to shooting a bride stood next to a bombed building, she always cast her lens upon alternative scenes and settings to highlight the humanity between the violence. Her shots from the Dior show feature a cohort of models clad in the AW18 collection charging forwards like an army, in the very spirit of the 1968 student protests – the ones Diana Vreeland coined a ‘youthquake’ – that Chiuri was referencing with the clothes. Never one to stand by the sidelines, Spengler’s involvement tied in well. Adwoa Aboah, the outspoken activist and model behind the Gurls Talk initiative, was also interviewed ahead of the show. The set featured archival protest posters, feminist slogans and paste-up magazine covers, and the catwalk backdrop bore the simple statement “I am a woman,” because lest it be forgotten, it is enough.

"With colder days around the corner, it’s only logical that our minds have turned to what we’re going to be wearing in the coming months. And if you're looking for inspiration, look no further than these newly-released AW18 campaigns. Selena Forrest makes a solo appearance in Christopher Kane’s new-season images (shot by Alasdair McLellan) as she strolls through a park, while French designer Marine Serre – who debuted her Manic Soul Machine collection at Paris Fashion Week earlier this year – lends her printed skin-tight lycra leggings, tops and balaclavas to a photoshoot-turned-fight. After its collaboration first debuted at PFW in January, UGG and Y/Project show us how to buckle up with winter footwear. Celebrating both brands’ core values through the lens of mythological nudes, Dazed 100 photographer Arnaud Lajeunie reimagined Greek and Roman gods Venus, Apollo, Hercules, and Omphale under Y/Project’s Glenn Martens’ creative direction.

"Etnia Barcelona is the European sunglasses brand creating eyewear that mixes trendiness with timeless designs. Its ongoing campaign is a call to arms for people to #BeAnartist. But what exactly is an ‘Anartist’? Well, they’re people who subvert the system apparently. Anarchic artists and rebels and those who defy tacit conformity. Through ‘AnArtism’, Etnia hopes to encourage people to become a “rebel through art”. With each instalment of the campaign, a different art style – anything from surrealist to still life – is reinterpreted (or “reArted” as the brand says) for the modern day. The latest campaign in the series, shot by Biel Capllonch, reimagines renaissance paintings to exhibit Etnia’s new eyewear collection. The painterly backdrops, mock candid poses and handheld props of each image are accented with models from the AW18 spectacles range, and this juxtaposition renders the series a pastiche of Botticelli and Raphael inspired portraiture and the traditional fashion campaign format. The AW18 collection itself consists of 60 new designs. Varying styles, lenses and frames ensure all bases are covered – the ‘originals’ cater for those who covet classic shapes, the ‘vintage’ selection is infused with nostalgia for anyone with a penchant for the past, and the zany ‘capsule’ models are created in collaboration with artists for those who are unabashedly bold.

"‘Dazed’ may be the name of this publication and one-half of the name of Richard Linklater’s 1994 coming-of-age film, but it was also the word emblazoned across some sweaters at DKNY’s AW16 womenswear show at New York Fashion Week this afternoon. The show, which was the second of newly-installed creative directors, Public School’s Dao-Yi Chow and Maxwell Osbourne, saw several of these ‘Dazed Kids New York’ sweaters come down the runway during the finale – modelled by Soo Joo Park among others. When asked backstage whether this was a direct nod to this publication, the designers (to our slight disappointment) informed us that they were referring to ‘the feeling’. “We were just picking, twisting meaning for DKNY,” said Chow. “When we were growing up not everyone knew it stood for Donna Karan New York, and then you would see people would pronounce it like ‘Dik-ny’ or ‘Deek-ny’... mispronouncing it... We just wanted to play with that.” In the show notes the designers said they were “looking at logos and saying, ‘We own that’ and ‘DKNY started all that,’ but simultaneously having fun with it and admiring how much of a thing it is over 25 years.” As well as ‘Dazed Kids New York’, sweaters bore logos that included ‘Designers Know Nothing Yet’ and ‘Don’t Knock New York’. This season, Chow and Osbourne continued to bring the sense of easy-dressing that they have honed and been heralded for at Public School to Donna Karan’s namesake label. Their cast, which featured Dazed 100 models Adwoa Aboah and Ruth Bell, showcased a collection inspired by “strong girl bands from the 90s who were able to show sexuality with a tomboy feel.” While those DKNY’s sweaters might not have been a nod to this magazine, that probably won’t stop its family and friends buying and wearing the garment as if it was. .@DKNY logos: ""Designers know nothing yet:"" ""Don't knock New York."" #NYFWhttps://t.co/AJQjkqEWxV

"Last night, a crowd gathered deep in the heart of London’s 180 Strand, the half-deserted 1960s office building that, having played host to everything from Virgil Abloh DJ sets to New Museum art shows, has become one of the city’s most dynamic cultural hotbeds. They stood around a sheet of construction-site plastic which hung like a curtain, marking out an enormous circle in the otherwise stripped-back, empty space. This was the setting for an off-schedule runway show by Berlin magazine-slash-fashion force 032c, which, over the last year, has transitioned from selling its branded t-shirts and socks online to becoming a fully-fledged ‘Apparel’ label, having showed its first collection at Pitti in January. Yesterday saw the debut of its first women’s ready-to-wear collection – presented alongside the existing workwear-inspired men's line. The show kicked off when the lights began to flash and the sound of German post-punk band Fehlfarben thundered through the space, followed by an unreleased track by Berghain resident DJ Kobosil. The collection that emerged was, according to designer Maria Koch, who co-creative directed the event with husband (and 032c mag editor in chief) Joerg Koch, inspired by her youth clubbing in Berlin. “I was a rave kid, a real rave kid,” she said backstage afterwards. “When I was into rave culture, you had the feeling that this was really something, that you were part of a community, that it was a special moment,”. The collection was prompted by her considering what she could gap she could fill in the amorphous, “everything and nothing” world of streetwear. “It’s nothing to do with the 90s in the way they are everywhere now – it’s more autobiographical.” While the utilitarian menswear more explicitly channelled the rave inspiration through pastel tie-dye tees and bungee toggle parachute pants, the womenswear was less literal. Styled by the magazine’s own Marc Goehring, models walked in sheer, tit-flashing tops decorated with sequins, and trousers accessorised with bondage straps. There were also references to armour and thigh-high hardcore leather boots with soles made for stomping. “It’s the idea of when you’re going out and you know it’s going to be a wild night,” Koch surmised. In other words, expect to catch a glimpse of these clothes on a dancefloor near you soon.

"Choupette – Mademoiselle Choupette to those who don’t know her personally – needs no introduction, but for those who have somehow missed it, she’s Karl Lagerfeld’s cat. Adopted (okay, kind of cat-napped) by the Chanel and Fendi designer from model Baptiste Giabiconi who lent Lagerfeld the kitty in 2011, she quickly became a social media icon – gaining over 100k followers on an officially unofficial Instagram. To say that Choupette is the world’s chicest cat is an understatement. She’s the Miu Miu to your cat’s meow, the Féline to your cat’s feline – you get the picture. She wants for nothing, spending the majority of her days either sleeping, flying on private jets, or tweeting. Needless to say, she’s living the dream. To celebrate International Cat Day (yes, really) we’ve rounded up some of the life lessons you can learn from fashion’s fave feline. As you can imagine, anything Mademoiselle Choupette wants, she gets. When it comes to travel, only the best will do, as revealed in a #exclusive interview on Karl Lagerfeld’s website. Among Choupette’s travel essentials are her luggage (custom-made, of course), her iPad, and Goyard plates that are personally made just for her. As for whether she ever gets jet-lagged, her answer is simple: “Impossible. Even on a plane I sleep well, surrounded by fine sheets and soft pillows, so I’m well rested when we land. Doesn’t your plane have a bedroom?” When Karl Lagerfeld being your daddy isn’t the most iconic thing about you, you know you’re doing something right. She’s appeared in shoots (alone and with Karl), on multiple Vogue covers, and once stole the limelight from Gisele. Sadly, you can’t have your own Choupette as there is only one. But, as King Karl is so charitable, he allowed for the fashionable feline to be immortalised in stuffed form and can be yours for a mere $600. What’re you waiting for?! Getting constantly pampered sure must be exhausting, which probably explains why Choupette is always so tired. Obviously Karl isn’t there to look after her 24/7, but her maids (plural) keep him updated with her daily routine. They also brush her fur twice a day, naturally. Even with all that sleep, she still wants more Lagerfeld explained to Harper’s Bazaar: “When I want to write letters, she sits on the papers because she doesn’t want me to write.” Diva! While Choupette does spend a lot of her time sleeping (see above) when she does arise, it’s only for big bucks. Sure, Linda Evangelista infamously wouldn’t get out of bed for less than $10,000, but that’s petty cash to Mdme Choupette. In an interview with The Cut in 2015, Lagerfeld revealed Choupette had banked over $3 million in the kitty (pun intended) from only two modelling gigs. She’s got a make-up collection too with Japanese brand Shu Uemura, not that she would ever need it as a natural beauty. We don’t officially know what Choupette’s net worth is, but you can bet she isn’t getting texts from the bank telling her she’s gone into her overdraft again. ’What could a cat possibly have to say?’ might be crossing your mind, but Choupette has a lot to say. With over 50k followers on her spoof Twitter (run by a woman called Ashley Tschudin) she constantly bless us with pearls of wisdom – “Rosé is just summer water” and “I thought I’d gotten into bad catfights… until I saw the Sarah Jessica Parker & Kim Cattrall fight!” More seriously, Choupette’s online diary reveals her serious, journalistic side with reviews about how terrible NYFW is and how great Chanel is. Question: can cats win a Pulitzer Prize?

"In the city of Ocala, Florida, it now really is possible to commit fashion crimes. In what might be one of the most draconian measures taken against an aesthetic trend in recent memory, the Ocala City Council voted unaminously to pass a law that prohibits anyone from wearing their pants two inches below their waistline and exposing their underwear. ""I just think it's disgraceful to show your underwear,"" councilwoman Mary Rich told WFTV. ""We try to be a nice, clean city. I think it'll help clean it up some"". ""Sagging"", or ""low-riding"", has now been made illegal for all genders and races who rock the look on city property – that includes the streets, parks, recreation centres, bus stations and car parks. Basically, anywhere you go you can be caught with your pants down. It's expected that the police will warn rulebreakers at first, but if they are deemed repeat offenders, they can land a $500 fine and six months jail time. Ocala is not the first place in America to outlaw low-riders – in the past year, towns in New Jersey, Louisiana and Tennessee have all proposed similar bans. But as Fashionista notes, the ordinances impose no more than a $50 fine for repeat offences. Which all suggests that Ocala City Council doesn't just have the fashion police on their mind; some residents believe that the law is just an easy way to fill the city coffers. Check out some outraged reactions from locals below:

"When you think of Nordic fashion, you’ll probably come to the conclusion that it’s nothing more than clean, minimal designs and the odd chunky knit. While that is true of some of Stockholm Fashion Week’s labels, Lazoschmidl – one of its most exciting names – is going against the grain. Founded by design duo and couple Josef Lazo and Andreas Schmidl, in short, the brand’s aesthetic is “conceptual menswear”. While you might be quick to label it as ‘camp’, and too extravagant to be worn by anyone who isn’t a gay man, you’d be wrong. Sure, there are the more risqué pieces too – a pair of jeans called ‘Ken’ have the back pockets cut-out to reveal a naked ass, or trousers embellished at the crotch to look like they’re leaking semen – but the pair want to make it accessible to everyone. “We say it’s menswear, but garments are not defined by that anymore, so it doesn’t matter,” Schmidl explains. Coming from different education backgrounds – Lazo a more traditional design route, and Schmidl a less conventional art route – they say their differences are what keeps the label constantly exciting. Previous mash-ups have seen collections inspired by cruising, the Backstreet Boys, and ABBA. “Josef is behind the dream-driven part and I’m more into research, with an intellectual approach to fashion,” Schmidl tells us. Being in a relationship obviously helps too. “You already have a coded system of things, you know the other person’s likes and dislikes, and what you both like,” he continues. Taking things at their own pace, the pair only debuted on the runway at Stockholm Fashion Week three seasons ago. Prior to that, they presented collections via limited-run zines that have seen them work with the likes of Bruce LaBruce and Doug Inglish – something they’re still keen to continue even with the addition of a runway show. “That’s our medium”, Schmidl says. “We want to create more than just garments. When we create the zine, the collection’s finished in a way.” Following the release of Lazoschmidl’s Inglish-shot campaign, we spoke to Schmidl about the label and what to expect next. How did you first meet? Andreas Schmidl: We’ve known each other for ten years and it was actually through an online dating website – before apps. I always knew that my plan was to find a boyfriend to move to Sweden, so I met this Swedish guy but then he was living in London. So instead I was going back and forth to London actually all the time for the first five years and so that was fun. First, I helped him put together his final collection and he also had to present it, so we decided on a book because I was into magazines. It was like a ‘do it yourself’ type of thing because his collection was based on many layers. The book was DIY with scissors and you had to cut the pages open to see the different layers. What was the starting point for Lazoschmidl? Andreas Schmidl: Josef was frustrated because he always wanted to become a fashion designer on his own, so one day I said: ‘let’s do a little collection together just for fun, just so we see how it goes’. You don’t need much money in the beginning to do a little collection of ten pieces – it was a one time project really. Then it was picked up by the press so we just went with the flow. How do you work together to come up with the collections? Andreas Schmidl: We start with the writing. I write up the collections so there’s like a story, a paragraph about some character, some space, some place and time, and then we write a list of outfits. Then we start designing from that. We can pick the story we want and it connects things we like and things we’ve seen. We don’t have to look at others, so it’s like a little universe in itself. It’s also easier to fit in the design process, to check back and still see the same character, the same story or if we need to lose or add something. It gives us a framework for the design. Masculinity and homoeroticism are big parts of your label. Why is that important? Andreas Schmidl: We felt that it wasn’t really done. Now, because everyone is out and there’s an LGBTQ+ movement, people think we’re so strong, but I feel we’re not there yet. We’re much further behind than everyone pretends, so I felt that we needed to celebrate it and to show it, but with ease and not with a political agenda – enjoying it instead. It’s more like helping people explore the thought around sexuality. Do I like it? Is it something for me? Am I free? Am I not free? What does my sexuality mean today? Also with the new generation of guys, they’re super open, they don’t care. They would make out with a boy and still be straight. When they come to the fittings, they want the sexiest outfits and you feel like that’s a new reality. It’s not about sexuality but sexuality, of course, is part of it. Maybe that’s the easiest way to trigger people. And from sexuality, the rest follows. “The new generation of guys, they’re super open, they don’t care. When they come to the fittings, they want the sexiest outfits and you feel like that’s a new reality” – Andreas Schmidl So the clothes are not just for men? Andreas Schmidl: We don’t say it’s for girls, but obviously the designs can be easily adapted for a girl. One garment, for example, is called the ‘girlfriend’s jacket’, so it’s cut too narrow and too small, as if the boy stole her jacket after a one night stand. That could be a reality today, that’s how boys dress. So the girl can steal it back, in a way. You only recently started presenting the collection catwalk shows. What made you start doing this? Andreas Schmidl: In the beginning, we didn’t have runway shows and we didn’t want to do a regular lookbook because they all look ugly, to be honest. Who wants to see a jacket in front of a white screen? Since then, we have seen the runway show as a way to synchronise the looks in a new order. We always try and place the looks into chapters, so you start thinking ’okay, this is the first chapter, these five boys are together.’ Then, the next and so on. It’s really fun too! There’s emotion, and the boys backstage, sometimes they flash each other their penises so they can have a harder, bigger penis on the runway – they totally go for it! It’s not planned, it’s just about the spirit. What are your plans to grow the label in the future? Andreas Schmidl: Of course we want to grow bigger, we’re both very ambitious. We started small to see how it works and we want to make it stronger, make it better, and work harder. The more publicity we get though, the more people expect from you and the harder it is to organise. People think there’s a lot of money but there’s not. Everything is self-financed. I also think that’s the natural thing of fashion. In fashion today and out tomorrow, and it’s hard to battle. We’d rather be out tomorrow, than be boring. If we start creating clothes in a literal sense, like jeans and t-shirts for a mass market then there’s no point of us anymore. For us, the difficulty is how to keep on doing what we’re doing but reach a higher scale, and not print a slogan on a t-shirt. @lazoschmidl

"Dov Charney is turning into that guy at the house party who refuses to leave even after you've pointedly turned off all the music. The American Apparel founder was fired by his own board last Wednesday for various eye-opening reasons, but Charney is now seeking legal action and accusing the board of pursuing a ""hateful PR campaign"" against him. Charney told the Financial Times that the allegations made against him in a leaked termination letter are ""entirely false"" and that he will vigorously contest the board's decision. He is now seeking legal action for wrongful termination and wants $23 million to $25 million in severance pay if he is not reinstated as CEO. ""I think it’s highly unusual that a board – any board – would indulge in such a hateful PR campaign against its founder,"" he said in his first interview since the dismissal. ""I think it’s grotesque."" ""It’s sad to me that the board are invoking sexual shame in a false way to advance their agenda. It's almost like mocking someone’s sexual orientation in order to advance themselves."" The last time we checked, allegedly misusing company funds and sexually harassing female employees doesn't exactly constitute a sexual orientation. But maybe we're just squares. In other news, a source close to American Apparel says that the board ""sees no point"" in meeting with Charney at this time.

"Think of Amsterdam and it’s unlikely the first (or second, or third) thing to spring to mind would be cowboys. But last weekend, as part of Amsterdam Fashion Week, boundary-pushing label Ninamounah brought a little of the Wild West to the canal-lined city – with the debut of its latest collection Evolve Around Me. Setting out a manifesto for the Netherlands-focused chapter of fashion’s ongoing exploration of the aesthetic, the designer sent a gender-skewing collection of wool tailored suits, oversized vinyl coats, stonewashed denim bustiers, motorcycle leathers, and more than a few pairs of chaps and spurs out into the upper-floor salon of a traditional Dutch canal house, which was built in 1622. In the corner, artist Sam Andrea sketched the models as they leant against the walls and each other, and sat down on antique chairs. “He’s very post-punk in his attitude,” explains founder Ninamounah Langestraat. “His work’s a bit like Larry Clark’s, in that he captures the outsiders of society. His paintings offer a snapshot of the heat of the moment.” Also on the line-up were (enormous) stetsons, silk neckerchiefs, (rootin’ tootin’) square ‘duck toe’ boots, and even a handbag that resembled a skinned frog, for those seeking to fully immerse themselves in cowboy culture come AW19. Perhaps most subversive of all, though, was a leather saddle designed in collaboration with Roel van Berkel for a human wearer: which likely comes as no surprise, given the Amsterdam-based label is fast becoming known for its exploration into human sexuality, and has more than a passing interest in all things kink. “The Western influence on horse riding was something we felt most attracted to this season – the wildness and roughness speaks to us,” says Langestraat. “This time around, we wanted to dissect perceived human dominance. We’re primates ourselves, but we don’t see ourselves as animals, and as a species, we’ve colonised the animal kingdom in many ways. Animals are ‘broken’ and forced into submission. The moment humans started wielding fire was the moment they started to evolve differently. This collection uses evolution as a vehicle to look into dominance and submission.” The rising label didn’t just show in Amsterdam this season, though. The presentation followed an appearance at Paris Fashion Week, where artist and Ninamounah muses Richie Shazam, musician Casey Spooner, and Nicolas Endlicher – resident DJ of iconic Berlin club night Herrensauna – were enlisted to take a turn on the runway, with Endlicher also collaborating with renowned textile label Weberei on a number of uniquely tailored pieces within the collection. “We met him in Paris last year, and there was an immediate connection – we started looking for a way to collaborate with him soon after. But we’re not really focused on club kids as a label, so we really wanted to do something unexpected,” Langestraat says. But while Spooner and Shazam might serve as muses, Langestraat has someone different entirely in mind when it comes to who she’d love to have seen wear the collection. “Pearl Hart,” she confirms. “A woman who came to America and drank, smoked, and robbed just as much as any cowboy in the Wild West. When she was arrested, she refused to be tried, telling authorities she would ‘not consent to be tried under a law in which my sex had no voice in making’.” Needless to say – stage coach robbery aside – we stan.

"Initial reaction: Westwood’s warriors protest through the dirt in gowns. References: Socially engrained tales: Shakespeare, nursery rhyme and the ongoing environmental drama. The look: Models had golden dirt splatters across their faces, and hair was pushed forward into a messy bouffant by Sam McKnight. Accessories: Bow and arrows slung around the waist, a Bo Peep crook, and a tartan rose flower head piece. The message: Continuing her climate revolution, for this collection Westwood wanted to remind us that 'everything is connected' and that we can all make a difference. Stand out look: The leather lace flower appliqués over sheer tulle. Atmosphere: The show was held inside Le Centorial - a former bank in the centre of Paris. Westwood filled it with smoke and models appeared from escalators. Unexpected details: Leopard print platforms, knee high socks covered in dollar signs and separate embroidered sleeves worn like hand-less gloves. Fabrications: Delicate sheer knit and fishnet layers, a pixelated stingray print and a red fabric that crinkled like paper. Soundtrack: Deranged opera mix by Dominik Emrich, listen below.

"Lady Gaga will portray Donatella Versace in the third season of American Crime Story, which will unpack the murder of fashion designer and Donatella’s brother Gianni Versace. The first season of Ryan Murphy’s anthology series dramatised the O.J. Simpson case for the People v. O.J., and work has been underway for its second instalment about Hurricane Katrina (Katrina). Versace/Cunanan is set to be a 10-episode depiction of the events of 15 July 1997, based on Maureen Orth’s book Vulgar Favors, when the Italian fashion designer was shot dead on the steps of his Miami Beach mansion by serial killer Andrew Cunanan, who shot himself eight days later. Cunanan murdered five people over the course of three months, and his motives for killing Versace are still unknown. It’s Gaga’s first appearance on American Crime Story, though she’s had a major role in Ryan Murphy’s other anthology series, American Horror Story: Hotel, and appeared in the most recent Roanoke instalment. Rumours had been swirling since the show's initial announcement that an A-lister was set to play Gianni's sister Donatella. When it was suggested at a panel discussion at LA’s Popfest in October that Gaga would make “the perfect Donatella”, Ryan Murphy responded: “You think?” Gaga and the Italian designer have a strong working and personal relationship. The pair walked the most recent Met Gala’s carpet together, and the Joanne singer fronted Versace’s Spring 2014 campaign. On her 2013 album Artpop, Gaga shows her love for the designer with track “Donatella”. It’s expected to begin production early next year, as filming starts on the show’s second season.

"Today, Time magazine unveiled its annual list of the most influential people in the world. This year, visionary Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama is ranked on the list – and Marc Jacobs has penned a tribute to her. In this tribute, which is entitled “The eternal radical”, the designer recalls their first meeting (apparently she was wearing “a coloured wig and a caftan-like creation of hers”) and goes on to say how he admires her “unapologetic dedication to her vision”. After meeting in 2006, the pair went on to work together during Jacobs’ 16-year tenure as Louis Vuitton’s creative director, collaborating on a capsule collection in 2012, which featured the Kusama’s signature spots on everything from the drop-waisted dresses to the silk scarves, and installations that filled the brand’s shop windows worldwide. “When people look back at her work decades from now,” he finishes, “they’ll see that her idea of creation and infinity has an eternal endurance”. As well as Kusama, Givenchy’s artistic director Riccardo Tisci features on Time’s list. The magazine enlisted fellow designer Donatella Versace to write his tribute, in which she describes Tisci as “so brave and fearless” and says that “he must have Versace blood somewhere in his body”. Aside from Tisci, the only other fashion industry members to feature on the list are Chinese couturier Guo Pei and model, businesswoman and philanthropist Karlie Kloss who, in her tribute, designer Diane von Furstenberg describes as “the epitome of the ideal American millennial woman”.

"When I was eight years old, I made up my mind that I wanted to become an actress, thanks in part to an admiration of the 1990s comediennes I saw on TV; from Miranda Richardson as the petulant ‘Queenie’ in Blackadder, to the troupe of women in Channel 4’s Smack The Pony. Above all, however, I loved the work of Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders, and though my acting dreams fell by the wayside, a penchant for the dramatic seemed to follow me wherever I went over the next 20 years. So, naturally, I ended up with a career in fashion. Subsequently, Saunders’ sitcom Absolutely Fabulous – one that I hardly understood as child, but would prompt me to drawl “pass the Bolly, sweetie darling!” at whoever would give me the time of day – is a TV show that I adore now more than ever. For those unfamiliar with the premise of Ab Fab (though seriously, what have you been doing with your lives?) the show centres on two middle-aged women working in fashion: Public Relations executive Edina Monsoon (played by Saunders) and her chain-smoking-pill-popping-bouffant-sporting counterpart, Fashion Editor Patsy Stone (Joanna Lumley). Neither of the pair, despite their supposed high-powered jobs, seem to do any work whatsoever, spending time in their own world of ill-fitting Christian Lacroix, guzzling endless bottles of Bollinger, totally co-dependent on one another for survival in ‘young and trendy’ 1990s London. “Got to have a life, haven’t I? Work should just be the little side salad, shouldn’t it sweetie?” questions Eddie in on episode. The additional characters in the series cleverly serve as representations for various facets of the fashion universe. There’s Edina’s hapless assistant, aptly named Bubble (Jane Horrocks), who despite an acute inability to function is made an Editor at Vogue; Magda, Fleur and Catriona, played by Harriet Thorpe, Kathy Burke and Helen Lederer, colleagues working at Patsy’s magazine with great outfits but totally mysterious job titles; and Eddie’s daughter Saffy (Julia Sawalha), the bookish antithesis to her and Patsy’s hard partying, totally irresponsible ways. “This month I want articles about how lovely spending money is. Expensive things are better, cosmetics are great. I want money money money, spend spend spend.” Naturally, the clothes in Ab Fab are integral to the plot, with each scene punctuated with Eddie’s maximalist ensembles (Lacroix, Escada and Moschino galore), Patsy’s power suiting, and Bubble, who dresses a lot like Grayson Perry if he were walking in a Jeremy Scott show. Conversely, Saffy is presented as a dowdy librarian, frizzy hair and round glasses offset with knitted sweater vests and a clunky ‘sensible’ shoe. “Everybody’s there! Everybody! Big names, you know. Chanel, Dior, Lagerfeld, Givenchy, Gaultier, darling. Names, names, names,” says Edina, rather aptly, in one particular episode. The cameo is also synonymous with Ab Fab, with the cast list reading as a ‘who’s who’ of revered industry names, too. The 2016 film in particular was reflective of how beloved the TV series was, with the likes of Jean Paul Gaultier, Jerry Hall, Suzy Menkes, Pam Hogg and Stella McCartney all saying a resounding ‘yes’ to making on-screen appearances – a testament to the fashion industry’s ability to laugh at itself if ever there was one. When the 2016 film came around, even Kate Moss was content to fall in the Thames for it. “This is the moodboard for the next edition. SEX BITCH ARISTO SEX PUNK WHORE BITCH PROZZIE LEZZIE PUNK TART SLUT. Oh but Alex, Alex – with lovely shoes.” Reportedly, the character of Edina Monsoon was based on 90s PR mogul Lynne Franks, a friend of Saunders herself. As Franks told Stylist in a candid interview, “Ab Fab was fiendishly funny, but also a show with a strong message: it was written by a woman – the brilliant Jennifer Saunders – with an almost all-woman cast, about a PR business run by a woman. It was also an opportunity for those of us then in the fashion and media worlds to laugh at ourselves.” Whilst admitting that the joke didn’t seem very amusing at the time, she continued, “When I look back at old episodes, I howl with laughter at the scenes that I identify with – Edina going on her own spiritual journey and hugging a tree; the crazy Buddhist PR on her mobile phone barking instructions to her staff as she walks through her office; the supermarket shopping trip where she gets confused and ends up with three full trolleys.” “The show’s affectionate teasing of an industry that can so often be harshly ridiculed and misogynistically dismissed as a vapid waste of time ironically proved that it was much more human than people thought” Certainly, clever caricatures of the fashion industry are few and far between. After Ab Fab came 2006’s The Devil Wears Prada, where the roles of Miranda Priestly and her assistant Emily played up to fashion’s perceived bitchiness, superficiality, and lacquered veneer. Although being an astute observation of the inner workings of the magazine world, the film failed to tap into Ab Fab’s universal appeal: that Eddie and Patsy ­– for all their attempts to maintain a similar Priestly-like façade – were as fundamentally flawed as the rest of us. When Edwina goes jogging in an attempt to lose weight (in an episode titled Fat) she galumphs down the road for a few metres in a carefully put-together outfit, before giving up in exhaustion. Relatable. And here lies the crux of the reason why I love Absolutely Fabulous with a passion. Yes, the characters it portrays may be occasionally problematic, but they are human and lovable all the same. Ultimately, the show’s affectionate teasing of an industry that can so often be harshly ridiculed and misogynistically dismissed as a vapid waste of time ironically proved that it was much more human than people thought. Although fashion’s landscape has drastically changed since the 1990s, and the days of company cards, constant boozing and nightly drug-fuelled parties are not quite so prevalent – the series is just as brilliant as it ever was.

"Cara Delevingne has modelled for a new campaign for I’m Not A Trophy, an organisation that creates awareness for the extinction of endangered species. In this campaign, the model and actor is photographed nude with images of these species – such as lions, elephants, gorillas and leopards – printed on her skin. “I am extremely passionate about animals and am so honored to be representing an organization and cause that is fighting for the rights of these innocent lives,” she said in a statement. Delevingne’s involvement with I’m Not A Trophy doesn’t stop with this campaign. “I plan on being very hands-on with the organisation and will do whatever I can to help create awareness for the tragic poaching and trophy hunting that is occurring in Africa,” she said in an interview with Marie Claire. While poaching and trophy hunting have been going on for centuries, their practice (which is still legal in many countries) has recently come under renewed scrutiny following the killing of Cecil the lion in July of last year. It’s not the first time Delevingne has voiced her passion for animal rights – following the death of Cecil, she auctioned her Tag Heuer watch to raise money for conservation of wild animals in Africa.

"For the first time in two years, Gucci’s sales are up. Why? Kering (the company that owns the brand, along with Alexander McQueen, Balenciaga and Saint Laurent) are blaming the 4.9 per cent rise on its new creative director, Alessandro Michele. Michele – formerly the brand’s head accessories designer – debuted his first collection at Milan Men’s Fashion Week in January, to critical acclaim. Following the swift departure of its former creative director Frida Giannini, Michele had just five days to put the collection together. However his new, Bohemian, androgynous and romantic vision was lauded by the press. Four collections and two Glen Luchford shot campaigns later, this vision has won fans, not only among the press, but among the brand’s clients too. But Gucci isn't the only Kering-owned label to be reaping the financial rewards of a change in leadership. In the three years since Hedi Slimane has taken the helm at Saint Laurent, the brand’s sales have more than doubled. This has been attributed to the broad appeal of Slimane’s vision (inspired by musical subcultures), his luxury-but-basic items and of course, the designer’s own cult following.

"Marc Jacobs has a powerful ability to capture the spirit of our times with a measured dose of both intelligence and perversion. Last night in Paris, he revealed that 64-year old actress Jessica Lange – who’s having a comeback with her bewitching roles in the series American Horror Story – as the face of his first beauty campaign shot by David Sims. With a haunting voice that Jacobs describes as “almost narcotic”, Lange is captured reciting the lyrics to Judy Garland’s “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” – a chilling take on the dark fantasy world of The Wizard of Oz. It’s only fitting that fashion’s greatest provocateur would cast Lange – who played a damsel in distress in John Guillermin's infamous 1976 remake of King Kong – in a defiant and unprecedented subversion of the youth-obsessed world of beauty. Here, Marc Jacobs talks Dazed through his Jessica Lange obsession. Dazed Digital: Why Jessica Lange? Marc Jacobs: I love Jessica, I mean I think we all love Jessica. This was really about her and I feel like the film was a sort of gestural moment, where people would look and see what they wanted to see and hear what they wanted to hear. I asked her to recite 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow', which has a lot of meaning for me and is something I’ve really gone back to. I mean, her voice I find almost narcotic, and there’s something so… It’s a bit like with me – there’s this hope and this wish and desire, but there’s always this sort of edge of melancholy or darkness. She’s just a strong woman who, again, I find so beautifully inspiring. What we really wanted from her was for her to be herself. ""Her voice I find almost narcotic. It’s a bit like with me – there’s this hope and this wish and desire, but there’s always this sort of edge of melancholy or darkness"" DD: Why does 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow' have such a personal resonance for you? Marc Jacobs: For many reasons. I mean I feel like I’ve really gone through fashion. In a sense, Oz is what fashion is to me. You know, there’s this sort of black-and-white life, and then there is this other world when you walk into fashion that turns to colour. But within all this glamour and superficiality we sometimes lose our insides. I don’t want to get too heavy, but it’s our spiritual side. Although the idea of surface can be so delightful about fashion, it’s important to return to something very meaningful. You need to embrace all of that surface and then come back to the comfort of home, you know?

"Fashion week may have ended for another season, but that doesn’t mean the industry is taking a break. Just a week after the AW18 collection was presented, Saint Laurent has released a new campaign starring Betty Catroux – muse to the house’s founder Yves Saint Laurent. First starting out as a model for Chanel, Catroux met the designer in 1967 and had a close relationship with him until his death in 2008. Along with other muses like Catherine Deneuve, Loulou de la Falaise, and Bianca Jagger, she helped solidify the iconic status of Saint Laurent’s Le Smoking jacket. With creative director Anthony Vaccarello reinventing the jacket for the latest show, there isn’t a better time to bring Catroux back to the house. Shot by David Sims, the model has never starred in a campaign before now and appears wearing a leather jacket and black sunglasses. Elsewhere she wears a rhinestoned blazer, and a studded leather jacket. In the accompanying video, she appears on a simple white background, still chic and effortless all those years after she met Saint Laurent. Watch the video below:

"After New York, London, and Milan, fashion month ended on a high. From Hedi Slimane’s debut at Celine and Jane Birkin's Gucci performance, to Balenciaga’s LED-panelled tunnel courtesy of artist Jon Rafman, Louis Vuitton’s gender-blurring offering and the spectacle that is the Japanese trio – Comme Des Garçons, Junya Watanabe and Noir Kei Ninomiya – Paris really was a grand finale. But not so far away from the glam of the shows, as always it was the more understated scenes that attracted Yu Fujiwara’s keen eye. The photographer, who has an alternative approach to street fashion, prefers to document the moments when the magic of fashion week meets the city’s everyday life. In Paris this season, Fujiwara captured Tilda Swinton, Michele Lamy and Virgil Abloh dashing between shows, Anna Dello Russo smiling at the camera through a decorative frieze, plus piles of garbage, skater boys, never ending queues, and even some baguettes on a motorbike – typical Paris.

"You’re reading Dazed so we will assume you already know who David Lynch is, but just in case, he’s the guy who brought you Twin Peaks, Mulholland Drive, Blue Velvet and Wild at Heart. You might not know is that he directed a perfume ad for Karl Lagerfeld in the 90s starring Daryl Hannah. Or that he created a line of athleisure for women. Even more unexpected is the recent news that he designed a jewellery collection. Entitled ‘Meditating Eye’, the collection features evil eye motifs on bracelets, necklaces and cuffs with the eye open on one side and closed on the other. “The Meditating Eye collection was created as a symbol, encouraging every human being to access that ocean of pure consciousness within,” said Lynch on why he chose the icon for the collection. 20% of each item sold will be donated to the David Lynch Foundation which works towards helping veterans and victims of domestic violence through the Transcendental Meditation (TM) technique. Lynch – who has been practising TM for over 40 years – credits it as helping his creative process that was “filled with worries and anxieties” before. Now he has found his inner bliss. The Foundation – that was founded in 2005 – also helps the homeless, prisoners and people living with HIV/AIDS. The Meditating Eye collection is available online now.

Having modelled lingerie throughout her career – from brands such as Victoria’s Secret to Agent Provocateur – Campbell is now turning her hand to the other side of the trade: design. Announcing the news via her Instagram, the model is collaborating with Yamamay, an Italian underwear company, on a limited-edition range. Aptly-named “IamNaomiCampbell” (her Instagram handle), the collection consists of bras, panties, slips, camisoles, bodysuits and kimono-style robes. Colour-wise, she’s opted for a palette of black and purple. As for the affordability of the line, WWD reports that the retail prices range from $32 for bras to $65 for a robe. Campbell herself stars in the collection’s campaign, which is shot by her long-term collaborator Mario Testino.

"Right now, on the streets of New York, the next generation of creative talent is finding its feet. Its presence can be felt everywhere: at runway shows in SoHo and gig venues in the East Village, all the way through to Red Hook, where a flourishing community of artists continues to grow. Among those making their mark on the city’s creative landscape is Manon Macasaet, a multimedia artist who’s worked with the likes of Stüssy, MadeMe, and X-girl, and earlier this year debuted a new film, Big Bad Wolf, with the intention of building a dream world its viewers can step into. Likewise, Lumia Nocito is making waves as a skater and photographer capturing not only her friends and her hometown’s youth, but stepping out from behind the camera and into the spotlight as an upcoming model, too. Fellow model Rahm Bow is also doing things differently, as part of a movement within fashion that seeks to dismantle the traditional ideals of beauty and gender. Away from the runway, where he works with a succession of labels ranging all the way from high fashion right through to high street, the talented artist somehow finds time to paint. United by their creativity, their view of the world, and, of course, a strong sense of style, now, Macasaet, Nocito, and Bow come together to celebrate the re-launch of ASICS’ iconic sneaker, the GEL-KINSEI OG. First released back in 2006, the Japanese label’s innovative, technologically advanced style was a hit with hardcore athletes, but this time around it’s found a whole different set of fans in a new gen of NYC’s creative youth. No big surprise when you consider just how well the sneaker ties in to fashion’s ongoing fever for all things 00s. With the group rounded off by actor Joe Apollonio and visual artist and musician Dakini, the five come together to interpret the silhouette in their own way, as part of a new series shot by New York-based photographer Matt Tammaro and stylist Marcus Cuffie.

"If you didn’t know who Ruth Carter was before this week, chances are you do now. At the 91st annual Academy Awards on Sunday, Hollywood’s elite stood to applaud the iconic costume designer who made history that evening when she became the first black woman to win an Oscar for Best Costume Design for her work on Black Panther. She accepted the award wearing a long regal gown, laced with blue metallic fabric and a dramatic off the shoulder floral train, paired with a beaded African-inspired statement necklace: in other words, exactly the sort of monarchical look you’d expect from the woman whose bold Afro-futuristic designs outfitted the mythical royal family of Wakanda. Looking back through her work, it’s pretty clear that the Carter’s award was long overdue. Since 1988, when she landed her first gig as head costume designer for legendary director Spike Lee’s classic film School Daze, the designer has been an unstoppable force who, through fashion, has skilfully portrayed past, present, and futuristic visions of black American life. Together with Lee, one of her long term collaborators, Carter has shown the world what a hot summer day in Brooklyn looks like in Do The Right Thing (1989) and the type of powder blue zoot suit Malcolm X wore as young Harlem street hustler (1992). Those 80s skirt suits and glittering gowns worn by Angela Bassett in her role as Tina Turner in What’s Love Got To Do With It (1993)? You have Carter to thank for those, too. “Since Spike Lee’s School Daze in 1988, Ruth Carter has been an unstoppable force who, through fashion, has skilfully portrayed past, present, and futuristic visions of black American life” Although Carter is mostly known for her cinematic work, off-screen her style influence has inspired some of fashion’s most respected designers and kick-started several unforgettable trends. Before Carrie Bradshaw donned a nameplate necklace in Sex and the City, Radio Raheem wore the now iconic ‘Love’ and ‘Hate’ nameplate rings in Do The Right Thing (as worn by Spike Lee to collect his own Oscar on Sunday), while Carter’s work in B*A*P*S helped bring the ‘Ghetto Fabolous’ trend of the 90s to the mainstream. This trend emphasised loud colours, unconventional shapes, and flashy fabrics, all of which inspired brands like Moschino and Versace’s chunky gold accessories and bold neon body-hugging looks. Ruth’s legacy is defined by her skillful ability to take popular styles from the streets of Harlem and Brooklyn and translate them on screen in an authentic way. She’s made a career out of staying in tune with the streets and properly paying homage to black culture in a way that other stylists and designers haven’t been able to. For over 30 years she’s given us glam and she’s given us grunge, and now with an Oscar under her belt, she’s finally beginning to receive the credit she deserves. In honour of her Oscar win, here we take a look at some of her most memorable costume design moments. The 1988 release of Spike Lee’s cult-classic college flick School Daze was a landmark moment that, for the first time, exposed global audiences to a dramatised version of 1980s Greek life at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU). For her first gig as head costume designer, Carter – who graduated from an HBCU herself only a few years prior to the film’s release – used contrasting colours and styles to separate the dueling sorority and anti-sorority communities at the fictional Mission College. During one of the most memorable moments of the film, actress Tisha Campbell, along with other members of the Gamma Ray sorority, and an opposing non-Greek group of female students wore sleek high-waisted cropped leggings, matching crop tops, and oversized sweaters for a memorable dance battle performance of the song “Good and Bad Hair”. Throughout the film male fraternity members of Gamma Phi Gamma wore fine black leather jackets, thin round eyeglasses, and letterman jackets to show their prestige on campus, while the male anti-Greek students wore kente cloth stoles, distressed denim jackets and baggy pants that were emblematic of the serious life of Pan-African student activists of the 80s. Grammy Award-winning director Spike Lee struck gold two years in a row with the 1989 release of Do The Right Thing. On one of the hottest days of summer, Lee’s character Mookie takes viewers around Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn to show off the best and the worst of the sweltering neighborhood. Because of the temperature, Carter outfitted most of the youthful cast in the colourful casual tank tops, sports jerseys, and athletic shorts worn by many Brooklyn residents at the time. Main character Mookie sported an all-white Jackie Robinson Dodger’s jersey, a nod to the once Brooklyn-based baseball team and MLB’s legendary first black player, with biker shorts and an African pendant medallion. One of the most memorable costume elements were Radio Raheem’s matching “Love” and “Hate” gold nameplate rings. The meaning behind the rings even received a proper explanation in the film and later symbolised the toxicity of white supremacy that was centred throughout the film. Although this classic 90s film primarily focused on the tumultuous relationship and career of R&B legend Tina Turner and her former husband Ike Turner, the movie is just as glamorous as it is gloomy (and trust me, it’s gloomy). This time around, Carter recreated some of Turner’s most iconic performance looks from the 1970s and 1980s, including her signature black leather mini dress and her gold metallic fringe dress. The designer got creative with the off-stage looks and incorporated classic styles of the period like cropped vests and the singer’s signature high-waisted mini skirts, which purposely showed off her famous legs. This was the second time, following her work on the film The Five Heartbeats (1991), that Carter displayed her knack for designing stage costumes for music-based films that elevated the original designs of the time. When two Georgia-based waitresses – played by Halle Berry and Natalie Desselle – head to LA for a music video audition, a random act of luck lands the two ladies in the wealthy social circles of Beverly Hills, California. Arriving with minimal luggage, even less money, and little to no knowledge of the high society culture they’re about to enter, the patent leather orange body-hugging jumpsuit that Halle Berry dons at the beginning of the film stood in bold contrast to the luxe city looks other characters wore. Carter dressed Berry and Desselle in extravagant and colourful looks that channelled the 'ghetto fabulous' styles entertainers like Mary J. Blige and Diddy had begun to popularise throughout this era. They wore chunky gold jewellery, clashing leopard print, neon two-piece looks, and gold plated caps over their teeth. As the film progresses, the women are treated to a proper Rodeo Drive shopping spree, with their resulting looks becoming more refined – although they maintain certain eccentric qualities by way of neon hues and metallic two-piece suits. And though it wasn’t well received by critics, the 1997 comedy is a must watch for the costumes alone. Marvel’s 2018 film Black Panther did more than just smash major box office records. The high-grossing movie sparked an international celebration of the various African music, fashions, and beauty looks that were prominently displayed throughout the film. For Black Panther, Carter was tasked with incorporating multiple traditional African styles into the wardrobe of the fictional wealthy kingdom of Wakanda. She pulled inspiration from the Ndebele people of Southern Africa for the gold stacked necklace rings that appeared on the female warriors’ and draped Angela Bassett in a printed traditional blanket indigenous to the Basotho people. For the royal family, she looked to traditional African monarchies who often wore hefty amounts of gold and beaded jewellery and exaggerated printed designs. The concept of Afro-futurism was also showcased in the film through the lens of young tech guru, Shuri, who designed a sleek Black Panther costume that protected the superhero and King of Wakanda from harm: a costume with such cultural impact it inspired thousands of filmgoers to dress up in African-inspired garb to see the movie in cinemas.

"When it comes to the four fashion capitals, New York is increasingly losing its commercial rep and becoming known as a city that’s home to designers keen to push the boundaries. From Telfar to Vaquera, Pyer Moss and Barragán, NYFW is a hotbed of creativity where important conversations surrounding gender, identity, race, and inclusion are sparked and discussed (and some really great clothes are sent down the runway). Joining the NYFW line-up last season was yet another brand doing big things. Founded in 2015 by Arin Hayes and Pierre Davis, LA-based label No Sesso made its NYC debut with a gender-subverting collection, as modelled by a diverse cast. Now, No Sesso presents its latest project – a short fashion film which sees the label’s extended family and friends take to the streets to perform an interpretive dance choreographed by director Sarah C Prinz. “We loved Sarah and her girlfriend Mo’s energy when we first met them, and I was immediately drawn to her. Once I saw her work, I was sold,” explains Davis. Those featured include inspiring members of the US LGBTQ+ community, including No)one. Art House founder and dancer Chris Emile, and Voguing legends Enyce Smith and Gia Banks, as styled by Autumn Randolph. “Arin and I spoke extensively about identity and strength and beauty and culture and vanity and hustle and perseverance and what the culmination of all those ideas actually looks like” – Sarah C Prinz Entitled Worth, the short is an exploration of the many factors that affect and inform our self worth. “Arin and I have spoken extensively about identity and strength and beauty and culture and vanity and hustle and perseverance and what the culmination of all those ideas actually looks like. Worth is a malleable word that felt alive and activated enough to embody all of those ideas,” explains Prinz of the foundations of the project. As well as physically demonstrating the idea of high self worth, she also wanted to convey those moments when it’s not quite so ‘up there’. “Our self worth is constantly evolving and changing throughout our lives,” she says. “I wanted that concept to be a part of the film. The piece is all about activating, embodying, identifying, and empowering our worth in a wide series of moments. The film is really about fantasising about all the different forms of power we hold and what they feel like.” Shot on location around Los Angeles, each area holds a certain significance. “The ocean signifies consciousness. The underpass with the break of light stretching through it is hope. The tree, family,” says Prinz. “All of these spaces bring a different subtext to each person, and I think it’s really beautiful hearing if people share or are separate in their own subconscious interpretations.” Or, as Davis puts it: “When it all comes together, it’s poetry.” Watch the full film below.

"Over the weekend in the south of France, fashion festival Hyères – responsible for kickstarting the careers of Anthony Vaccarello and Paco Rabanne’s Julien Dossena – launched its 2019 edition. Covering fashion design, accessories, and photography, finalists from all over the world were invited to present their work in the official home of the festival, Villa Noailles, to a stellar jury that included the likes of Chloé designer Natacha Ramsay-Levi, Craig McDean, and models Liya Kebede and Guinevere Van Seenus. As a platform that has been supporting young designers for a decade, the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Talents programme returned to the festival to host the finalist showroom, for both the 2018 and 2019 editions. Chanel and Chloé also returned to sponsor prizes in the design category. For the design finalists – who hailed from all over the world; Latvia, Ireland, Austria, and Taiwan – the show was not only an opportunity to present their collections on such a big platform, but also offered the winner the chance to present at the next Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week in Berlin. For last year’s winners, Botter – designed by Rushemy Botter and Lisi Herrebrugh – this year’s event was a chance for the label to present its newest collection as well as imparting knowledge to this year’s finalists. “You have to work hard and stay true to yourself,” they say. “We’re doing the same as what we were doing before (we were announced at Nina Ricci) but people are now paying attention to us.” And, perhaps most importantly, “Don’t be afraid if it’s shit in the beginning,” they joke. Here we meet three of the design finalists you should be watching. Paris-based designer Lucille Thievre looked to her mother for inspiration for her sensual collection. “I gathered a lot of pieces that my mother wore in the 80s and they were all ultra sexy, but also powerful,” she explains. Working with form-fitting materials like stretch jersey and lightweight nylon, the crinkled dresses and trousers looked as if models had emerged from the sea and hit the runway. In fact, the gathering was representative of Thievre wanting to wear her mother’s looks as a child, but they were too large. “The body changes as you grow though, so I wanted to add the tension so it’s very sensual,” she adds. Elsewhere, blue and white velvet looked like clouds floating in the sky – perfect for the Southern France locale of the show. @lucillethievre Roísín Pierce’s collection was intensely personal, inspired by the Magdalene Laundries in Ireland – workhouses run by the Catholic church from the 18th-20th century. Delving into the controversial history of her birthplace allowed Pierce to both spotlight it for those unaware and reinterpret it through her lens. “Mixed emotions,” she says on the way she was feeling post-show. “I didn’t want to do a political collection initially because it feels like a way to make people talk about you, but that wasn’t what this was at all – it was very personal!” Pierce’s expertise in textiles was evident and she looked at different techniques of smocking. Up-close the looks revealed a floral print that was stitched into the fabric. With Pierce taking home Chanel’s Métiers d’art prize, she will be granted €20,000 and a chance to utilise the Parisian house’s resources. @roisinpierce For Austrian-born Christoph Rumpf, his collection was inspired by his own journey from the small town he grew up to the big city. Cutting his teeth at Craig Green’s design studio, Rumpf’s collection featured oversized silhouettes made from found materials – sustainability being an important topic to focus on. “Sustainability should be important to everybody these days,” he says. “We know all about the fashion industry and the damage is does to the world, so I used a lot of deadstock materials and items I found at flea markets.” As winner of the jury’s prize, Rumpf will be awarded €20,000 by Première Vision, up to €20,000 from Chanel, and a collaboration with Petit Beateau of €10,000. That’s without even mentioning the most exciting, a chance to present his collection at the upcoming Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week in Berlin – set to take place from July 2-4. Stay tuned for what the future holds for the designer. @theglasspunk

"Donald Glover has been busy lately (even for him) with a headlining slot at Coachella and the release of Guava Island, his new film starring himself and Rihanna, and directed by Hiro Murai. Somehow, though, he’s also managed to find time to drop a new line of shoes with adidas Originals (first seen at Coachella, where they were given away for free via Airdrop) alongside a series of characteristically unusual short films. The line in question is called Donald Glover Presents (does what it says on the tin) and reimagines three classic styles: the Nizza, the Continental 80, and the Lacombe, for all the enthusiasts out there. Glover’s reworking of the shoes is subtle, but there’s a focus on deconstructed details such as uneven stitching, a custom 3-Stripe mark made to seem hand-painted, and unstitched edges designed to fray over time, all to evoke the familiar wear and tear of your favourite trainers. “Rich is a concept,” Donald Glover says, in a statement. “With this project, I wanted to encourage people to think about how their stories can be told on their feet. Value isn’t quantified by what you wear, rather the experiences from them. And you make the decision on what works for you, you live through your own lens. The partnership for me is about being able to exemplify what doing your own thing truly looks and feels like.” The films have a similar message running through them. Starring Glover and the actress/comedian Mo’Nique, the slightly surreal vignettes chart the marks that appear on Glover’s shoes while he performs various domestic tasks. “You got some sh*t on your shoe,” a passerby (the pro skater and Mid90s actor Na-Kel Smith) tells him in the first film. The Donald Glover Presents films also include a couple of jokes at his expense, told in a sort of motherly way by Mo’Nique. First, she pokes fun at him for walking around with his shirt off (a style he’s adopted at live shows since it appeared in his This Is America video) and then compares his stomach to a loaf of bread, à la some less-than-complimentary social media comments. Get a closer look at the new line below.

"After just one day, the SS19 womenswear shows are already snatching wigs. Last night, VFiles kicked off NYFW with a quartet of young designers – Elena Velez, MARRKNULL, Windowsen, and Shuting Qiu – presenting their collections, as well as launching its own new brand, VFiles Yellow Label. Designed by Paul Cupo (formerly of Hood By Air), the debut collection included slogan tees that read “Forced Into This” (AKA the eternal fashion week mood), and lots of yellow (obviously). Closing the show was none of other than rap Queen, Lil’ Kim. Wearing a yellow blazer over a yellow corset, her flowing locks were also – you got it – yellow. For the finale, the models stormed the runway en masse to Kim’s “Lighters Up”, with the designer and rapper joining them. Keep an eye out for more on the VFiles SS19 show.

"American Horror Story’s Ryan Murphy, the man who gave you Jessica Lange as a sadistic nun and Lady Gaga as bisexual, blood sucking vampire The Countess, has announced that Ricky Martin will be joining the cast of American Crime Story’s forthcoming third season, simply titled Versace. It isn’t the first time he has worked with the producer, appearing on Murphy’s Glee in 2012. The season will follow the first installment of the show The People v. O.J. Simpson and the still unaired second season Katrina. As you’ve likely heard by now, Versace will be based around Gianni Versace’s murder in 1997 with Martin playing Antonio D’Amico, the designer’s lover, a role previously portrayed by Oscar Torre in The Versace Murder in 1998. D’Amico met Versace whilst working as a model in 1982, and was his long-term partner of 15 years, up until his death. Martin will star alongside actress Penléope Cruz in her first TV role as Donatella (a job that was previously credited to Lady Gaga) and Darren Criss (from Glee and American Horror Story) as serial killer Andrew Cunanan. Although Martin has acted in television since the late 80s, this is the first time he will be playing the role of a gay man, having come out himself in 2010. Versace and Murphy fans alike will have a while to wait though, as filming is not set to begin for another few months. The second series (which will revolve around the events after Hurricane Katrina) is also yet to air and will premiere in 2018, with Versace following six months afterwards. A fourth season is already in the works and will recreate the infamous scandal involving Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky during his Presidency.

"Late on Friday, US Vogue announced what we all hoped to be true – the theme of the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s next Costume Institute show will be the work of Comme des Garçons and Rei Kawakubo. Set to open on the 4th of May, it will mark only the second time the institution has paid tribute to a living designer – the last occasion being in 1983, with an exhibition around the work of Yves Saint Laurent. “In blurring the art/fashion divide, Kawakubo asks us to think differently about clothing,” Thomas P. Campbell (director and chief executive officer of The Met) told WWD. “Curator Andrew Bolton will explore work that often looks like sculpture in an exhibition that will challenge our ideas about fashion’s role in contemporary culture.” A giant of both high-concept fashion and of retail, Kawakubo is a fitting subject for such a show. Since first debuting in Paris in the early 1980s with a collection that scornful press soon dubbed Hiroshima Chic, the designer has redefined ideas of what fashion is or can be – her clothes are artful, unexpected and challenging, with entire collections themed around single words or phrases. Her advertising is similarly radical, rejecting the strictures placed on the genre to instead favour work by Cindy Sherman or found photography. It will be interesting to see how guests to the Met Gala take on the theme. Popularly dubbed fashion’s equivalent to the Oscars, the ball is a charity event which marks the opening of every yearly exhibition, and sees celebrities and brands shell out cash for tickets, raising money to fund the Institute. Released in April, documentary The First Monday in May follows behind the scenes at 2015’s Ball, from questions of cultural sensitivity around the “China: Through the Looking Glass” theme to seating plan dramas.

"Belgian-Italian fashion designer Anthony Vaccarello, known for his sexy, body-conscious and often black designs, has just revealed that he is shuttering his brand. According to a statement from the eight-year-old label, the designer is putting it on hold so that he can focus on his new responsibilities at Saint Laurent, where he was appointed creative director in April. As well as thanking those who have supported the label, Vaccarello said, “This adventure has been amazing but I now feel the need to fully focus on this new project.” As for this new project, Vaccarello will make his Saint Laurent debut at Paris Fashion Week in early October. While the designer has already done a campaign for the house, hinting at a sexy new era for the house, it’s yet to be seen how he takes Hedi Slimane’s youth culture-infused mantle. Head to the gallery above to see Anthony Vaccarello’s AW16 (and last, for now) collection for his brand.

"Calvin Klein has been a bastion of sexual provocation since its Brooke Shields days back in the 80s. Thirty-something years on, the brand is still at it. Its latest (SS16) campaign – photographed by Harley Weir, another one of fashion’s rule-breakers – features up-the-skirt shots, hands-in-pants pics and a very yonic-looking grapefruit. The ad stars model-turned-actress and Dazed’s spring/summer 2016 cover girl Abbey Lee Kershaw, along with fellow actress Klara Kristin (who starred in Gaspar Noé’s Love), Kendall Jenner and Dutch model Saskia de Brauw. Now 28, Kershaw has been modelling since she was 16 but is now turning her attention to acting and has secured a role in Nicolas Winding Refn’s forthcoming horror film Neon Demon. “I’d never thought about acting before really,” she says in her cover story. “As soon as we started shooting, I was like ‘Ah, this is exactly what I’m supposed to be doing. I was always envious of people who knew exactly where they were supposed to be in life, and really didn’t think that I was going to be that person. So I was overwhelmingly filled with joy.” Despite focussing her energies on acting, she’s hasn’t given up on modelling – on top of her work for Calvin Klein, she’s recently starred in Kenzo’s SS16 campaign, shot by Ryan McGinley and Yves Saint Laurent’s Opium fragrance campaign, shot by Gregory Harris. The launch of this campaign comes amid rumours that Raf Simons is taking over Calvin Klein as the brand’s new creative director. As yet, all the label has revealed is that “an announcement regarding the new creative vision will be made in due course.”

"This morning, Gigi and Bella Hadid made their Chanel couture debut, walking in the house’s SS16 haute couture show in Paris. Gigi wore a cream gown with a matching evening cape and Bella wore a white one, which appeared to be constructed from tulle embroidered with rhinestones and adorned with floral appliqués. Their hair was centre-parted and combed, Princess Leia-style, into buns. While it was the Hadids’ first time walking in one of Chanel’s haute couture shows, Bella walked in the house’s Pre-AW16 show in Rome last December. Alongside Gigi, Bella was joined by Kendall Jenner and Chanel’s SS16 campaign stars Mica Aarganaraz and Lineisy Montero, the latter of whom starred on the cover of the Autumn 2015 issue of Dazed. Set in a Norwegian garden within the Grand Palais, Karl Lagerfeld’s collection took on an ecological theme this season. Not only did the set feature a house constructed from wood (which Chanel says it will be recycling), the collection itself was created using organic and recycled materials. Some looks were even decorated with strips of fabric that resembled wood shavings. .@Chanel#Couture evening capes (the last one worn by Gigi Hadid) https://t.co/y9f9TwPzMv

"It seems like we can’t get enough of animals in Gucci campaigns, and apparently Alessandro Michele can’t either. This time around, they’ve sadly left Harry Styles behind, but the cute animals are back to steal the show once again. Ahead of Chinese New Year on February 5, the Italian house has released a brand new capsule collection. Since this year marks the year of the pig, it is only right that the campaign is filled with the cute, pink creatures. Shot in Manhattan by Frank Lebon, the images show the pigs (along with their human companions) living a very Gossip Girl life. Chilling in Central Park, waking up in front of Gucci purses and living in a house with someone polishing the chandelier. All things that you wouldn’t find regular pigs partaking in, but these are Gucci-wearing pigs after all. The 35-piece collection covers every area of your wardrobe requirements. From cosy knitwear and brightly coloured women’s pyjamas to Gucci Supreme backpacks – this collection has got you covered. The best part though, is Walt Disney’s Three Little Pigs motif, which can be found on t-shirts, handbags, and trainers too. One of the standout images from campaign features a piece bearing the phrase “Do you believe in collaborations between dead couturiers and living designers?”. While the answer to this question may be debatable, the collaboration between cute animals and living designers is definitely one to believe in and one we hope to see more of soon.

Here is Noel Gallagher accusing Kate Moss of stealing all his crisps when she lived with him: Here are Kate, Naomi and Noel Gallagher in total awe at a Superman dance routine. ""We've done this in Mustique, haven't we?"" Gallagher asks Kate. ""At Jagger's house. We did a dance not dissimilar to this."" Here is Kate Moss deeply enjoying an X Factor cover of ""Earth Song"": Best part of the whole show? When Naomi is so delighted with her correct answer for University Challenge that she accidentally smacks Kate in the face: Jokes aside, the Stand Up To Cancer special raised £14.5 million for Cancer Research UK over the course of the show, up from last year's fundraiser of £8 million.

"You might not know this, but Christian Dior was fascinated by Japan from an early age, having grown up with Japanese artwork decorating his childhood home. The house showed couture there as early as 1953, but has never unveiled menswear in the city – until today. For his second show at the house, designer Kim Jones took to Tokyo to unveil a high tech menswear vision, complete with robots, a new artist collaboration, and more. Here’s what went down... What better to do the night before a show in Tokyo than go to the infamous Robot restaurant? Performers – both human and animatronic – put on a show, while editors and guests ate from custom sushi boxes, waved ‘Dior’ neon glowsticks and posed on the lap of a giant robot. Appropriately, considering that it was inspired by (and bears a very close resemblance to) Paris’s Eiffel Tower, the house also took over the Tokyo Tower, displaying a new, futuristic logo from its screens. ...including an additional version of the robot sculpture that stood at the centre of the catwalk, and a reimagining of the Dior logo, demonstrating what it might have looked like if the house was founded in 2197 and Monsieur Dior was, in fact, a cyborg. This iteration of the logo also appeared on the back of some of the models' necks, along with circuitboard-style stickers behind their ears – it was as if Jones had sent an army of androids out onto the catwalk. At Kim Jones’s first Dior Homme show, it was a giant KAWS creation that took centre stage on the runway. This time, it was an enormous piece by contemporary Japanese artist Hajime Sorayama, known for his sexy illustrations of female robots. (The artist’s work was also present on the invite pouch, which featured the Dior monogram alongside cherry blossom print and an illustration of a dinosaur by Sorayama.) As the show began, lasers illuminated the huge robot woman who featured in the middle of the spherical catwalk, shining down her silver body. The 11m-high piece, which has been in construction since mid-September, took 20 days to paint and weighed over 9000kg. Kim Jones was inspired by the “hypermodern reality of Japanese culture” this season, sending a collection that fused traditional craftsmanship with techno fabrics and futuristic detailing out onto the runway. First came subtly futuristic articulated tailoring, with slim panelled jackets layered over roll-necks bearing the new streamlined logo and shirts with digitally cut lace hems and cuffs. Most looks were finished with the Matthew Williams-designed chunky buckles and hardware detailing first seen at Jones’s debut show in June, on a men’s version of the ubiquitous Saddle bag and fetish-y harnesses, as well as bionic man-esque jewellery by Yoon Ahn. Also on the line-up were a series of metallic pieces, including a puffer jacket and one pretty stand-out suit – the iridescent effect made them look like they’d been dipped in oil. Had the models gotten too close to a robot backstage? Maybe. Including kimono-influenced wrap-over jackets and loose, cropped-to-the-ankle trousers, most of which were rendered in black leather and grey houndstooth tweed, and finished with at least a few chunky buckles. On the softer end of the scale, a number of looks – including a silk shirt and shorts set – featured a muted cherry blossom and android motif, as designed by Sorayama. All in all, it was a laser-beam-shooting, welcome to the future spectacular. Congrats, Kim!

"Last week at the Louis Vuitton AW19 menswear show, among other things, Virgil Abloh brought us glow-in-the-dark carry-on luggage that we never realised we needed. Now, he also presents ‘FW JENGA’. But, obviously given it’s designed by the Illinois native, this is not your usual Jenga set. Excluding the fact there are Louis Vuitton metallic inlays on each piece, and the cubes are made from plexiglass and feature the LV monogram throughout, the most surprising aspect of the sets are the price: a casual £1900. Yes, You read that correctly. Over a thousand dollars for the game, which can usually be picked up for around £13. What’s more is that each set of Jenga has 54 cubes. So, by employing basic maths skills (brought to you by typing the figures into Google), we have deduced that each cube would cost you approximately £35.18. Which, in other words, means it’s probably set to be coming to a timeline near you: most likely as part of a post from that one hypebeast who always seems to have the latest uncanny and expensive designer items first (but still lives with his mum). Whatever the cost, there’s no doubt the ‘FW JENGA’ will sell out and likely be resold for even higher prices when it’s released later this year. Stay tuned.

"Andreja Pejic has had her fair share of special catwalk moments, not least her closing walk as Jean Paul Gaultier's couture bride, set to triumphant can-can music. But her runway return at Giles' AW15 show at London Fashion Week last night was also notable for another reason: it's the first show that the trans model and Dazed 100 star has walked since her gender reassignment surgery last year. Pejic posted an image of herself on the catwalk on Instagram under the hashtag #thereturn, writing: ""It feels amazing to be making my runway debut for one of my favorite British designers #Giles"". The Bosnian-Australian model came out as trans last summer, telling People: ""I hope that by being open about this, it becomes less of an issue."" During her hiatus from runway modelling, she began working on a as-yet-unreleased documentary about her transition and landed a film role in Sofia Coppola's film adaptation of The Little Mermaid. Pejic wasn't the only star on the runway yesterday. For his lusciously gothic Georgian collection, Giles Deacon and stylist Katie Grand assembled an all-star cast including Kendall Jenner, Edie Campbell, Lily Donaldson, Erin O'Connor, Jessica Stam and Aymeline Valade. Anna Cleveland closed the show in uber-theatrical grande dame mode, twirling down the runway for a good five minutes in stiletto mules and a fan pleat dress. Deacon told us backstage: ""We had a walk-through this afternoon and the casting that Katie and I did was very much to have girls who wanted to and were able to have a strong character. That’s something I feel very strongly about, to see more strong characters and people being themselves in a catwalk presentation, because I’m so bored of seeing this homogenous 'bleh' - you know, gorgeous girls, but just all looking like robots from the same factory. I like to see what’s different about everyone."" Read our review of Giles AW15 here. Watch the show below: Liked this?

"We all know how obsessed Drake is with Stone Island – the rapper loves it so much that he even has an $100k chain made to look like its logo. While we weren’t surprised that he chose to wear the brand for the UK leg of his tour, one that we didn’t think he would team up with is Prada. The Italian house has created a custom wardrobe for his “The Boy Meets World Tour” which is now heading to Australia and New Zealand. Pulling from Prada’s SS18 menswear show – that was a collision of rompers, comic prints and bumbags – the custom wardrobe features t-shirts and vests decorated by black and white comic prints with each of the pieces labelled with “BMWT Special Edition by Prada.” The collection also featured the brand’s signature black nylon, that is synonymous with the 90s-era of the house but is also used in more recent collections too. Although this is the first time Champagne Papi has worked with the Italian label, he is no stranger to fashion. He has his own label – October’s Very Own (OVO) – and earlier this year he dropped a new single that doubled up as the Louis Vuitton SS18 menswear show.

"2017 has already been a big year for Molly Goddard. The British designer – known for her oversized, tulle dresses – was one of eight finalists for the recent LVMH Prize. Not to mention she picked up the award for British Emerging Talent at the Fashion Awards too. Her success continues, last week showcased as the latest designer at the V&A’s annual Fashion in Motion show – an ongoing catwalk series hosted by the museum. Joining the likes of Grace Wales Bonner, Kenzo, Vivienne Westwood and Gareth Pugh – who have all had shows in the past – Goddard presented her collection in the new Sainsbury Gallery. The set for the show space was created by Goddard and her mother Sarah Edwards. At one end of the room was a table set for a tea party, and at the other a giant, ornate bed. As the show went on models took to the table – and piled on the bed – chatting and having fun, watching as the show went on. The collection itself was a reinterpretation of Goddard’s archive – even looks from her first BA collection she created at Central Saint Martins. There were familiar dresses like the oversized blue gown that looked like a giant flower and reimagined pieces where trains of dresses were embroidered with flowers. In addition to the archive, there were also new pieces created specifically for the collection. Floral print satin and bell-shaped short dresses were Goddard’s way of paying homage to the space that has inspired her for years. “The V&A is a place I grew up loving and return to for inspiration time and again,” she said. Elsewhere, there were welcome additions to the designer’s growing skillset – sequin leggings, crochet dresses layered over rainbow knits, waxed tote bags with portrait-like prints. Following the show, it is clear that even as a young designer Goddard has a fast-growing archive with a strong visual identity placing her at the forefront of British womenswear. As it continues to evolve and she takes it in a new direction, we cannot see what her next collection will hold.

"When Riccardo Tisci exited Givenchy (the house he had headed up for over a decade) a month ago, rumours immediately abounded as to who might replace him. Now, in an Instagram post just uploaded to the brand’s official account, that question has finally been answered. Clare Waight Keller – who had been heading up Chloé from 2011 until announcing her AW17 show would be her last for the brand – is now stepping into the very big shoes left by Tisci at Givenchy, putting to bed those other rumours that it might be Off-White’s Virgil Abloh or ex-Cavalli designer Peter Dundas. The second woman to take over a heritage LVMH house since Maria Grazia Chiuri’s appointment at Dior, Givenchy emphasised their history in the announcement today, posting Keller’s photo alongside an archive image of founder Hubert de Givenchy. Sandwiched between, read the quote: “True elegance comes with a natural gesture, an attitude in simplicity.” Waight Keller will design womenswear, menswear, accessories and haute couture. She previously worked on menswear at Ralph Lauren and has also held positions at Tom Ford and Calvin Klein. “Hubert de Givenchy’s confident style has always been an inspiration and I am very grateful for the opportunity to be a part of this legendary House’s history,” Waight Keller commented in a statement. “I look forward to working with the teams and writing a new chapter in this beautiful story.” Although her feminine aesthetic at Chloé was more bohemian chic than haute couture, her appointment promises a fresh start at the house that will be surely distinct from her predecessor’s hip-hop, street, and gothic-inspired tenure. See her final collection for Chloé below.

"Is it us or has everybody become obsessed with footwear recently? As usual, we blame Demna Gvasalia. If we aren’t talking about the divisive Balenciaga Croc, it’s the highly covetable Triple-S that becomes the hot topic of conversation. And don’t even get us started on Kanye West and his slide saga. We’re still unsure on whether we should be wearing tiny or giant shoes TBH. Taking the footwear fetish to the next level, though, is Michaela McEttrick, writer and creator of Tabasko Sweet (a character played Nathaniel Contreras), who appears on satirical DIY fashion YouTube series Cheap Thrills (hosted on Super Deluxe’s channel). Episodes have seen Sweet offer tips on creating your own Lil Yachty Grillz, Margiela Fusion sneakers, and, best of all, some fake Gucci slides (made using red and green electrical tape). The next logical step in paying homage to a shoe that has become part of an urban legend is to turn a car into one, obviously, which Sweet and co. just did (with a little help from Donut Media). “Since the first ever episode of Cheap Thrills was about the Gucci flip-flop, it felt really natural for us to return to our roots in the launch of this new take on the format,” she explains. Taking around eight hours to create, the final result is 90 per cent genius, 10 per cent ridiculous. If you ever wanted to get you a car that can do both, it’s 100 per cent a dream. Unsurprisingly when they took the car out for a test drive, people noticed. “They were rubbernecking like crazy and recording on their phones in traffic,” she tells us. So what do you do with a car that looks like a giant Gucci flip-flop once you’ve finished cruising around in it? Give it to Bhad Bhabie obviously. “Her manager hit us up on Twitter and asked if we could surprise her,” McEttrick says. What could be a more apt gift to celebrate her song “Gucci Flip Flops” going gold? Her response… “Y’all couldn’t have got me cupcakes or something?” Not satisfied with seeing her creation out on the road, McEttrick already has plans to top the flip-flop. “I’ve got some requests in the comments about DIY car interior upgrades,” she says. “We grew up in the prime Pimp My Ride era and are interested in exploring the maximalist car makeover lane.” To see what’s next tune into Cheap Thrills DIY. A new episode is released every Tuesday.

"Back in March, New York-based photographer Petra Collins made her Milan Fashion Week debut, taking to Gucci’s AW16 catwalk in a red and gold brocade suit. A few months later, she followed it up by taking over the brand’s Snapchat and giving us a behind-the-scenes look at its AW16 campaign shoot – in which she was starring. Today, this campaign – which comes in video form – has been revealed. Shot by Glen Luchford, who has lensed all of the house’s visual under Alessandro Michele’s creative direction, the video features Collins and her fellow models driving around Tokyo in a Japanese light truck, or “dekotora” (decoration truck) as they are known in Japan. After driving around for a while, they arrive at an arcade, which is equally lit up, and play pachinko (a Japanese form of pinball). “The ongoing dialogue between the traditional and the modern – between calm and chaos – that characterises this vibrant place creates a psychedelic assault on the senses that is echoed beautifully in the vivacity of creative director Alessandro Michele’s creations,” says the house. This is plain to see – the bright lights of Tokyo are mirrored in the rich colours, patterns, embellishments and embroideries of the AW16 collection. Watch the film below:

"Alek Wek’s 20 years in the modelling industry have seen her bag campaigns and runway appearances for everyone from Balenciaga to Yeezy, Alexander McQueen to Marc Jacobs. Not to mention appearing on the cover of Dazed’s spring/summer 2017 issue with Grace Bol. Now, the model is trying her hand at styling – collaborating with rag & bone on its DIY project. Given complete creative freedom to do whatever she wanted, Wek was simply given a bag of clothes and a brief to create a series of images. Enlisting her friend to shoot the images, the model wanted to show how the collection has something for everyone. “My style is simple, wearable, but also quite chic – I love feeling high fashion and couture,” she tells us. “Sometimes it’s sporty too though and the collection has everything in there for all of those things.” Shot around Brooklyn and featuring her dog, Wek wanted to the images to have a relaxed feel, to show her off-duty side when she isn’t sashaying down the runway. “I love cooking, poetry, flowers, yoga, nature, and my dog,” she says. Of course, this is all while juggling a modelling career and her recent appearance in Luca Guadagnino’s remake of Suspiria. “It was an amazing experience, very humbling,” Wek says of her time working on the film. “Tilda Swinton was like a big sister and such a professional. I was so nervous and she just made it such a fun moment.” Thinking of following in Wek’s supermodel footsteps? Her advice is simple: “Stay in school and get an education first,” she says of fledgeling models under the age of 16. “Make sure you enjoy it, make sure you have a good group of people around that keep you grounded. If you’re in the public eye, you’re going to need to know how to deal with it and if that’ll upset you then maybe modelling isn’t for you.”

"Since launching in 30 years ago, Italian shoe brand Vic Matiē has refined its vision to become a label which focuses on the creativity of up and coming talents – including stylist, art director, and Nike collaborator Veronica Panati who has worked with the brand since SS17. As part of its latest endeavour, the label has launched a new initiative, named #thenewpowergeneration – allowing young Italian creatives to reimagine the brand through their own aesthetic. The project – that started in April and will end in July – is described as a ‘virtual residency’ and entails a takeover of Vic Matiē’s Instagram account. Selected because of their contemporary vision, the host of collaborators include photographer Marta Marinotti, director Giulia Achenza, filmmaker Michele Foti, fashion editor Moreno Galatà and several more. The images include the use of mixed media and techniques to “distort the original product in order the replicate its sight from a machines point of view”, courtesy of the team at Loom est. Elsewhere, Galatà styled the shoes with rocks and tree logs and Francesca Natali used her background in direction to create a series of minimal images. Continuing to use social media as a vital part of the company’s branding, the online residencies will be followed by an Instagram launch of the first ever Vic Matiē Man AW19 collection.

"On July 31, Live Archives – an archive of modern and contemporary fashion based in London – will be opening an exhibition devoted to Japanese designer Yohji Yamamoto. 60 pieces will be put on display at the Mare Street Gallery space – some which date back to the 80s, like an iconic cotton cut-work ensemble from the designer’s SS83 collection, while others are more recent. But this isn't your average fashion exhibition – for a start, the pieces will be worn by live models. Japan's noir maestro is famous for creating clothes that can be worn in multiple ways and these ways will be demonstrated. Plus, a selection of exhibits will be on sale. Yamamoto’s work has been featured in over 40 museum shows since the birth of his brand in 1981 – something that could be considered ironic given that he once said museums are “where fashion goes to die”. Head to Live Archives’ website for more information.

"The latest campaign from Parisian trailblazers Y/Project is here, and, as usual, it’s a full-blown family affair (cue track by Mary J. Blige). This season, creative director Glenn Martens and his entire atelier team piled into cars and drove to the outskirts of the French capital to shoot the label’s dynamic SS18 collection. Martens has long shunned the idea of glossy, over-produced campaigns and instead focuses on the diverse people and personalities that make up the Y/Project family – “Since my arrival, it’s all been about celebrating individuality,” he says. “I see a lot of brands pushing this ‘army-effect’ – once you wear the brand, you become the brand. You hide behind their logo. I definitely respect the approach, but for us, we want to do the opposite,” he finishes. It certainly helps that, as well as being full of personality, his team are really, really ridiculously good looking. The collection itself offers up pale jacquard suits in louche, boxy silhouettes, 90s-esque sportswear and beaded mesh bodysuits paired with barely-there ruched chiffon and wrap-around leather boots. The footwear is a particular stand-out as Martens becomes increasingly known for his subversive styles – his AW18 thigh-high Uggs are still fresh in our minds, and we’re guessing they might be in yours, too. Shot and styled by long-term collaborators Arnaud Lajeunie and Ursina Gysi, the campaign features members of the team lounging in the restaurant where the campaign was shot, gathering together for a family photo and, in one model’s case, riding a horse. When asked how that came about, Martens says “that was Arnaud’s idea. I think he just loves horses and wanted to find an excuse to go into the countryside and do some horse whispering.” We caught up with Martens to discuss the inspiration behind the brand’s SS18 collection, its ethos of celebrating individuals, and the watertight creative bond he, Lajeunie and Gysi share. What was the starting point for the collection, how did it evolve from AW17? Glenn Martens: The starting point of all collections is construction. I guess it’s a leftover of my architecture studies. We develop concepts and twists which we project onto different product groups. Once we fall in love with some technique, we start giving form and colour to the globality of the collection. One of our biggest SS18 stories is the merging of different pieces into one. You don’t really know where one piece starts and where the other one ends. Some of our pieces therefore have up to five different ways they can be worn. It's fun! I still discover new ways of wearing certain designs shown last June. What was the inspiration behind it? Glenn Martens: We take any reference we like regardless of era or subculture. It is a very emotional process. There’s no rule, it just happens, we do what we want and try to find some balance in between the extremes. Our collection plan therefore flirts with streetwear, sportswear, couture, tailoring. It’s a kind of celebration of this huge melting pot we’re living in. Paris is a never-ending source of inspiration, too. There’s all the great history, but it’s also a metropole embracing many different cultures. We want to talk to all kinds of different people from many different backgrounds. Tell us a bit about the shoot, what was the process and what did you want to portray? Glenn Martens: Each photograph is an individual story, focusing on an individual personality. The campaign concept was developed hand-in-hand with my photographer Arnaud Lajeunie and stylist Ursina Gysi. The three of us have an equal voice in the artistic development of each visual. Production is of course very tricky as we often shoot on location. It really takes one full day for each single image. We all have tight schedules so it’s impossible to always have all three of us present on the set. But then again, we work so closely together that we have blind trust in each other. I can easily be absent on a shoot in full confidence that the two of them will make an amazing visual that perfectly reflects the identity of the brand. I’m very blessed to have found them. “My full team, including all our interns are in that group picture, and I was especially excited to see it. I’m extremely proud of all we’ve managed together in such short amount of time” – Glenn Martens Tell us a little about some of the people featured in the campaign… Glenn Martens: Each one is part of the history of the brand. Redouane for example is a boy Ursina found when she was street-casting in Les Halles (a shopping mall in Paris) He’s been in our last three shows and campaigns and by now is a part of the family. My full team, including all our interns are in that group picture, and I was especially excited to see it. I’m extremely proud of all we’ve managed together in such short amount of time. The brand today is about maturing and fine-tuning. I don’t believe one sole person can do that. It’s a team effort, which includes equal feedback; from the commercial team, the production team, and the creative team. It was very important to me to have this image in our series. Why is the focus on individuals such an important part of Y/Project campaigns? Glenn Martens: Since my arrival, Y/Project has been all about celebrating individuality. A lot of the clothes we propose are conceived to be totally versatile. The idea is that they have to grow on your personality, we invite our customer to make a choice, you need to own the piece. “How do I feel today? How do I want to wear this garment?” - the different answers can often be found in one single item. I think this freedom, this fun factor, is what triggers people.

"Following on from the brand’s campaign starring Dazed cover star Kendall Jenner earlier this year, Calvin Klein Jeans has unveiled its new AW15 visuals shot by Mario Sorrenti. In what the brand has described as “an innovative sociological experiment turned fashion campaign”, Calvin has delved into the world of digital dating. The campaign stars a cast of models and actors pictured in suggestive positions, along with screenshots from a real-life online encounter. Both a gay and three-way couple are thrown into this sexually-charged mix. These ‘sexts’ include “Hahah a light threesome never hurt anyone,” “You know he's not as good as me,” and “We gotta buy your roommate some ear plugs”. “Through this campaign, we’re creating an emotional connection with today’s technology driven generation, highlighting the new normal channel for modern meet-ups,” said Melisa Goldie, Chief Marketing Officer of Calvin Klein. Obviously the brand has a reputation for sexually provocative advertisements – one that dates back to a 15-year-old Brooke Shield’s iconic “Do you know what comes between me and my Calvins? Nothing” campaign in 1980. Watch the brand's AW15 campaign film below:

"Proenza Schouler's SS15 show in September presented what we could only term as ""Sinister Prep"" – a vision of all-American classics and sportswear, as seen through Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez's dark lens of modernity. It was a laser-cut vision of eelskin, python and leather; even a humble polo dress was slashed in two at the breast with a strip of snakeskin. Perhaps unsurprisingly, McCollough and Hernandez wanted to lighten the mood for its spring ads. In this exclusive preview from the forthcoming campaign, David Sims shoots rising star Julia Bergshoeff in a grey knit polo with an inset band of leather and a blue lace knit skirt with peekabo detailing. But don't mistake lightness for sweetness – the Proenza Schouler girl is tougher, darker beast than she seems. See SS15 below and check out our show report here.

"Future historians will look back on these times and divide it into two parts: pre-ALS Ice Bucket Challenge and post-ALS Ice Bucket Challenge. Truly, you are nobody until some Hollywood star, usually with a movie to promote, demands that you chuck a bucket of ice water over your head for charity. Today, Donatella Versace joined that list. With two topless male models by her side, the designer nominated Pedro Almodovar, Pharrell and Prince to take on the challenge next. ""I'm not just here to ruin my make-up,"" she said, ""Please donate to ASL."" Jean Paul Gaultier also took up the Ice Bucket Challenge this week after being nominated by new muse Conchita Wurst to take part in the challenge. This being Gaultier, he couldn't resist the chance to get wet by way of a muscly hunk in Speedos – although we think he's technically cheating, seeing as he uses a dinner plate cover to shield himself: In case you've been living underneath a rock for the past month, the Ice Bucket Challenge raises money for the ALS Association in the US and the Motor Neurone Disease Association and Macmillan Cancer Support in the UK. All participants are expected to give a donation to charity alongside their icy shower. Gaultier isn't the first designer to do the challenge. In the beginning, the Fashion Ice Bucket was the preserve of models like Cara Delevingne, Suki Waterhouse and their equally leggy colleagues. But once Anna Wintour did one, all hell broke loose. Mary Katrantzou posted a video of her soaking on Tuesday: While Diane von Furstenberg made everybody else feel bad about their summers by filming her challenge on what looks like a Riviera yacht. Thanks a lot, Diane. This morning, Victoria Beckham also got into the act: Let's just be honest with ourselves – this is all a giant ploy to get Karl Lagerfeld involved in charity Neknominate, right?

"It’s that time of year again. The days are getting shorter, nights are getting colder. Enter Parajumpers, with a new collection that’s a surefire way to make sure you’re looking hot in the colder months. (Sorry, not sorry.) If you aren’t familiar, Parajumpers is the Italy-based brand inspired by the rescue squadron in Anchorage, Alaska of the same name, who brave some of the harshest conditions known to man and who are trained to a higher standard than just about any military corps in the world. It won’t come as a surprise, then, that the brand is known for its outerwear. This season the label’s creative director Massimo Rossetti decided to enlist Japanese artist Yoshinori Ono and the young Hungarian designer Agnes Kemeny to give their take on the brand’s legacy of quality materials, archive pieces, and collaborative design, all while combining them with Japanese tech and athleisure functionality principals. To showcase the new collection, photographer Joyce NG and stylist Peghah Maleknejad took to the canals of Little Venice, pairing the coats and jackets with relaxed denim and vintage-looking sunglasses. Think of Autumn as your time to shine. Even if while posing on a boat in the middle of a London canal. Head to the gallery above for all the images from the shoot.

"“I am still wondering if we are at Saint Martins because we are like this, or we are like this because we are at Saint Martins,” the anonymous style-spy behind the snooper account @thats_so_csm explains. By ‘like this’ they are talking about a certain eccentricity, a special something CSM students have, given it’s a place where “it’s totally fine when you come to class with a pink face.” Scrolling through the grid you’ll find what is commonly referred to as a mood, whether it’s fairy-inspired queers with elf ears or a girl dressed as Kirsten Dunst in Marie Antoinette off to Wednesday morning lectures. “CSM is a special place,” the on-campus spy continues, “and I really want share that with the outside world, and de-mystify the institution. We are certainly the creative leaders of the future, but at the end of the day we are also just confused kids figuring out life.” It’s a sweet sentiment. The school is one of the few safe spaces to cater for those experimenting with wild clothing, both on the pattern cutting table and on their bodies, and the account offers a glimpse at what the world could be like if people weren’t so afraid to go the extra mile, and transgress what might be seen as ‘appropriate clothing’. Normcore? Hell no: @thats_so_csm has no interest in that. “There is no perfect look for me, but I like to keep my pictures simple and candid,” they explain of what makes a perfect subject. “Generally, I’m looking for something eccentric and extra that takes courage and attitude to wear. Also, I like to play around with the idea of us artsy kids. It is as cliché as it is true. My biggest muse will always be Harrie Bradshaw. He is sparkling, he has attitude and CSM was his runway. I am very devastated that he graduated this summer. Miss you, Harry!” Although it might seem like the account is purely taking the piss, its owner says that it’s essentially a love letter to what the students of CSM offer the world. “It’s a celebration of the people. The school is breathing creativity and exhaling it. The people I feature, they remind me every day of the magic that happens in our school. However, the account is also a reflection on our school and its detachedness from the real world. CSM is prestigious and an amazing place for all those crazy creative minds. At the same time, it is a circus bubble – we are used to it, but when you go and show the account to the banker next door, she will be very very confused.” And unlike many accounts it’s not necessarily for personal promotion: “I really try to be as discreet as possible in the sense that I’d rather zoom in 10 times than risk being caught. I feel like a spy sometimes. It’s exciting. And to be honest, I would not end up on my account. I love fashion but I am very lazy with my look: simple colours, simple shapes and always comfortable. As a spy it’s better to keep it discreet.”

"Let’s not sugarcoat this: we're in the midst of a climate emergency. The UK sweltered recently in its hottest day ever, and ‘climate refugees’ worldwide are being displaced while battling severe famines and droughts. All industries are complicit in this crisis, but few more so than fashion. Statistics claiming it's the world's second dirtiest industry have been debunked, but that's hardly the point. From water pollution caused by chemical dyes to the endless cycle of new clothes destined for landfill, the industry needs to change drastically, and soon – as climate scientists estimate we only have 11 years to basically stop the apocalypse. To paraphrase The Devil Wears Prada’s ice queen Miranda Priestly, fashion is everywhere, though; it employs millions, inspires millions more and literally keeps entire economies afloat (Bangladesh's economy is 85% garment workers). Can things really change? According to Extinction Rebellion, we no longer have a choice. “The fashion industry is predicted to grow by 63% by 2030, and currently it emits around 10% of greenhouse gases,” XR representative Sara Arnold explained to Dazed. “Catastrophe is already upon us... we are out of time for incremental change to save us from extinction.” As such, the activists’ belief is that the next London Fashion Week should be used as a declaration of emergency, and that ‘business as usual’ should stop immediately. In fact, the Swedish Fashion Council has already listened – cancelling the upcoming Stockholm Fashion Week to pursue more sustainable options. “To paraphrase The Devil Wears Prada’s ice queen Miranda Priestly, fashion is everywhere; it employs millions, inspires millions more and literally keeps entire economies afloat. Can things really change?” Of course, we can all make beneficial changes to our fashion habits: buy vintage and second-hand, mend clothes, embrace the ethos of less is more. But can the fashion week system really be overhauled? With more and more young, emerging London designers driving a message of sustainability and creating collections in a conscious way, does the answer really lie in cancelling it completely? People will continue to create, trends will continue to be born, and fast fashion retailers like boohoo.com and Pretty Little Thing will likely be just as quick to keep up with them. From the amount of materials and power used (and wasted) when it comes to show production, to the amount of flights needed to transport thousands of editors, buyers, influencers, and models around the world season after season, what cannot be denied is that cancelling fashion week as a whole and looking for an alternative means through which to demonstrate creativity would certainly help to alleviate the massive impact the event has on the planet. But what are could those alternatives be? We reached out to a series of fashion insiders, sustainability experts, and forward-thinking designers to find out. “We have a wealth of clothing already made, so instead of engaging in mindless consumption, we’re asking citizens to reframe how they treat, cherish and value their existing clothes. Learn to make and mend; swap or hire what you need; shop second-hand and vintage. We also need to use our energy to demand systemic change within government. It’s about doing what’s necessary, not what’s achievable within current systems. “The Tate recently held People’s Assemblies for culture workers with the aim of finding a way forward. If the fashion industry convenes, it should agree not to show new clothes. It should use its influence to tell the truth, declare emergency, decide what action looks like and act immediately. We’re asking for a total revision of what ‘fashion’ means; we’re asking consumers to boycott and rebel against a system which is killing us and the natural world. We don’t think this is the end of fashion, though – more an opportunity to creatively transform it into something regenerative for society and nature.” “Sweden’s fashion industry has been a leading force in sustainability, primarily presenting sustainably-minded brands. But by cancelling fashion week, the SFC has laid the foundations of a new platform which highlights sustainable development and innovation, shares expertise and creates an innovation centre to develop new solutions. Creativity and design inspiration are as key to this new platform as sustainable innovation, new business models or textile development, but it steps ahead of the traditional fashion week system. This new format will drive change, and lay out a vision for the future of the fashion industry.” “We continually look at how London can lead the way our industry addresses change, whether through e-commerce and digital communications or helping British businesses prepare for economic and societal challenges. That includes addressing how our industry can adapt to change in the climate emergency. London Fashion Week engages designers, industry and consumers; it gives the UK a strong narrative and a position as a leader in design. It can be a powerful platform to address issues. “This September, we will showcase businesses that exemplify Positive Fashion at our LFW showrooms so they have a platform to show that business can be done differently. I believe LFW as a platform can communicate to both the industry and the general public that not all businesses are equal. Those that support a better future are the ones that should be supported; they should be able to encourage more to adapt better business practices of positive change.” “It’s difficult to suggest an alternative to fashion week, because it’s there to make sure that everyone is in the same place to see the work and the BFC has been hugely supportive to me as a young designer. It’s also important to build relationships with clients, because ultimately I have to sell clothes to be able to give back. Especially because I work with recycled textiles, it’s crucial for people to see them up-close – you can’t do that with a picture. “I’m also part of Fashion Revolution and its Open Studio initiative, which is incredible because it demystifies fashion and gives real insight into the slow processes behind making these clothes. I also don’t think there should be pressure for designers to show every season, but again it really is difficult to suggest a viable fashion week alternative; at the end of the day, I do have to sell garments.” “We have a brilliant fashion week alternative – Fashion Open Studio! It’s a week packed with initiatives celebrating the people and processes behind fashion and accessories collections, which promotes industry transparency through simple, authentic narratives that resonate with consumers and creatives alike. “The aim is to shine a light on emerging talent and established trailblazers who are finding innovative ways of producing fashion which are mindful of people, the planet and its resources. While the rest of the industry is focussed on the end product, we offer an inclusive platform which celebrates the cultural and commercial value of the whole creative process – and which hopes to provoke discussion around how fashion is made.” “We’re asking for a total revision of what ‘fashion’ means; we’re asking consumers to boycott and rebel against a system which is killing us and the natural world. We don’t think this is the end of fashion, though – more an opportunity to creatively transform it into something regenerative for society and nature” – Sara Arnold, Extinction Rebellion “It’s natural to want to eradicate something we’re told is bad for us, and I do believe we should all make responsible daily choices – in a world where natural resources are depleting, we all have to preserve what’s left. But we have to ask: will eradicating fashion week change consumer habits, or stop clothes going to landfill? A total shutdown would impact economies, jobs, and livelihoods, affecting families and devastating other industries, so it’s not about saying ‘cancel fashion week’ – we have to think this through. “What if we approached fashion week differently by putting change-making designers at the forefront rather than slapping in a ‘sustainable’ section? We’ve had support from remarkable organisations, but the BFC hasn’t approached us to create something magical. Maybe the problem is that the industry is ‘closed’; it’s only looking through one lens. Still, something has to change and fashion has to widen its perspective. That’s why we created ONELAB, which empowers special needs children and adults through fashion entrepreneurship – it’s a more holistic approach which acknowledges that fashion has to take time, think and build a strategy that makes sense.” “Fast fashion is a bit like single-use plastic. It’s a conveyor belt taking millions of new clothes through design, production, use and then swiftly into the bin. What’s worse, the belt is now moving faster and the heap of wasted clothes at the end of it is getting ever higher. One rubbish truck of textiles gets landfilled or burned every second. And less than 1% of the material used to produce clothing is recycled into new garments at the end of its life. Ready-to-wear has become ready-to-waste. “This needs to change, and that needs to start at the drawing board where new clothes are designed. We need garments that are easier to mend, reuse and resell. We need to reduce the water, chemicals and fossil fuels that go into making them. We need big fashion brands to stop incinerating millions of perfectly good, unsold clothes. And we need the industry to send a different message: not ‘buy more, use less’, but ‘buy much less, use much more’. When it comes to the planet’s resources, we need to start cutting our coat according to our cloth.”

"After much speculation, last week US Vogue finally revealed its hallowed September issue, covered by none other than Beyoncé. Shot by 23-year-old Tyler Mitchell, the photographer made history by becoming the first black person to shoot the publication’s cover since it was founded 126 years ago. While it was initially rumoured that the singer had complete creative control of the cover and shoot and hand-picked the photographer, this was later dispelled by editor-in-chief Anna Wintour and Mitchell himself. Previously, Vogue cover shoots have been the responsibility of a small, elite circle including Mario Testino and Patrick Demarchelier – before they were dropped from all Condé Nast publications following allegations of sexual misconduct. Vogue obviously isn’t alone in having a small pool of (almost exclusively white) photographers shooting its covers; the problem is industry-wide and systemic. In fact, for an industry that prides itself on newness, many high profile photographers end up working for the same brands and titles for decades – stopping younger names from rising. Last year, Pirelli released its annual calendar, this time featuring an all-black cast of celebrities and models acting out the Alice in Wonderland story. But while it was styled by Edward Enninful, it was shot by a white photographer – Tim Walker, who called it a “celebration of black beauty”. The absence of a black photographer considered high-profile enough to shoot such a prestigious calendar was telling – the same was true of Vogue Italia’s infamous July 2008 issue. While it broke barriers for featuring only black models, the majority of its shoots (including the cover) were shot by white photographer Steven Meisel. In other words, even in historic moments which have centred black people in fashion imagery, the person behind the camera is often a white guy. So why isn’t there a black David Sims or Annie Leibovitz? For many, the first hurdle comes before the idea of pursuing a career in fashion is fully established. While names like Peter Lindbergh or Ellen Von Unwerth are well known, due to the lack of revered black fashion photographers families are understandably concerned about the few opportunities for their children compared to their white peers. “Culturally creating art has historically been a lesser trade than becoming a doctor,” says filmmaker and photographer Rhea Dillon, whose work focuses on breaking stereotypes around black women. “I feel like fewer in our race have taken it up as something they could uphold a family with and make them proud.” While it’s true that for anyone pursuing a career in fashion the struggle is real, it’s almost impossible for those from working-class backgrounds, without parents to support them financially when first starting out. “Generally speaking, black photographers are more likely than white photographers to be from lower-income households,” London-based photographer Ronan McKenzie tells us. “Unpaid work, late payments from clients and lack of cash flow can quickly kick black photographers out of the game, while others may be able to rely on family or friends to help them out.” For many, it’s obviously disappointing – “There have been a lot of frustrating nights and phone calls to my mum and brother about this, and how I want to pack it up and move along to something else,” New York-based photographer Joshua Woods says. “Unpaid work, late payments from clients and lack of cash flow can quickly kick black photographers out of the game, while others may be able to rely on family or friends to help them out” – Ronan McKenzie Social media has slightly changed the game – with upcoming photographers often using Instagram as a platform to get their work noticed – but the growth is far too slow, especially when it comes to longstanding publications and major fashion houses. “They seem unwilling to give big jobs to black photographers, especially upcoming ones,” McKenzie continues. The value of having people in the industry to support and suggest you is a privilege that black photographers don’t have, with photo commissioner, art director, and editor roles scarcely being filled by black creatives. “We need to be 50 times better than other photographers to get noticed in the first place, and then when we reach those meetings we are frequently the only black voice in the room, which can make it difficult to be heard and understood.” If being a black photographer trying to make it wasn’t difficult enough, being an Africa-based one is even more of an uphill battle. Without mainstream publications – as Naomi Campbell keeps asking: ‘Where is Vogue Africa?’ – those looking to break into fashion have to go off their own backs. As Nigeria-based photographer Daniel Obasi explains: “it hinders the visibility of emerging talents.” That, and the fact that there are established white photographers celebrated for their portrayal of the Afro-aesthetic. “Institutions need to actually begin hiring black photographers, instead of just using our images on the moodboard and then commissioning someone else,” says McKenzie. “Hire African photographers, stylists, and creatives – there are a lot of us,” agrees Obasi. There are so many talented black photographers – including Ruth Ossai, Nadine Ijewere, Adama Jalloh, Davey Adesia, Campbell Addy, Renell Medrano, and duo Durimel, in addition to the ones featured in this article. The problem isn’t finding them – “With social media it’s the easiest it’s ever been to find talented people,” says Dillon – but giving them the opportunities that have been handed to a select few for far too long. “It’s quite simple: hire us,” she continues. “Not because we’re black and you need to fill a quota, but because we are skilled at what we do and having a diverse eye behind the lens only makes your brand or publication better.” “Many magazines use the same photographers – it’s no secret,” continues Woods. “A lot of magazines cater to a white audience that exist in middle America so the lens is different.” Thankfully, the landscape of fashion media is changing, with POC determined to consume media that is both for them and by them. Nataal Media has become a platform for burgeoning African creatives (both local and diaspora), helping to launch an annual exhibition with Red Hook Labs in Brooklyn. Campbell Addy’s Niijournal is another excellent example, and just last weekend, WOC-run platform gal-dem took over the Guardian Weekend magazine. Such publications have provided opportunities other well-known titles won’t, and proved in the process that black photographers have the talent it takes. Still, the white gaze remains the default point of view – particularly in fashion. Those commissioning imagery need to examine why POC shouldn't be considered for the jobs usually given to their white peers. ”There should be more collaboration with more black fashion editors, and more people of colour working on sets” – Joshua Woods While huge opportunities like shooting the cover of US Vogue’s September issue are few and far between for black photographers, a feeling of celebration is shared by everyone we spoke to, hoping it’s the beginning of change in the industry. “A lot of things will be done differently after this,” says an optimistic Obasi. “It just goes to show that anything is possible today.” Also hopeful, McKenzie wants to work hard now, not only for herself, but to provide a platform for others in the future. “The lack of black photographers has made me more passionate and driven to support other black creatives and reach a position of power to help others up with me.” An important sentiment, but why should the burden lie solely on the shoulders of black creatives? “There should be more collaboration with more black fashion editors, and more people of colour working on sets,” Woods enthuses. “Agencies have a lot of power too. They just need to start bringing in more black photographers.” Sure, Vogue made the decision to hire Mitchell for this cover, but would it have been the same if it wasn’t Beyoncé? It remains to be seen. The industry seems to be taking a step in the right direction – Mitchell’s cover and the gal-dem takeover are evidence of that – but it’s important for us to not let another 126 years pass before the next first.

"Following the release of the Louis Vuitton Archlight, Kiko Kostadinov and Asics’ collaborative Gel Burz, the Balenciaga Track, and countless other contenders, it may seem that, in the year of our Lord 2018, we’ve hit peak ugly sneaker. Given the trend seems to be going nowhere, though, and as we wait in anticipation for the next absolute unit to drop, the question on our lips is: where do we go from here? Step in Michael Cutini. The Milan-based footwear designer is making a name for himself with his unique sneaker hybrids, which see him splice Air Max with Air Force 1s, Ozweegos and Triple S, and LV with Gucci, Prada, and Chanel to create the ultimate, boss-level kicks. “I started my Instagram a year ago, when I was working for a well-known label but in a totally unproductive position – so I decided to start creating these mash-ups to attract attention from other brands,” explains Cutini. It worked. Soon after, he was approached by Italian label Santoni, where he now works as a junior sneaker designer. And while his designs started out as a concept made using Photoshop, they’ve recently begun manifesting IRL. “I usually get sneakers from friends, or buy them in shops and literally destroy them before I start reworking,” he says of his process. “Luckily I live near a shoemaking district so I can do some of the process in the factory close to my house.” When it comes to where he finds inspiration, Cutini explains that he’s always on the look-out everywhere he goes. “I take inspiration from the streets. I look at the styles people wear and I imagine combining the best aspects of their favourite sneakers. But my favourite ones to re-work are anything from Raf Simons’ project with adidas. The Ozweego and the Detroit Runner are the best crazy ugly sneakers of all time.” Perhaps surprisingly, Cutini’s taste is slightly more minimal than his Instagram would have you believe, though. “I love the Air Max 1, because it’s just so timeless,” he says. “I would love to collaborate with Nike at some point.” Who would he want to see wearing them? “Kanye West, probably. Or my mum.” @michael_cutini

"Fashion blogging is getting more and more lucrative; for big name bloggers, at least. Today's WWD reports that style bloggers like Bryanboy and Aimee Song now earn six-figure salaries. That's a yearly salary of a hundred thousand dollars – and in some cases, even more. Popular bloggers can demand $50,000 for an appearance at a high-profile brand event like a store opening. One top blogger charged $5,000 for posting a single Instagram photo of the brand's product. Other ways that bloggers are making bank include affiliate sales (i.e. when readers click on a product on a blog to purchase it from the brand) and collaborations with fashion labels. Another way of thinking about how much bloggers make? They don't need to rely on freebies any more. As Bryanboy puts it: ""I’ve made enough to live comfortably and be able to not wear samples and buy my clothes retail."" But being paid big money by brands doesn't necessarily lead to any kind of loyalty. In fact, it seems like many bloggers are out for everything they can get. According to the WWD article, it's best to think of them as ""brand stars whose voices are subjective to what they do or don’t like at the moment – often times dependent on which companies will pay them the most. None of the top bloggers interviewed for this article say they adhere to a strict set of journalistic codes or ethics."" So is it time to quit your internship and start a blog? Not quite. When Suzy Menkes wrote her much-discussed New York Times piece on how bloggers had turned fashion into a ""circus"", she pinpointed an increasing fatigue with the world of fashion blogging. New York Fashion Week cut invites by 20 per cent last year, leaving many bloggers out in the cold. As The Cut notes, editors are also becoming increasingly social media-savvy, competing with bloggers for retweets and Instagram likes. Where bloggers once distinguished themselves from industry figures by offering an intimate and personalised view of fashion, some fashion editors and writers are just as likely to tweet backstage posts and #OOTDs. It's worth noting that many of top bloggers interviewed for the WWD article started their blogs when the industry was very different – Bryanboy, for instance, started blogging nine years ago. So if there's anything to learn from this, it's that fashion blogging is only big, big money for a very lucky few.

"Now that December is here (we can’t believe it either) the good news is that the holidays are just around the corner. The bad news though, is that in just 19 days fashion boutique colette will be closing its doors after 20 years. Since the news was announced, there has been little information on what will be next for colette – until now. Yesterday at the Business of Fashion’s VOICES talk, founder Sarah Andelman announced that after the store closes she will be launching a consultancy company called Just An Idea. “Everything has changed so much we thought we could either radically change everything, or turn the page and write a new chapter,” Andelman said at the event. The new creative consultancy will collaborate with brands and support young designers outside of just buying products to be bought in the store. While many will be sad that colette will not be continuing, Andelman will still be able to showcase new talents with her new venture. As for the iconic store space in Paris, it is rumoured that Saint Laurent – who have just launched colette’s final takeover featuring YSL-branded leather paddles that are absolutely not for sex – will be moving in next year.

"Milan fashion week has arrived, today opening with the always extra Gucci. Following last season’s futuristic space-age collection, Alessandro Michele transformed the show’s space into a somehow modern ode to civilisations lost – here are our highlights. Each guest was given a GUCCY-branded keepsake tin containing scented papers, black candles, and matches. The perfect gift for the fashion conscious arsonist in your life. The show was held in the house’s still relatively shiny and new via Mecenate headquarters, in the airplane hangar-sized warehouse showspace that contained a giant pyramid for AW17. Inside, the space was full of statues, from ancient Egypt to Mayan archways and Grecian and Roman goddesses, as well as contemporary streetlights. The world is having some big conversations about the motives and meanings of monuments lately, but this felt like a postmodern spectacle rather than a political statement. As well as A$AP Rocky, the Gucci Bloom girls (Hari Nef, Petra Collins and Dakota Johnson) and the Roman faces of the Resort campaign, Harlem tailor and new face of Gucci tailoring Dapper Dan was there. The bootleg designer was referenced in Gucci’s Resort collection that was presented in Florence and after starring in the campaign announced that with the help of the Italian brand will be opening his studio doors once again. When it comes to Gucci are under the direction of Alessandro Michele, more is always more. And the SS18 collection was no less impressive when it come to the volume of pieces on display: there were sci-fi sunglasses, diamanté ‘Gucci’ hair barrettes, GG medallion necklaces, bumbags and 80s power shoulders – all in the first half of the show. Elsewhere there were giant totes, mink-lined coats and fashion’s first designer neck brace. Spinal-aligning chic. As the lights went down and the models speed walked out onto the runway, bathed in disco flashing coloured lights, you might have done a few double takes due to the iconic logos and motifs reworked to fit the Gucci-sphere. There was a red-collared t-shirt made to look like a pack of Marlboro reds, a white satin Evel Knievel jumpsuit and more obvious references like the giant rhinestoned Bugs Bunny head on the front of a jumper. Others were more instructional and read “Never Marry a Mitford” – inspired by the 11th Duke of Devonshire, who did, in fact, marry one. Elton John also made a surprising appearance (sadly not IRL) on a tote bag that was illustrated with the single cover for his 1971 “Levon”. Last season there was the chainmail bodysuit – made even more famous when RiRi wore it – and today there were the totally crazy sequinned dress/cape/mask/bow/jacket contraptions. Almost a real-life version of the IG filter that makes everything glitter, it seemed as if almost every outfit of the 107 look strong collection had some sort of sequin or rhinestone. Could it be an homage to the King of all that glitters, Bob Mackie? The rhinestoned bodysuits certainly looked like it. It seemed that “resistance” was on Alessandro Michele’s mind this season – or at least that is what his show notes said. As for the clothes, they declared words like ‘animal magnetism’ and ‘spiritiso’. Backstage he summed it up more simply: “It’s about the things that are not believable,” he said.

"Initial reaction: A neatness unraveled. References: Knotted belts referenced karate uniforms or dressing gowns, with a distinct Japanese undertone. Deconstructivism reigned in partially detached panels and raw hems. Stand out looks: A sky blue and white dress, which appeared to be built from vast folds of fabric, loosely tacked and tied with a belt. Unexpected details: Peeps of dotted orange after a pure white opening, and the wispy threads hanging from sleeves, collars and skirt hems. Colour impressions: The brightest vermillion, sky blue and mint green, against a more sombre palette of white, taupe and midnight blue. Viral moment: The cropped green sweater and low-slung sky blue trousers combo that popped up between tunics. Pleasantly unexpected. Accessories: Black flip flops with refined trouser suits and tunics – a sight in the office next season? Left us wanting: To steal our little brother’s karate belt and tie it over everything. Beauty: Matte burgundy lips and darkened full eyebrows. Most likely to: Cement Ter et Bantine’s place at PFW: this was their first show in Paris since moving from Milan.

"After a year’s development, Nike has revealed a hijab collection designed for female Muslim athletes: a step towards making sport more inclusive. The design was developed with help from weightlifter Amna Al Haddad and figure skater Zahra Lari, both from the United Arab Emirate. “Can’t believe this is finally here!!” Lari, an upcoming Winter Olympics hopeful, wrote in an IG post which showed her wearing a piece of the collection. Nike’s pull-on hijab is made of a light polyester material, with small holes to improve breathability and a longer back to ensure it doesn’t come untucked while exercising or performing. It will also come in black, grey and obsidian, and be available to buy in 2018. “The Nike Pro Hijab has been a year in the making, but its impetus can be traced much further back to Nike’s founding mission, to serve athletes, with the signature addendum: If you have a body, you’re an athlete,” the sportswear brand said in a statement. “This movement first permeated international consciousness in 2012, when a hijabi runner took the global stage in London.” Nike references the London Olympics runner, Saudi Arabia's Sarah Attar. Bronze medal-winning fencer Ibtihaj Muhammad from New York was the first Muslim American woman to compete for the U.S wearing a hijab at the Olympics. Bahraini sprinter Ruqaya al-Ghasra wore a hijab in the 2004 Olympics in Athens and in Beijing’s 2008 competition. Many on social media have welcome the move by the brand, where others have been critical, stating that there are many smaller brands out there that have broken this ground long before.

"Sex sells – or at least, that’s the thinking that Eckhaus Latta wanted to tackle head-on in its first ad campaign featuring its SS17 collection. A full-frontal, frank look at real sex, complete with real friends and Craigslist-cast people involved (yes, really) – the images are an unconventional but totally on-brand take on the glut of sex imagery in fashion. For the project, Mike Eckhaus and Zoe Latta teamed up with friend and photographer Heji Shin. The pair decided that they were “amused by the relationship between fashion advertising and sexuality (and) more interested in producing images that are open to interpretation.” “We live in a time where there is still tension between individualised freedom of expression (especially online) and puritanical approaches to sex that are deeply encoded in culture,” the two say. This then, was a reaction to that – a defiant celebration of the fact that, “real sex, after all, is beautiful,” and just something that is an “acceptable – and integral – part of being a human being.” Despite having previously debuted a poster with artist Bjarne Melgaard depicting a model sniffing poppers, Eckhaus and Latta are keen to stress that provocation isn’t actually the main goal here. “We’re more interested in being open to, and acknowledging a fuller range of human experiences,” they say. Though still censored, these naturalistic shots of couples connecting intimately are a matter-of-fact antidote to the usually heavily stylised use of sex to sell clothes in this industry. Controversial only really through our perception of the subject matter, the visuals are a fitting representation to the label that has been leading the New York underground design scene for years now. If you have a problem – it’s not them, it’s you.

"Though it’s only in its third year, the LVMH prize (and its €300,000 cash award) has already acted as a catalyst for the careers of previous winners Thomas Tait and Marques’Almeida. Now, the list of 23 nominees has been whittled down to just eight finalists, who will be judged by an elite jury that includes J.W. Anderson, Riccardo Tisci and Marc Jacobs. Among this year’s finalists are Dazed 100 stars Grace Wales Bonner and Vejas, both celebrated for their unconventional yet groundbreaking work. Along with her elegant and exquisite menswear, Wales Bonner is praised for how she delicately and poetically explores the portrays of black masculinity in her work. Vejas Kruszewski on the other hand, is acclaimed for his futuristic, genderless designs, as well as his complex cuts, thought-provoking presentations and diverse cast of models. The global nature of contemporary fashion is represented by the selection of Finnish brand Aalto International and Tokyo’s Facetasm, as well as French fashion house Koche and Y/Project, the label headed up by Belgian designer Glenn Martens. One other recognisable name on the final list is Brandon Maxwell, Lady Gaga’s current stylist and the designer behind her tux-gown hybrid that stole the show at this year’s Oscars. L.A. label Alyx rounds off the overall line-up; the brainchild of renowned creative director Matthew Williams, recently spotlighted by Dazed. Vote for Grace Wales Bonner in the Dazed 100 here and for Vejas here.

"Rick Owens has always been an outsider. Since his inauguration as the high priest of avant-garde fashion back in the early 90s, the designer has stuck a firm two fingers up at the notion of trends, and surrounded himself with a like-minded band of non-conformists – from the likes of Tommy Cash and Christeene, to Fecal Matter and Gareth Pugh. Having seen The Rocky Horror Picture Show as a teenager, in 2016 Owens explained to Dazed he’d “physically ached to be part of that group of cheerfully degenerate weirdos,” and seemingly did everything within his power to make that happen. When it came to his AW19 show, Owens took the opportunity to spotlight another, slightly lesser-known outsider: Larry Legaspi. If you’re unfamiliar with the name, it’s not surprising. Despite the fact the New York-based designer pioneered the space-y, sleazy, glam-rock look of the 1970s, and dressed the likes of Kiss, Divine, Grace Jones, and trailblazing girl-group Labelle, Google searches for ‘Legaspi’ came up with little more than nothing. A Wikipedia page? Until late last week, there was no sign of one of those either. Owens, a long-time fan of his work who’s been citing him as an influence for almost two decades, is set to rectify this come October, though – given he just announced he’s been working on a new book dedicated to Legaspi’s life, work, and legacy. “He introduced a camp ferocity to the mainstream and helped set a lot of kids like me free, with his art deco sexual ambiguity and raw, black leather bombast,” he explained after his Paris show. Of course, he couldn’t do it alone: which, since Larry himself passed away in 2001, is where his widow Val Legaspi comes in. “Larry was such an amazing man and had an incredible amount of talent, but he was always overlooked in favour of designers like Thierry Mugler and what was going on on the Paris runway” – Val Legaspi “I got a phone call from Rick, who I didn’t really know that much about,” she explains. “He told me he’d always been inspired by Larry and that he’d been thinking of writing a book about him, and he asked me if I’d be happy for him to do so. Immediately, I said yes! Larry was such an amazing man and had an incredible amount of talent, but he was always overlooked in favour of designers like Thierry Mugler and what was going on on the Paris runway – so of course I wanted him to finally get the recognition he’s always deserved. Next thing I knew, Rick and Michele (Lamy) had arranged to come to New York, and Rick was elbow deep in a box of press cuttings and sketches in my closet!” Having “fallen immediately in love” with Rick and Michele, following the meeting, Val teamed up with friends Sandra and Theresa to properly archive all of the materials she’s kept in boxes for the past two decades. “I don’t have a computer, so Sandra and Theresa are taking care of the scanning and the Instagram account and all of that,” she says. “There’s so much to get through.” As his story comes together in the hands of Val and “her girls” (as she affectionately refers to them) and we await the release of Owens’ book later this year, here we take a look at the extraordinary – and largely unknown – designer’s life. Larry Legaspi was born in 1950 in New Jersey, but made the move to New York City “as fast as he could, straight out of school,” explains Val. “He was a shy introverted kid, who was bullied throughout his childhood, so making a break for the city was something he wanted to do for a long time growing up.” Having enrolled at FIT and bought his first sewing machine from the Salvation Army, Legaspi sold his first clothing collection – Mother Superior Clothing – at legendary Soho boutique Abracadabra in 1971, before opening his own store the following year. Situated in the West Village, Moonstone was founded alongside jeweller Richard Erker and graphic designer Rob Cornucio, and mainly dealt with private clients. “At that time, Larry’s designs were so far-out they drew a fairly specific crowd that knew exactly what they were looking for.” “Larry was great friends with Divine, John Waters, and that whole Baltimore set,” explains Val. “Divine would always be at the Legaspi salon which opened off Madison Avenue in 1977. He owned an apartment just around the corner – a penthouse in fact – and Larry and I ended up living in it while he was away, which was pretty lucky because renting a studio on Madison was so expensive, and Larry was totally independent.” As well as dressing Divine, Legaspi also created the iconic looks worn by Kiss – with their gender-blurring, avant-garde catsuits and cut-out quilted leather looks coming to define the glam rock super-group’s aesthetic. George Clinton of Funkadelic, Grace Jones, and Pat Cleveland would often come to Larry when they needed something particularly showstopping, too – but it was Legaspi’s costumes for pioneering girl group Labelle that are perhaps the most significant among his vast archive. “Patti (Labelle) told me she didn’t think, as a group of soul singers, that they would have been invited to play the Metropolitan Opera House had they not worked with Larry,” says Val. “Larry was great friends with Divine, John Waters, and that whole Baltimore set. Divine would always be at the studio having wild costumes made, and then later at the Legaspi salon which opened off Madison Avenue in 1977” – Val Legaspi Legaspi and Val met when she was working in PR in 1977: “We got on like a house on fire, and eventually I began working with him,” she remembers. “We’d go out to dinner, to these big parties, and then we’d come back and work late into the night or the early hours of the morning – that was our life together.” The pair’s first public outing came in 1979, when they attended the Met Ball, with Val wearing a dramatic red fishtail gown, as designed by Legaspi. “It was a totally crazy night. Larry usually dressed these tall, long-legged supermodels like Grace and Pat, and here I was, this platinum-haired, five-foot-something, full-figured woman in this beautiful gown he’d made for me.” Val also remembers a particularly avant-garde gown – the Queen of the Night dress – she wore to an opera performance in aid of peace in the Middle East at the New York State Theatre in 1980. “It was enormous,” laughs Val. “It was this huge black dress that had a 40-pound battery pack I had to carry underneath it to power its lights and all these mechanical bats that were all over it. We called it the Bat Gown, unofficially. Larry was always so ahead of his time, always finding inspiration in nature, and sci-fi, and old movies. His knowledge was unbelievable.” Though he was enrolled at FIT for a few semesters, for the most part Legaspi was self-taught and naturally highly skilled. When making the costumes the likes of Kiss and Labelle wore, the designer employed a unique method called ‘trapunto’, which saw him painstakingly pull individual lengths of cord through fabric. Resulting in a quilted effect, this meant the sculptural elements of the looks – the shoulder pads and collars for example – stood up entirely on their own without support. But Legaspi wasn’t just about over-the-top futurism and space age fantasies: his boutique also stocked a line of basics, including satin suits, simple sweaters, and single-seamed leather pants, as well as draped spandex and jersey dresses. “It wasn’t just about the drama for Larry,” explains Val. “He also wanted to create simple, beautiful pieces for women who weren’t of supermodel proportions.” “Larry and I got on like a house on fire, and eventually I began working with him. We’d go out to dinner, to these big parties, and then we’d come back and work late into the night or the early hours of the morning – that was our life together” – Val Legaspi Legaspi had been openly gay throughout his life when he and Val embarked on a romantic relationship in the late 70s. “It actually blew me away when I first met Rick, because there are so many parallels between his life with Michele and my life with Larry,” she recalls. “Larry was gay, and, of course, Rick is openly bisexual, but there were a lot of other crossovers, too. They never met despite being in LA at the same time, for example, but they knew a lot of the same people. Bill Cunningham was one of our dear friends, and it was around the time Bill passed that Rick first got in touch with me – I had no idea they knew each other until I saw an Instagram post of the two of them together. It kind of felt like some weird, cosmic moment, like Bill had overseen Rick finding me or something.” Both Cunningham and fellow photographer Roxanne Lowit were constants in the Legaspi’s lives, documenting their 1982 wedding for Details magazine with an article entitled Wedding Belle. Legaspi oversaw the spectacular ceremony, creating looks not just for himself and his bride, but also a huge number of the attendees, too. In 1984, the Legaspis left the city and moved out to Glen Cove in New York State – into a house Larry himself found after he acquired his real estate license. The couple embraced a quieter life away from the chaos of Manhattan, visiting Val’s parents on the weekends and taking walks. In the years following, Larry and Val separated, with Larry moving to Arizona briefly, before spending most of the 90s in Palm Springs and Los Angeles. In April 2001, not long after he relocated to North Carolina, Larry died aged 51, as the result of complications relating to AIDS. Though his name is unknown to many, and his vast body of work is only just starting to be archived, documented, and chronicled properly – by Val, her friends, and Rick Owens himself – it seems the revolutionary designer is finally about to get the recognition he deserves. “It’s amazing that a new generation are going to be inspired by Larry’s designs, and that’s largely down to Rick,” says Val. “I know he would be absolutely thrilled that his work is finally out there for the whole world to see.”

"Designer Virgil Abloh was in London last weekend, but not to show a new Off-White collection. Instead, he set up Off Campus, a series of talks and events publicising the launch of his new collaboration with Nike. Entitled ‘The Ten’, the collection features – you guessed it – ten of the brand’s iconic styles of trainer with an Abloh twist: the Blazer, the Air Jordan 1 and Converse’s Chuck Taylor each come cable tied and clearly labelled (like a fashion-forward anatomy chart) with “FOAM”, “AIR” and “SHOELACES.” “Everyone has a memory associated with all these shoes,” Abloh said, “They've followed our transition from the music scene when Kurt Cobain started wearing Chuck Taylors and infused energy into the shoe. With Air Max I think rave shoes, Jordan makes you think of the history of Air Force Ones and New York City.” Various workshops were open and free for those who managed to secure a place by registering online, including the opportunity to customise your own Air Force 1s with the help of mentors including Grace Wales Bonner and Michele Lamy. There was also an education in t-shirt making with Martine Rose and an ‘Agit-zine’ experience with graphic designer Neville Brody. We dropped by The Barbican’s cinema last Friday, where Abloh was joined by Louis Vuitton’s men’s artistic director Kim Jones and an audience of streetwear fans. Interviewed by SHOWStudio editor-at-large, Lou Stoppard, the pair had an hour to share their plans for streetwear world domination and explore the iconic style history of the Air Jordan 1. Here are the main takeaways. Abloh first met Jones backstage at an event in 2007 with mutual friend Kanye West, and the Off-White founder had a pretty big compliment for him. “The designer that I always wanted in the modern industry is Kim Jones, he is the epitome of high fashion and streetwear,” Abloh said, referring to the way Jones has authentically worked across both worlds. He also discussed a time he spent being mentored by him, saying, “I slept on his couch in a front room in Maida Vale and forced him to teach me stuff, I spent a summer sitting there with him. Before the terms streetwear or luxury existed, he was bringing forth street culture ideas through the high fashion system.” Although Jones has been at the helm of Louis Vuitton’s menswear for six years, streetwear has been in his blood since he studied at Central Saint Martins. “For me, whenever I’ve done stuff it's always been half and half, never one thing. A logo is a logo, like with the Nike swoosh it’s the same as the Louis Vuitton monogram. When I was at college I loved Helmut Lang and Alexander McQueen but I also loved Supreme and Bathing Ape.” It became clear that Jones’ obsession with street culture runs deeper than just inspiration when he claimed, “People talk about streetwear but where else would you wear clothes. What I like about it is it’s very authentic, it comes from a genuine place.” Streetwear is often looked down upon from the lofty heights of ready-to-wear, but Abloh and Jones are both renowned for introducing it into the high fashion sphere with catwalks shows in Paris. “My motivation is angst, and feeling that I don’t belong or more to the fact that our generation doesn't belong. We’re coming off the era where high fashion brands are inspired by us and we’re just consuming what is registered back to us,” Abloh explained. “I made a conscious decision that I would not just be a consumer; I wanted to trailblaze and have at least one of us at the end of a Parisian runway.” For many designers, founding a brand with such a powerful trajectory would be more than enough, but not for Abloh. “My goal is that off of activations like this talk, there are ten more Kim Jones...hopefully soon there will be more people in the industry that come from our school of thought.” Abloh’s own success with Off-White isn’t enough – he wants streetwear to be better respected too. “Streetwear is about a whole generation of people who didn't go to fashion school or come from traditional means. The easy way to write it off is to say that it’s not fashion, it’s high street but there are seminal moments in this way of making clothes. You can’t tell me that Supreme isn't my Louis Vuitton. Growing up with Stüssy and teenagers with skateboards, those are the brands that are important to me. I just want to make sure that the door is open for these kids to feel like they can design fashion too.” “I just want to make sure that the door is open for these kids to feel like they can design fashion too” – Virgil Abloh Jones also worked at a streetwear distributor in his youth, something that no doubt inspired the game-changing AW17 Supreme collab. “For me I was very lucky because I got access to a lot of things other people couldn’t, I had Lee McQueen mentor me and Gimme Five introducing me to Nico, Hiroshi, Jun Takahashi and all these people that I really admire and respect. So you fuse all that together and you can create your own thing as well.” This didn’t distract Jones from staying grounded and remembering who he wanted to design for: “It’s just about thinking what your friends want to wear.” In a world steeped in plagiarism, where designers are ripped off left right and centre without even so much as a nod, Abloh’s goal is to design informatively and teach a younger generation about what came before – hence partnerships with legends like Peter Saville. “Pretty much every collection is about me getting on the internet and cold calling everyone from the previous era and getting them to come back and use Off-White as an education device to bridge the gap. That’s always been how I thought we could take on this figurative fashion thing and actually support a community.” Abloh went on to talk about how figures like Hiroshi Fujiwara, Nigo and A-Ron Bondaroff inspire him. “There are so many stories that pre-date now. There’s like 35 brands that failed off the back of Off-White being able to get to where it is, so I have to respect somebody pioneering making t-shirts before, at a time that there wasn't an opportunity for a line to sell out.”

"If you meet a dashing, articulate, well connected fashion photographer in his 50s who shoots for leading publications and turns up backstage at Alexander Wang or Hood By Air shows, you’d perhaps assume that he’s doing just fine. But not everything is always what it seems. Meet Mark Reay and the new documentary about his life – Homme Less. Reay, a regular Dazed contributor, is a mainstay on New York’s fashion scene, walking the streets of Manhattan ""looking like a millionaire, wearing designer suits and expensive leather shoes"". Despite his glamorous work, Reay also spent five years sleeping rough on a rooftop in the East Village, preparing for shoots in public toilets and keeping up appearances throughout a sustained period of homelessness. The filmmakers say: ""HOMME LESS captures a raw and unfiltered moment in time, our time, and raises the question of how far are we from losing everything, even our homes? How often do we have to pretend that everything is fine in order to keep up the facade of being a well-off member of society? And how far do we go to take the financial pressure off our shoulders to live a more carefree life, a life we aspire to live?"" The film comes out on August 7, watch the trailer below and see him flick through a copy of Dazed!

"You might think that fashion, of all industries, would be the most accepting when it comes to the LGBTQ+ community, but that isn’t completely accurate. As recently as 2015, gay models John Tuite and Carlos Santolalla revealed that they were discouraged from being open about their sexuality by model agencies. They aren’t alone, with countless others revealing similar struggles. To combat this, casting director Cody Chandler (who cut his teeth working for agent Barbara Pfister) created New Pandemics – a New York-based casting and management agency solely for LGBTQ+ faces, with his main aim to become a go-to for brands which want to be genuinely diverse. As well as featuring those with a range of different genders and sexualities, the current board is diverse in terms of ethnicities and body types too. More so than a traditional agency, Chandler wants to encourage the individuals he’s representing to pursue their outside interests. “There’s no modelling for the sake of modelling,” he says. “The talent really differs and a lot of them have a strong sense of purpose.” “There’s no modelling for the sake of modelling. The talent really differs and a lot of them have a strong sense of purpose” – Cody Chandler “I like approachable, interesting characters, I always have,” he tells us. “I don’t like typical definitions of beauty. I’ve never been really aligned with mainstream attractiveness.” The same approach applies for New Pandemics. Not only a platform for LGBTQ+ talents, the agency is set apart from others as 10 per cent of its profits will go back into the LGBTQ+ community. The first recipient is the Ali Forney Center, but the plan is to expand to other charities as it grows. “I want to support people within the agency, but I also want to support the community as a whole,” explains Chandler. To celebrate the agency’s opening, Chandler enlisted photographer Richard Kern to shoot the first faces he’s representing. “Richard seemed like the best fit for me, I’ve known him a long time,” he says. “I like the provocative tone of his work and I think that this agency is definitely a provocation to knock things left of centre, to force ideologies to shift in a good way. Here, we catch up with Chandler on what you can expect from New Pandemics. How did you first get into casting? Cody Chandler: Barbara Pfister took me in originally and I worked with her on several campaigns over the years. She’s known for work with David Sims, Steven Klein, Steven Meisel, and early 2000s iconic stuff like The Face. Barbara gave me an opportunity, and I enjoyed working with her. What were some of the skills you learnt from her? Cody Chandler: Barbara is the master of street casting. She’s got this heat-seeking, intuitive quality about her on the street and she finds really interesting faces. She doesn’t have that fear and those barriers of going up to people so I really took that from the experience and it rubbed off for sure. That’s actually helped me form New Pandemics because it took that fearlessness to actually approach people and go into certain environments and reach out to new faces. What was the starting point that made you want to create New Pandemics? Cody Chandler: It was a sequence of events. Within casting, there were brands that didn’t necessarily know how to navigate the landscape of non-binary, transgender, and LGBTQ+ talent in general. A transgender model wrote an email and was pretty much in tears over having to endure being addressed by the wrong pronouns all day. That really bothered me and I didn’t speak up at the time, but now I can see that it was something that I took note of and saw that this (agency) was something that was really lacking and that needed to happen. “We feel that the fashion industry is progressive and we feel like we’re insulated and protected but there’s still a lot of work to be done” – Cody Chandler What is your main goal for the agency? Cody Chandler: New Pandemics is a casting and management agency that works at increasing LGBTQ+ visibility. That sums it up in a sentence. It really is about visibility and advertising is so powerful to help with that. I feel like visibility is an antidote to otherness and it’s so important that people are exposed to people that are different to them, or similar to them as well. To feel like they have a community and that they belong. I really want to support the individuals within the agency. They’re using modelling as their own platform. Modelling isn’t always sustainable and I want them to use their minds and their voices and to take it to support their own personal endeavours and their own personal projects. Do you feel like models are often not able to be open about their sexuality? Cody Chandler: I know several models with mainstream agencies that can’t be vocal about their identities or sexuality at all; this is another reason that I wanted to start New Pandemics. We feel that the fashion industry is progressive and we feel like we’re insulated and protected but there’s still a lot of work to be done. It’s something that really is an issue with agents in general. They’re putting the idea of mass appeal in front of the person’s feeling and treating somebody in a respectful way. It’s putting profits over the person. Do you think it is the same for brands too? Cody Chandler: I think that there’s a sincere push for brands to be inclusive and I think they want to be inclusive but I don’t think they know how to go about it in the right way and the most respectful way. Providing a place for them to educate themselves and to actually pull talent that is informed and active in their communities, that was something that was important to me. Have you noticed attitudes in the casting industry around diversity changing over the years? Cody Chandler: It’s really shifting. I don’t think it’s narcissistic, but I think that people want to see representations of themselves in advertising. It’s becoming more democratised and a little more authentic. We have so much artificiality within news and in imagery and there’s a backlash against it. I think it’s because you have companies that are doing less retouching – you have even American Eagle, that’s very mainstream obviously, but is now doing these stripped back campaigns. So it’s trickling its way, not only from high fashion, with brands like Eckhaus Latta and other more approachable brands, but it’s going all the way down to the mainstream. To me, I find it really important and something that is very necessary and needed to happen. Why was it important for you to contribute some of the agency’s profits to LGBTQ+ charities? Cody Chandler: We shouldn’t be in a day and age where there are statistics that say that 40 per cent of homeless youths identify as LGBTQ+. A lot of these situations came to be because individuals didn’t fit into their communities and their families and had no place to go. There are people within the agency that have actually had that experience. It’s 2018. We can’t have that kind of circumstance, where being honest and truthful with yourself and with other people grants you getting your basic survival needs getting taken away from you at such a young age. It really makes me emotional discussing it because it’s something that I could have or any other individual from a conservative background could have experienced but I was lucky enough not to. “Visibility is an antidote to otherness and it’s so important that people are exposed to people that are different to them, or similar to them as well. To feel like they have a community and that they belong” – Cody Chandler What message are you trying to send to brands, as the go-to for LGBTQ+ talent? Cody Chandler: There’s no excuses anymore, that’s the thing. I don’t want to let brands have an excuse anymore because I’m giving it, I’m providing the space. What are your plans for the future growth of New Pandemics? Cody Chandler: There is roughly 15 talent that are signed right now. It’s more focussed on LGBTQ+ youth at the moment, but what I do plan on doing is to provide the board of directors, who will act as mentors to the people within the agency, to help them with their own endeavours and their own pursuits. For the agency, it will definitely expand in terms of the number of people that I’ll be representing. It’s already diverse but I hope to diversify even more to people across the spectrum. It’s something that’s really important to me and to keep it balanced and to make sure it’s representative of the LGBTQ+ community. That’s something that I’m really working hard on. My major concern is not to paint a picture of doom and gloom. It’s a positive project, but a resolve of negative experiences and hopefully that can come through. It’s not an ‘us against them’ agency at all. @newpandemics

"Alessandro Michele has never played by the rules when it comes to his Gucci campaigns. Whether it’s recreating Noah’s Ark, returning to the peak of Prêt-À-Porter era of fashion or casting cute pigs to live like the Manhattan bourgeoisie, the Italian designer always seems to find a way to create a world you want to jump into. Now, for the label’s Cruise 2020 campaign, Michele has opted to throw the house party of everyone’s dreams – and apparently we’re all invited (figuratively, obvs). Entitled ComeAsYouAre_RSVP, the new series was shot at Villa La Furibonda by Spring Breakers director Harmony Korine and creative directed by Michele himself. Inside the house where the party is set, there’s a jacuzzi, a pool, a bunch of sausage dogs and their fabulous owners, a massage table, as well as guests Iggy Pop, Gucci Mane, and Sienna Miller, who all arriving by limousine. Essentially, it’s the party to end all parties. Also making the guestlist are the likes of actress and model Benedetta Barzini, Countess Marisela Federici, and Italian artists Orlando Miani and Angelo Bucarelli. According to Michele, together they all embody the archetypes of the ‘wild rockstar, the glamorous socialite, the bourgeois lady, the tycoon, and the hip hop star’. The eclectic host of people, from all different walks of life, is representative of Gucci’s aim to break barriers and promote inclusivity. Everyone is invited, regardless of where they are from or who they are. The campaign also mirrors one’s state of mind, with the unbounded aspect of the party symbolising the fact that anything is possible. The 2020 Cruise collection itself was first presented in a museum in Michele’s hometown of Rome four months ago, and was heavily inspired by ancient Rome. The 70s were also a source of inspiration for the collection, with retro floral prints, knitwear in earthy tones, and huge sunglasses appearing throughout. A piece from the Disney x Gucci partnership, which debuted earlier this year to celebrate 90 years of Mickey Mouse, is also featured in the campaign. Elsewhere, the collection also embodies Michele’s sociopolitical standpoint, in regards to freedom of speech and choice, with the slogan ‘my body, my choice’ printed on jackets. Check out the campaign in the gallery above and watch the full film below.

"It’s been almost two months since Lady Gaga shut down the red carpet at this year’s Met Ball, in not one, not two, not even three, but four OTT, uber-camp looks (surpassed only by Billy Porter, who was draped in gold and jewels and carried in on the shoulders of six buff, oiled-up Adonises) – and tbh we’re still recovering. Now, with her Vegas residency having drawn to a close, the iconic singer has been in New York, playing a small, intimate gig at the legendary Apollo Theatre in Harlem last night, where – surprise! – she turned a serious look just before hitting the stage. Wearing a high-waisted leather skirt with chunky silver belt, a matching bandeau, and fetish-y, full-length gloves, the outfit was the work of 2019 Dazed 100-er Akà Prodiàshvili. Known for his avant-garde collections, the Tbilisi-based designer draws inspiration from drag queens including Violet Chachki and Sasha Velour, club kids past and present, and the Georgian LGBTQ+ scene. Using his work as a medium with which to fight back against the country’s archaic attitudes towards the queer community of Georgia and the rampant homophobia felt on its streets, previous champions of his work include Arca, who enlisted the him to create a series of looks for her 2018 tour. Whether intentional or not, Gaga’s championing of a young, queer, Georgian designer comes at a significant moment. Following a week of intense protests and unrest across the country, as tensions between Georgia and neighbouring Russia rise, Tbilisi’s Pride march, which was supposed to take place on Sunday, June 24, was postponed. The first event of its kind since 2013, when attendees were violently attacked by anti-gay protesters, the move comes as a blow to those trying to push things forward when it comes to LGBTQ+ rights across the country. We’re hoping to see the march rescheduled soon, and sending our support to the country’s queer kids fighting for change.

"It may feel like it was just yesterday that the AW19 season was underway, but as quickly as fashion month left us is as fast as it returned. Last week, the SS20 London Fashion Week Men’s shows took place and, to make sure you did not miss anything, we sent photographers both backstage and out on the streets (you’re welcome!). This time around, Yu Fujiwara captured everyone’s best attempts to disguise themselves – as shown in the image of a man in a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle style bandana and another wearing a video game-esque pixelated headpiece. As is the case during every season, creative looks were out in full force during this fashion week. One person decided it was time to elevate denim on denim, completing their look with patchwork denim Nike trainers. The standout look, however, has to be from an individual spotted wearing a full look complete with horns and one lobster claw, because... well, why not? Elsewhere, model Maxim Magnus gave the camera her best subtle smize, pictured with boyfriend, spring 2019 issue cover star and Dazed 100 model Finn Buchanan. As he usually does, Fujiwara photographed the mood that just about everyone feels at the end of the event. Last season, it was a destroyed Burberry bag, reflecting the post-fashion week burnout, while this season it was how most of us feel about adulting – courtesy of an image of the back of a jacket which reads ‘Post no bills’.

"In April of this year, Italian-Belgian designer Anthony Vaccarello was appointed creative director of prestigious fashion house, Saint Laurent. Having previously working at Fendi and Versus Versace, Vaccarello follows in the footsteps of Hedi Slimane, who radically changed the face of the brand during his four-year tenure. Today, the house debuts its first campaign and short teaser film under Vaccarello’s creative direction, giving us a glimpse of what’s to come. Known for his modern aesthetic, the designer’s past work at Versus consisted predominantly of dark colour palettes, body-conscious silhouettes and an indie rock sensibility. Taken by Collier Schorr (the photographer who shot Zayn Malik for the Summer 2016 issue of Dazed), the campaign features several models (and very little clothes) and suggests that Vaccarello might be taking the brand in a more minimal direction to that of his predecessor. As for his debut show, the designer is set to present his first (SS17 womenswear) collection during Paris Fashion Week in October – with additional imagery planned to debut on the brand’s website and Instagram account on June 20th.

"Here's a cautionary tale for any fashion blogger considering underhand means of acquiring their favourite label. David Tripp, who runs a fashion and lifestyle blog called The General Aesthete, has been arrested for identity theft and grand larceny after using stolen credit cards to buy thousands of dollars worth of designer clothing. How did he do it? By pretending to be Johnny Depp's stylist. The New York Times reports that the 31-year-old blogger introduced himself as Depp's stylist at Jil Sander, Carven and Marni Edition stores in Manhattan, claiming to be filling a big order for his A-list boss. His biggest heist was at Jil Sander, where he allegedly walked away with $5,841.14 worth of goods on a stranger's American Express card. Tripp was only busted when he called up a Marc Jacobs store to put in an order for Brandon Flowers (guess being Depp's stylist got old after a while). The store manager noticed that the feminine name on the so-called stylist's credit card (Kelli) didn't exactly match the man's voice on the other end of the line. After quickly googling the card owner's name, the manager realised that Tripp wasn't who he claimed to be. When the blogger arrived to collect the clothes, he was promptly arrested by police officers. Tripp has been charged with identity theft and grand larceny, and was released on bail. He declined to speak about his charges, but said in an email: ""I can say that the narrative in which I’ve been placed is unequivocally inaccurate and unjust.""

"Since Raf Simons took over at Calvin Klein earlier this year, he has been obsessed with the idea of Americana. Not just white picket fences though, his vision has had a darker and more twisted approach. For the recent SS18 collection, that manifested in the form of a Sterling Ruby-designed set with axes hanging from the ceiling, a footwear reference to Friday the 13th and a collaboration with the Andy Warhol Foundation. Today, the American brand has announced that it will be continuing the collaboration with the iconic artist’s Foundation until 2020. While Simons first referenced Warhol back in his debut campaign – which also featured the work of Richard Prince and Ruby – the most recent outing saw archive prints like “Knives”, “The Ambulance Disaster” and “The Electric Chair” printed on shirts, bags and dresses. While you might think of the artist’s famous Campbell’s soup or Marilyn Monroe works at first, the Belgian designer chose to spotlight some of Warhol’s darker pieces instead. Following the show, creative director Pieter Mulier teased on Instagram that there would be more to come with a picture of a Warhol print tee. “He captured all sides of the American experience, including sometimes its darker sides,” said Simons on the artist’s work. “Warhol’s art tells more truths about his country than you can find almost anywhere else.” While the Foundation has previously collaborated with Comme des Garçons and Dior, the new partnership is the biggest yet and will see Simons debut previously unseen works – just another reason to look forward to the AW18 collection next February.

"Alyx founder Matthew Williams has amassed a legion of fans and collaborators since he started the label in the early 00s, with the likes of Lady Gaga, Kanye West, and Virgil Abloh among them. Recently he presented his first catwalk show in Paris, collaborated with Nike on a utilitarian, streetwear-inspired collection, and joined forces with Kim Jones to create the hardware featured in his debut Dior show. Not one to rest on his laurels, now he is selling his vast archive of clothing, all of which is currently listed on Grailed. The sale includes 135 items from his own brand, as well as a selection of personal items. One notable piece is the Leather King studded biker jacket that Lady Gaga’s “Telephone” video, which can be yours for $10,000. If you don’t have that reasonable amount of cash hanging around, other items start at $100, with each one accompanied by an anecdote written by the designer. Explaining why he decided to sell his collection, Williams said he would much prefer the pieces were being worn and enjoyed, rather than being held in a storage unit. He told Vogue, “I think one of the reasons for me to do this project was that I hadn’t ever really been able to talk about the past 10 years of my work with my voice and have it just be exactly what happened from my point of view.” A portion of the proceeds from the sale will go towards the MWW x SOL initiative, which benefits an orphanage in Kenya. Along with the archive sale, Grailed and Williams have published a timeline which charts the designer’s career and personal life, including his work on the Dior show, the time he made Kanye a custom jacket for the Grammys, and his #BEENTRILL# years. The collection is now available to purchase on Grailed.

"Ever wished a stranger could break up with someone for you? Ever needed to tell your platonic friend that you're completely in love with them but can't bring yourself to do it? Artist/actress/writer Miranda July's new app ""Somebody"" lets strangers deliver messages verbally, meaning that you can legitimately say ""At least I broke up with you face to face"". To accompany the app's launch, July directed a film for Miu Miu's acclaimed Women's Tales series. Shown at the Venice Film Festival along with So Yong Kim's Spark and Light, Somebody is a ten minute short that explores the tenderness of modern relationships and light-heartedly demonstrates the app's function. One of the reasons that the Somebody film looks so good is because the cinematographer who worked on it is Sebastian Wintero, the man responsible for Sia's incredible Maddie Ziegler-inspired Chandelier video; another reason is that July worked hard to carefully integrate Miu Miu clothes into the film, making for well-dressed characters and a stylish aesthetic. The app works by sending a message intended for you to the nearest Somebody user, who then has to track you down to deliver the information. July says about the app: ""Half-app / half-human, ""Somebody"" is a far-reaching public art project that incites performance and twists our love of avatars and outsourcing — every relationship becomes a three-way. The antithesis of the utilitarian efficiency that tech promises, here, finally, is an app that makes us nervous, giddy, and alert to the people around us."" Interested? Go and get it here.

"For three days, an abandoned supermarket in Berlin will be turned into a concept store, bringing together music, fashion, and art for Browns Nomad. Described as a ‘unique retail roaming experience’, the event will see the London boutique take over the Mitte district, from November 14 to 17. A stellar line-up of performances includes artist OrtaMiklos, British ‘urban jazz’ musician IAMDDB, artist and DJ Juliana Huxtable, and No Shade collective. There will also be palm readings by Truth And/Or Consequences, tattooing by Louis Loveless, and panel talks from the likes of GmbH with Vogue Germany. With one-on-one private shopping and a clothing exchange with Dazed 100-er Duran Lantink, the performances, which will be spread across the three days, will sit alongside a curated selection of Browns products. Featuring designers such as Ancuta Sarca, Ahluwalia, and Mariah Esa, there will also be collaborations and capsules collections made exclusively for the event, available to buy. The concept store is now in its third successful iteration – while last year the British shop headed to LA, this time, the brand is partnering with multidisciplinary Berlin-based communication agency, Reference Studio, and working closely with the German capital’s local community. The multi-sensory shopping experience takes inspiration from Berlin’s idiosyncratic and creative spirit, viewing it through the lens of the enduring British brand. Visit Browns Nomad’s Berlin concept store at Supermarkt, Holzmarktstraße 66, 10179 Berlin-Mitte, from November 14 to 16.

"The garden is central to Dior’s history. As an avid gardener, Christian Dior's designs were inspired and nourished by the flowers and plants he surrounded himself with, and Maria Grazia Chiuri, now head of the storied house, is no different. Drawing inspiration from photographs of Christian Dior’s sister, Catherine, in which she is seen standing in her own garden surrounded by flowers, the designer built further on this theme for SS20, just a few months after presenting a Haute Couture show among a series of blooming rose bushes. Bringing the outdoors in this season, the show saw models weave their way around a series of trees, all of which had a label reading #plantingforthefuture hanging from their branches. Chiuri's aim was to create an ‘inclusive garden’, according to the show’s accompanying notes. All of the trees were sourced from nurseries France, Germany, and Italy, where they were taken because they were dying and in need of urgent care owing to Paris’s ‘subtropical climate’. “The idea was not just to think about the garden as inspiration for pretty prints for clothes; that’s not appropriate for the times we are living in. I know the history of the house of Dior very well, so it was about creating a dialogue with the present. Right now, we are all too aware of the importance of sustainability, and the state of the planet,” the designer told Vogue post-show. In-keeping with the show's botanical themes and the female gardener Chiuri drew inspiration from, the collection was full of floral prints, as seen across taffeta and organza gowns, oversized knitwear, and tailored suits. Looks were finished with raffia hats and worker boots. Elsewhere, hints of tie-dye were seen across trousers and long, flowing slip dresses. Though the house of Dior has not followed in the footsteps of Burberry and Dior by making its show carbon neutral this season, the subject of saving the earth is clearly on Chiuri's mind – with the trees from the show due to be re-planted in the Paris region in the coming weeks. Check out the full gallery above and take an in-depth look at the set below.

"Since it launched back in 2013, Los Angeles-based label BornxRaised’s main objective has been to highlight the gentrification that’s pushing the community out of Venice Beach. For founder and designer Spanto – who originally hails from Venice – this has previously manifested in ‘Gentrification is Genocide’ tees, but has now taken one step further in highlighting those most affected. For the label’s spring 2019 collection, Spanto has enlisted some of the area’s OG families – some whose roots in the neighbourhood go all the way back to 1906 – to feature in the accompanying lookbook. Shot by LA-based photographer Fabian Guerrero, it features eight different families shot in and around their houses, each wearing looks picked out by Spanto himself. “We wanted to capture real people who are living, breathing and hustling – the people who have been around what Venice and LA really is,” Guerrero tells us. “Having them in their natural environment allowed us to represent both the clothing and what BornxRaised actually means.” As for the collection itself, the designer wanted to nod to the 80s and 90s, throwing back to the style he and his friends were wearing growing up then. “We took photos from the 80s and 90s to collage on our Hawaiian style button downs and coach jackets,” he explains. “I think it gives off the vibe we created surfing, playing handball, and just being kids.” Also included are oversized hoodies, flannels, and tees printed with the brand’s logo. Highlighting the gentrification of the community with the intention of hopefully put an end to it is something shared by both the designer and photographer. “This world is almost completely gone,” says an exasperated Spanto. Gurrero echoes this, adding: “To see the real Venice and not the hipster, gentrified Venice that most people see was very special. I hope people can take away the sense of family, love, hustle, community, and strength that I was able to see.” See more from the lookbook including quotes from the featured families in the gallery above.

"If you aren’t familiar with RtA, it’s the LA-based brand that has been playing with denim and second-skin silhouettes since it was founded in 2013. Designed by duo Eli Azran and David Rimokh, it continues to riff on that with each collection. Its latest collection – Resort 2018 – takes heavy inspiration from the 80s and 90s which the pair connote with glamour and a rock and roll edge. Think vinyl trousers and trench coats, sequined dresses, oversized sleeves and a dark base palette with splashes of colour. Photographer Esther Theaker and stylist Louise Ford collaborated to shoot the collection with the model Chizoba looking as if she is on her way to (or coming back from) a huge party.

Taking to Instagram, Wallace let the girls have it. “I am not sure who told Kylie Jenner and Kendall Jenner that they had the right to do this. This is disrespectful, disgusting, and exploitation at its worst!!!” According to her, the Jenners did not contact her or anyone at the estate asking to use Biggie’s likeness. Not to mention the fact that Kendall and Kylie have superimposed their own faces over the rapper and slapped an $125 price tag on the tees. There is no word from Tupac’s estate as of yet, but no doubt they’ll be equally unhappy. There was a quick response from the sisters and their company and the products have since been pulled from the website. Both sisters took to Twitter to apologise for the designs, explaining that they “are huge fans of (the artists’) music and it was not our intention to disrespect these cultural icons in any way”. It’s not the first time Kendall and Kylie have received such backlash. Just a few weeks ago, alleged claims surfaced of Kylie copying an independent label’s designs, and we all know about that Pepsi advert. Kendall commented that she and her sister will “learn from these mistakes”. Only time will tell...

"Yes, you read correctly. The Russian designer – who has been working on his eponymous label since 2008 – announced on Instagram that he will no longer be creating seasonal collections and that “something new is coming” instead. Cue tears of hypebeasts across the world. Why? Well, that much is still unclear. Although the hashtag on the post suggests that he will be focusing on the skate brand Paccbet, that he collaborates on with his best friend and muse Tolia Titaev. Without working on his collections, Rubchinskiy might also be able to explore photography and image-making, something he has always integrated into the brand. Rubchinskiy’s label has had its highlights including his recent three-season homecoming tour around Russia and his ongoing collaborations with Burberry, adidas Football, and Fila. Not to mention his SS17 interlude in Florence for Pitti Uomo. We wish Rubchinskiy all the best in the future, and can’t wait to see what he comes up with next.

"This week, Robyn takes over the site as guest editor. Here, the Swedish pop icon shines the spotlight on one of her favourite upcoming fashion talents, Anders Haal. Forget everything you thought you knew about Scandinavian fashion – designer Anders Haal’s sexually subversive collections offer a bold new perspective very different from the stereotypical minimalism his country is known for. Having engaged in creative pursuits from a young age, it was photography, not design, that first got Haal interested in fashion. “For me, photography is still a big part of what’s fun about fashion,” he explains. Realising he could use photos he had taken around the city as inspiration, those images became the moodboards for his collections. “I like to sample and cut things together, from piles of research images.” After deciding to make the move into clothing, Haal cut his teeth working alongside designer Ann-Sofie Back before launching his eponymous label in 2013. Since then, he has quietly honed his aesthetic, which he describes as “carefree but with a subcultural DNA, often playing with references from iconic heritage.” The label’s designs have all the Scandi sensibilities you might expect from a Swedish label, just subverted to become far more sexually-charged. Think slinky baby-doll dresses with straps that hang seductively off the shoulder, mesh skirts and tops, oversized men’s polo shirts, and seemingly well-loved jackets with distressed, chewed-up cuffs. “I want my clothes to tell a story through the wearer, so, for me, the best thing is bumping into people on the street wearing my designs – I learn so much by studying them and how they wear the pieces,” Haal explains. “It’s also been great to see pop girls like Kelela, FKA twigs, and Robyn wearing my stuff too.” The designer first worked with Robyn in 2016, when he created the cover artwork for her RMX/RBN project – they have continued working together ever since. “She’s really a wonderful creative with an open mind,” he muses. For the designer’s latest collection, eschewing the tradition of a show, presentation, or lookbook, he joined forces with creative director Nicole Walker to present his designs in the form of a book, produced with the support of the Swedish Fashion Council. “The idea was more about portraying a world, rather than a full collection of garments,” Haal says of the decision. Entitled Borders, the book “questions otherness, separation, and power hierarchies, and looks at how racism and borders define the world’s landscape.” Imagining life some light years away, it features work from a number of photographers – including Chris Maggio, Alex de Brabant, J Ari King, Henrik Alm, and Valter Törsleff – and is split into chapters exploring nature, humanity, and reality. “By looking at the common things that touch each of us in our everyday lives, we can see how we as an entire species are not separated, and how we stand on common ground,” the designer explains. “There is no ‘them’, only ‘we’.” Haal wants to continue down the path he is currently forging. “I really believe in working on finding new ways of presenting fashion,” he concludes. “Keeping concepts tight and exploring subjects deeper. I try to surprise myself all the time.” @andershaal | @_nicowalker_

"When we sit down with Luka Sabbat, it’s July 4, and he’s got FOMO. In the past eight months, Sabbat has touched home twice. One day he’s consulting for global brands, the next he’s front row at Paris Fashion Week – or documenting it as part of collective duo Hot Mess, which he works on with Noah Dillon. Born into a fashion family (his mother was a stylist before later becoming a chef, and his father is a designer), Sabbat was initially hesitant to follow into the industry, but having grown up between NYC and Paris, it proved hard to resist. On one of his recent trips to London, we sat down with Sabbat as part of Persol’s live interview series Good Point, Well Made – which you may have seen on our Instagram. It’s inspired by Andy Warhol’s screen tests, where he would interview the most exciting faces of the 60s, only this time we’re asking questions submitted by our readers. Scroll to see five things we learnt during our chat. It’s hard to break into the creative industries. Sabbat used what he had at his disposal: the internet and a beautiful face, first becoming a model and then leveraging that into opportunities to do what he really wanted to. He used the example of hard work and independence set for him by Virgil Abloh and ran with it, establishing Hot Mess, the creative duo of Sabbat and Noah Dillon (who he met after sliding in his DMs on Twitter dot com). Since, Sabbat has proved himself as far more than just ‘a model kid from New York’, putting out clothing collections, art shows, and books. So, time to get resourceful. We might not all be really, really ridiculously good looking, but what tools do we have at our disposal that could help us get where we want to be? Remember the summer when your perfectly crafted MySpace page suddenly meant nothing because Facebook had arrived? Or the exact moment you realised you were late to the Instagram party? Sabbat is spot on when he says that we need to always be prepared for something new, whether that’s a platform, a trend, or something else – culture will always need a counter, in some way. “I find it exciting, I also find it interesting, I always think: ‘When is the bubble going to pop?’” One more time for the freelancers in the back! Anyone working in the creative industry as a freelancer has learnt this lesson, one way or another. For someone like Sabbat, working without an office and with multiple companies in multiple disciplines, being able to work efficiently and manage time well is absolutely key: “Alright, you’re here for three days – not a day less not a day more. You have these things to do in these three days. As long as that’s done in those three days, you’re good to go.” The internet is wonderful, full of information and opportunity. But The Internet™ can be mean, false, and frankly quite scary. The idea that there is more to this industry and this world than meets the eye is essential to maintaining a healthy relationship with the world wide web, so thanks for reminding us that while we could find out closest and most successful collaborators on the internet, like Sabbat did with Dillon, huge follower numbers don’t mean everything. As Sabbat put it: “Some people think the number of followers matter – but they don’t. It’s about who follows you.” When overnight success isn’t earned through hard work and a clear understanding of who you are and what you’re doing, it can be dangerous. With great follower numbers comes great responsibility, and if you get there too quickly, you can easily forget that. Don’t rush the process, and understand what you’re trying to achieve, and hopefully longevity will follow. In the words of Sabbat: “I think why I have a really good following is because people see me grow over time, instead of overnight. I’m only twenty but five, six years of my life is a lot for me to be doing this.”

"We halfway through April, hurtling at an ever-increasing rate towards festival season. Before Glastonbury throws open its gates following two years off the schedule, and pretty much every single resident of the East London area descends on the newly (newly) relocated Field Day, last weekend saw hordes of #influencers – with varying levels of influence – land in the desert of Southern California for the first event of the year. That’s right: Coachella is upon us. With weekend one of the extravaganza down, we’ve already seen the likes of Childish Gambino, Aphex Twin, Billie Eilish, Christine and the Queens, and Ariana Grande, in her hugely anticipated Sunday night headline spot, take to the stage – and, on Friday we’re about to do it all over again. But, for better or worse, when it comes to Coachella, it’s as much about what you’re wearing as it is the music. And while there were plenty of fringed, boho dresses and flower crowns – the trend that just won’t quit! – there were plenty of people who served us some serious looks. Dev Hynes, performing as Blood Orange, went for one of Asai’s incredible Hot Wok tops, as worn underneath a denim all-in-one, while Cardi B showed up to perform a surprise set with Selena Gomez wearing a Medieval-inspired embroidered corset by McQueen. McQueen. In the desert. For real. Of all the people that showed up though, there was one who really stood out: step forward Lizzo. The “Juice” singer, whose album is due to be released this Friday (watch this space for more), arrived on stage looking like an IRL superhero, complete with silver sequinned cape and matching high-cut leotard. Between this and the fact she brought friend Janelle Monae out for a twerk-off, the set was soon dubbed #ASSCHELLA across social media. “My work is all about fantasy and the power clothes have to transform. Fashion should be democratic – everyone has the right to be a star” – Brad Callahan The look was the work of LA-based designer Brad Callahan, who has previously created a series of full-on fantasies for the boundary-pushing performer, as well as Nicki Minaj, Drag Race winner Aquaria, and Queen of the Club Kids herself, Susanne Bartsch under his label BCALLA. Callahan’s interest in fashion was sparked at a young age, when he found himself inspired by his older brother’s comic book collection, and more particularly, the ones with female leads, including Lady Death, Witchblade, and Dawn. It was in 2004 that he realised fashion was the direction he wanted to go in: “When I saw the Dior AW04 show, I knew exactly what I wanted to do with my life,” he recalls. When it came to Lizzo’s brief, stylist Marko Monroe gave him only two specifications: “They knew they wanted something reflective or shiny and I’ve been working on this petal technique for a while now, which me and my team thought would be a good fit,” Callahan explains. “My partner and I hand cut seven-and-a-half yards of vinyl and my seamstress appliquèd them by hand. It took a week of round-the-clock work.” As one of a small – but thankfully growing, albeit slowly – number of designers authentically creating for a wide and diverse range of body types and sizes, with his wildly fabulous, dramatic designs, Callahan is intent on changing the fashion landscape when it comes to inclusivity. “I’ve always been kind of a bigger guy, which has been a driving force behind my dedication to working with artists of all sizes,” he says. “My work is all about fantasy and the power clothes have to transform. BCALLA believes that fashion should be democratic and that everyone has the right to be a star. That’s the fantasy that my clothes are built on.” Amen to that.

"Last month, legendary photographer Bill Cunningham passed away at the age of 87. A pioneer of the street style photography, Cunningham spent over four decades documenting what people were wearing on the streets of New York. Now, the city is paying homage to the photographer – by renaming one of his favourite stakeouts after him. It began as a Change.org petition, which has attracted over 6,000 signatures, calling for the mayor of New York to rename the corner of Fifth Avenue and 57th Street ‘Bill Cunningham Corner’ in his honour. He agreed and yesterday, a renaming ceremony took place to make it official – an event which was attended by the deputy mayor of New York, Alicia Glen, the former curator at the Met’s Costume Institute, Harold Koda and the executive editor of The New York Times, Dean Baquet. “Bill Cunningham turned our sidewalks into runways and New Yorkers into models,” the mayor, Bill de Blasio, said in a statement. “His vivid photos captured our city’s diversity in every sense of the word, and helped define New York as the fashion capital of the world.” Unfortunately, it’s only temporary as permanent street namings don’t happen very often and involve a lot of “complicated legislative process” according to The New York Times. That said, the mayor’s office told Racked that it “will continue to work with the Council, the community, and Bill’s friends and colleagues on a permanent way to honor his legacy.”

"As well as his fashion design and photography, Gosha Rubchinskiy is known for the community of young, talented people around him. Among them is teenage British skater and photographer Tom Emmerson, who modelled in his AW16 show. Another example is 16-year-old Russian skater and artist Valentin Fufaev aka @doublecheeseburgervf, who also modelled in this show, and is now staging an exhibition at Rubchinskiy’s space at Dover Street Market London. The exhibition, opening on June 10th, will be accompanied by a zine entitled DoublecheeseburgerVF (some exclusive excerpts of which are featured in the gallery below) and a clothing line (which is featured in the gallery above). For this project, Rubchinskiy gave Fufaev complete creative freedom, and so he’s behind everthing, from the artwork and video projection in the exhibition, the photography in the zine, the clothes in the line and the images of its accompanying lookbook. Here, Fufaev and president of Comme des Garçons and the mastermind behind Dover Street Market, Adrian Joffe, go head-to-head. Adrian Joffe: What is inside your dreams double cheeseburger? Valentin Fufaev: There are a lot of things inside my dreams. Adrian Joffe: Do you have a dream to eat a double cheeseburger in America and if so in which city could you like to eat it? Valentin Fufaev: Gosha hates Doublecheeseburgers. Adrian Joffe: Do you remember when you first started to skateboard? Valentin Fufaev: Well I got my first skateboard when I was like 10 but seriously I started skating 2 years ago. Adrian Joffe: Is art for you a way of expressing your inner feelings i.e. something inside you that has to come out, or just fun? Valentin Fufaev: I think that art is something highly spiritual for me. I think that art is above me. Adrian Joffe: What do you like best: skateboarding, eating doublecheesburgers, painting or watching soap operas? Valentin Fufaev: WATCHING SOAP OPERAS AAAHAHAH LOL Adrian Joffe: Is Russia these days a hard place to say what you want and do what you like? Valentin Fufaev: No. Adrian Joffe: Russia has a deep incredible culture. Do you feel really Russian deep down or do you feel a man of the world and it doesn’t matter where you are? You can be happy anywhere? Valentin Fufaev: I feel like a Russian cheeseburger. Adrian Joffe: Would you like to have a very very big fridge? Valentin Fufaev: I already have one. Adrian Joffe: Do you believe in the fourth dimension? Valentin Fufaev: I'm already there. Adrian Joffe: Who would you prefer to have dinner with Gosha Rubchinskiy or Beyoncé? Valentin Fufaev: With Kanye West. Watch DoublecheeeburgerVF below:

"Since 2011, Miu Miu’s Women’s Tales series has been giving female directors a platform on which to tell their stories. Following in the footsteps of the likes of Chloë Sevigny, Miranda July, and Skate Kitchen’s Crystal Moselle, this season Haifaa Al-Mansour takes the reins, with new film The Wedding Singer’s Daughter making its debut at the Venice Film Festival last night (and fortunately, this time around, the premiere was not struck by lightning). Oscar-nominated Al-Mansour – the first female Saudi Arabian filmmaker – trains her lens on a Saudi wedding party in the 1980s, as the women present take off their traditional abayas and literally let their hair down away from the male gaze – there are strict segregation rules at Saudi weddings. Underneath are (surprise!) a series of Miu Miu dresses, blouse and skirt sets, and one particular standout in the form of a wide-shouldered, puff-sleeved PVC jacket, as seen as part of the Italian label’s rebellious AW18 collection. In the film, the party’s wedding singer (played by Saudi pop star Rotana Tarabzouni) falls victim to some technical difficulties as the venue's power cuts out, and it’s up to her young daughter to figure out how to get it back on before the bride and groom arrive. Ignoring the girls on the next table who exclaim that “she and her mom will go to hell, all singers do,” she dashes backstage and (spoiler!) manages to reconnect the electricity just in time. “Weddings are the mirror of society in Saudi Arabia: they’re segregated and fragmented along gender and class. I wanted to tell the story of these women, and capture that tenderness,” explains Al-Mansour. “For me, the little girl represents the future. And the future belongs to outsiders.” Watch the full film below.

"New York Fashion Week is a big talking point at the moment. Joseph Altuzarra has announced that he’ll be following Proenza Schouler and Rodarte to switch NY for Paris, and the entire schedule has been cut by a day. The latest news is that IMG, the week’s producer, is taking steps to make the whole affair more accessible to the public. Well, kind of. With a new service called “NYFW: The Experience”, shows will now be open to loyal customers and high-end corporate clients, with a full package including VIP access to the shows, a serviced hospitality suite, and in person contact with the designers and models. It’s not the first time that designers have opened shows up – or tried to make them more consumer-friendly. Riccardo Tisci and Marina Abramoviç released 800 tickets online to Givenchy’s AW15 show in New York on a first-come, first-served basis, while Tommy Hilfiger has started staging customer-focussed events rather than traditional runways. Commenting on the turn of events, Mark Shapiro, co-president of IMG, told WWD: ""We’ve had incredible demand from brands, designers and people who recognise that NYFW and global fashion weeks are changing and evolving."" He continued, ""To be able to get a front-row seat to the action is such a unique experience."" He added, ""Everyone is wondering what goes into creating fashion week? What is it actually like to be behind the curtain?"" If you’re a big spender, you might get to find out come September...

"Naomi Campbell has never been scared to call out the fashion industry for its sometimes latent, sometimes blatant racism. In 2013 she partnered with fellow supermodel Iman and former model agent Bethann Hardison to form the Diversity Coalition, which called for an end to runway racism. But, as she admits in this new interview with Nick Knight for SHOWstudio, things haven’t changed. This was proved yesterday by Sudanese model Nykhor Paul who, in an Instagram caption beginning “Dear white people in the fashion world"", slammed the industry for its racism. “I’m tired of complaining about not getting booked as a black model and I’m definitely super tired of apologising for my blackness!” she wrote. But why is racism still an issue? Well, according to Campbell, it's down to ignorance or (as she puts it) “territorialism” – the industry’s refusal to change. This is something that Knight, like Campbell, has not been afraid to call out. “The business people that ultimately control fashion have a moral responsibility that they must not ignore,” reads a slide in the video below. “Profit cannot be a justification for bigotry and racism.” Here’s our five favourite quotes from the pair’s conversation on racism in fashion. NAOMI CAMPBELL HAS A WHATSAPP GROUP FOR HER BLACK MODEL ‘BABIES’ “I have to watch out for my babies,” she says. In this group, which includes Jourdan Dunn, Joan Smalls, Malaika Firth and Riley Montana, the girls can show solidarity with each other. “A lot of them, their hearts were broken this time in Paris. I got the calls, I got the texts,” Campbell goes on. MIUCCIA PRADA IS A HERO Many industry figures failed to respond to Campbell’s Diversity Coalition or, worse, took a step backward. However, according to Campbell, “Miuccia has been amazing.” At Prada's AW15 show she championed some of the best new faces of colour – Aya Jones, Amilna Estevão, Lineisy Montero, Mica Arganaraz and Dylan Xue. THE STATS DON'T LOOK GOOD “2014, we’ve just finished the shows – 6.8% (of models were black). Asian –7.9%. Not great,” says Campbell, shaking her head. Her stats indicate that 85.3% of models walking at the major fashion weeks of New York, London, Milan and Paris were white. As Campbell says, that's not great. BLACK MODELS ARE NOT A TREND “What we want to say is, ‘We are not a trend!’ It shouldn't have to be that way,” she says. “I don't want it to be a trend. I didn’t work 28 years for it to be a trend.” Yep, ethnicity is not and should not be a fad that comes in one season and goes out the next. CASTING SHOULD REFLECT THE CUSTOMER “You know it's not just one colour walking into a store and buying clothes, it's everybody!” Amen, Naomi.

"Off the back of her SS20 show which took over an abandoned theatre inside Alexandra Palace, Simone Rocha is set to release her fifth self-published photography book with images taken by Harley Weir. This time around the Irish designer reflects on ideas of intimacy, privacy, security, and femininity; concepts which informed her AW19 collection. Presenting trench coats with organza layering, exposed bralets, and skirts and dresses embossed with floral prints, the show was a study of female eroticism, looking into the tension of women being an object of desire, and wanting to own it and direct it. Alongside artworks by Louise Bourgeois, the book will feature models who walked in the AW19 show, such as Dazed cover star Chloë Sevigny and Lily Cole. Styled by Dazed’s own Robbie Spencer, Chloë Sevigny’s latest Dazed’s cover also makes an appearance. Launched on 5th October, the book will be available at Dover Street Market London and Simone Rocha stores worldwide.

"LFW might be here already, but all the drama from NYFW seems to be continuing. After starting his SS19 show 90 minutes late, Marc Jacobs has taken to Instagram to apologise. “I sincerely apologise to anyone and everyone who was inconvenienced by my lateness at our Spring/Summer 2019 fashion show,” the post read, going on to explain a list of facts (not excuses) as to why. He explains that as always, he planned to start his show on time, but realised in the afternoon it would be an hour late – something that was communicated (accidentally) as half an hour by the team working on the day. Legend has it that after his SS08 show – which ran two hours late – Anna Wintour walked out, and Jacobs has made sure to start his shows promptly ever since. On Twitter, some speculated that the designer let the show run late on purpose, as a jab at Rihanna. While Jacobs usually closes NYFW, it was announced before the shows started that RiRi’s Savage x Fenty would be the new finale. Regardless of the reason, with all of the fabulous frou frou that sashayed down the runway, we forgive you Marc.

"Founded in Singapore in 1996 by brothers Charles and Keith Wong, footwear company CHARLES & KEITH began by selling shoes bought from wholesale suppliers. Before too long, the brothers ditched this idea and began making their own designs, listening to customer feedback to tailor and refine their creations. Now, the label is making its entrance to the European scene. Unsurprisingly, the two quickly made a discovery: listening to the women wearing your products actually works! From that point onwards, the two brothers have aimed to cater for women keen to add their own creative interpretation to their favourite outfits; the newly-released AW18 campaign, titled ‘Make Your Mark’, reinforces this ethos by encouraging women to take control and embrace the joy of putting together a genuinely different look. The campaign imagery itself is lensed by Harley Weir, the trailblazing photographer renowned for her unconventional twist on the ‘female gaze’ – and shooting the first lady of punk herself, Dame Viv for Dazed’s latest issue. Weir brings her unique aesthetic – one rooted in a blend of energy, intimacy, and sensuality – to the table, easily encapsulating the strength and modernity that Charles & Keith set out to communicate. An accompanying campaign video is more free-spirited; models Elizabeth Davidson and Rose Daniels make their mark (literally) on a London rooftop and generally embrace the carefree attitude that defines the new collection. Ultimately, the message is simple: fashion is about creativity – and embracing the joy of dressing up on your own terms. Watch the campaign video below, and head to the CHARLES & KEITH website to see the full collection.

"It made sense that Craig Green chose the Medici family’s Boboli Gardens as the venue for his Florence guest spot at Pitti Uomo last night. Like the walking sculptures that inhabit his runways, the fragrant geometric grounds are home to a vast collection of statues that appear with ceremonial grandeur at the end of a gravel avenue or surprise you as you find a secret space behind an imposing hedge. It’s also a stark yet romantic place, where your perspective changes at every garden path turn. And perspective was very much on Green’s mind this season. Here’s what went down. Green had come across a photo of a woman who appeared to have a black halo or aura around her, formed from another person’s shadow. “Almost her guardian angel,” he said. At the same time, the team had been constructing running tops that looked as if their wings had been clipped off “in a kind of abstract way” and of course explored the workwear that always informs Green’s collections, styled by Dazed’s creative director, Robbie Spencer. This time it was the simplistic lines of a cleaner’s tabard, or the smock a hospital worker might wear, which were elevated to something almost ceremonial. It was a really beautiful idea: honouring the angel workers that quietly surround us and tend to be much overlooked in a society that instead worships gilded but often empty celebrity. “They kind of have your life in their hands,” Green said. “I’ve always liked the idea that someone can become like an angel through doing good in their lives. It puts the value in a person rather than putting value in objects.” Like all the best people, Green is a horror movie fan, and last night had a definite twang of good and evil battling it out – or perhaps just accepting each other and coexisting. The black halo reference had a sinister side to it: the collection’s sculptures were carried on the models’ backs and traced the body like the chalk lines from a crime scene, only rendered in blood red. It was also quite It Follows. Or a target silhouette at a shooting range. And the second Green mentioned the dyed and shrunk prints that resembled old TV static you couldn’t help but think Poltergeist. They’re heeere! In line with the team’s explorations of different perspectives and how that can change the appearance of things or even warp reality, prints that looked like they were vibrating or almost 3D were anything but. Instead, various kinds of ‘normal’ fabrics had been printed and then placed and layered to give that effect. It was hard not to think of this tribute to the everyday worker in a political context, but Green said he doesn’t approach his work in this way. “I think everyone is reacting to the environment around them or things that feel right at the time but I don’t aim for it to be political. It’s not a political reference. Usually in the beginning we don’t even know what it’s about. It’s not like we go to make a top that looks like someone’s had their wings clipped. I guess it’s more of a reaction-y kind of process. Lots of cutting up and remaking and throwing away kind of process!” From the invite that had a cut-out circle to the giant black curtains that divided the Boboli lawn and revealed the models as they filed in and out between them, the show gave us glimpses into what’s on the other side. An idea of an afterlife, perhaps, as Green put it. The last three looks – monk-like blankets tied with ropes – gave a psychedelic view on that with what appeared like bright ghostly images, aura colours and a blurry angel blowing a trumpet. Whatever lies behind the veil, Craig Green was optimistic about it: “There’s positivity. That idea of hope in some way.”

"Following hot on the heels of LFWM, the fashion crowd headed over to Italy to continue the SS20 menswear season – starting in Florence at Pitti Uomo before moving on to Milan. Switching up the schedule, though, were Milan regulars Prada and Moschino, who both went international. Prada travelled across the world to Shanghai, while Jeremy Scott took over Hollywood’s Universal Studios sending models like drag superstar Violet Chachki down the runway as Morticia Addams and other cult horror icons. In Florence, we got our first look at Sterling Ruby’s brand new fashion label, and witnessed Clare Waight Keller’s first standalone menswear show for Givenchy. In Milan, Fendi changed its regular show setting, taking over an Italian garden. Elsewhere, Versace headed back to the 90s and Philipp Plein staged a true to style, overly extra show. ICYMI, we rounded up all the backstage images from the shows that might have passed you by. For her first ever standalone menswear show, designer Clare Waight Keller headed to Pitti Uomo to present her SS20 collection. Taking place at the Villa Palmieri, the collection – entitled Nouveau Glitch – was inspired by Charles Baudelaire’s floral book cover graphics and Hubert de Givenchy’s family connections to French tapestry making. Talking on her other main influence for the collection, Korean street style, Waight Keller explained post-show: “It has that sense of freedom almost similar to what Brits did in the 80s and 90s, particularly in menswear. It’s very eclectic, with heavy jewellery.” The show’s looks were completed with all-white trainers, courtesy of a brand new collaboration with Japanese brand Onitsuka Tiger: a personal favourite of Waight Keller. Elsewhere in Florence, American artist Sterling Ruby released his highly anticipated new fashion brand S.R STUDIO. LA. CA. Presented to an audience that included friend and frequent collaborator Raf Simons, the show was a long time coming for both fans of his work and Ruby himself – who started making clothes at the age of 13 after being gifted a sewing machine by his mum. The brand is split into four different lines, which each represent a culmination of decades of his experimentation with different mediums of art, including textile and sculpture. The main line carries the name of the brand, while the other lines are ED5 50, a selection of limited edition made in bulks of 50; the SOTO line, which consists of pieces with fabric handworked by Sterling Ruby Studio, in numbers determined by the amount of fabric available. The final UNIQUE line made up of one-of-a-kind pieces all handcrafted by Ruby himself. When discussing how he would navigate his unique structure, Ruby explained he would not follow a season format, but instead go back to LA and rebuild the individual lines to continue to present them “instinctively, democratically, and without hierarchy”. On Saturday night, Donatella Versace presented her 90s inspired SS20 Versace menswear show. Although a menswear show, the catwalk was still graced by her usual womenswear faves Gigi, Bella, Adut Akech, Stella Maxwell and Dazed 100 model Mona Tougaard. Models walked out with horned pink, yellow, and green hair – an ode to Donatella's friend Keith Flint, who passed away earlier this year. The soundtrack paid further homage, featuring rave classic “Firestarter” and “No Good (Start the Dance)”. The collection itself featured a series of 50/50 grey and black suits, bold baroque print trousers, shirts with sports car motifs and tie-dye shirts. Leopard print also made an appearance throughout the collection, featuring across blazers and low cut cowboy boots – yes, the Yee Haw agenda is still prominent. Elsewhere, the Versace man this season remained sophisticated in cinched leather trenches, classic black ties, and buttoned-shirts: v New Wave. Entitled ‘Monsters of Rock’, Philipp Plein’s SS20 was even more of an extravagant celebration – yes, even topping the one with the spaceship – this time offering up the designer's interpretation of rock and roll. The show featured neon, Mad Max-esque trucks, a LOT of fire, and close to 100 looks on over 80 models, including the likes of Teddy Quinlivan and Dazed 100 model Aweng. The post-apocalyptic collection included tailoring with metallic animal patterns and sequined stars, as wells as trousers accented with vampire mouth prints, while the womenswear consisted of thigh-high buckled boots, studded corsets, and metallic floor-length dresses completed with biker jackets. Elsewhere, a collaboration with rock band KISS debuted. It was... a lot. On the closing day of MFW, Fendi presented its latest collection. Shown in a beautiful Italian garden, the set was enough to make us all wishful for the summer we’re currently missing. The collection featured a collaboration with the Oscar-nominated director of Call Me By Your Name, Luca Guadagnino, who created a geometric print which appeared across shirts, tunics, and accessories. Elsewhere, other looks included denim cargo shorts and jumpsuits, oversized waxed jackets and summery, loose fitting shirts. The standout accessory, though, was a Fendi bag slash watering can – perfect for some fashionable summer gardening... if the weather ever permits it.

"“I’ve been fascinated by masks since the beginning of my career,” says Walter Van Beirendonck, speaking from The Wereldmuseum in Rotterdam, where his exhibition Power Mask – The Power of Masks opened last month, running until January next year. “I find ethnographic cultures and rituals so interesting; anything that centres around bodies, faces and changed personas. It’s a love that’s been there forever.” Of course, anyone familiar with the Belgian designer’s inimitable oeuvre knows this to be true: since ascending to fame in the 1980s as part of the Antwerp Six, Van Beirendonck has incorporated masks into his collections in myriad ways – from fetishistic face coverings and African Bozo designs to mask-like make-up painted on models’ faces and his various collaborations with milliner Stephen Jones to conjure whimsical, oversized masks and headpieces. Needless to say that when the celebrated ethnographic museum approached him to curate a show for them, the first thing that sprang to his mind was masks. “I’ve known the museum for a long time,” he says. “It’s very traditional, with a beautiful collection, but it’s also a little bit old-fashioned, presentation-wise. They had seen the exhibition that I curated at the Modern Art Museum in Rotterdam and felt I could bring a fresh perspective.” “I began by looking at masks in fashion, and then about how different artists across different disciplines and ages have been inspired by masks, and brought those ideas together with masks from the museum’s collection,” he explains of the concept behind the show, which includes works by such diverse creative forces as Robert Mapplethorpe, Picasso, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Louise Bourgeois, Cindy Sherman, Maison Margiela, Christian Dior, Jean Paul Gaultier and Viktor&Rolf. “It’s a very spontaneous project,” Van Beirendonck explains. “I selected everything from the heart. The very rough painted masks in the Basquiat works, for instance, aren’t necessarily masks but have a strong mask feeling to them, whereas other artists I included make explicit use of them in their work.” His approach to choosing objects from the Wereldmuseum collection was similarly instinctive: “I picked around 80 of their masks from Africa and Oceania, ones I really liked and which I felt would spell something out within the exhibition, and then we loaned other objects from museums in North and South America, from all over the world! My favourites are the huge dancing masks from Papua New Guinea, made from tree bark. They are so fantastical – these huge alien faces with big eyes; we’ve got a room filled with them in the show.” The entire exhibition is reflective of Van Beirendonck’s love of fantasy. “Enchantment was an important word for me during the curation process,” he says. “Often museums want to present things theoretically, but I just want enjoyment! I curate without fear, in a very nonconformist way, and I hope people will feel that when they come.” There seems little doubt that this will be the case, Van Beirendonck having carefully conceived each room to be both immersive and intriguing. “I tried to recreate the feeling of how these masks were used, and how they looked when they were worn in all sorts of different contexts: some are tribal; some have spiritual associations; there are torture masks from the Middle Ages; masks designed for Björk and Kylie Minogue.” “Some are tribal; some have spiritual associations; there are torture masks from the Middle Ages; masks designed for Björk and Kylie Minogue” – Walter Van Beirendonck The designer opted to use a number of 20th-century glass display cabinets throughout the exhibit, “but I painted yellow, blue, red, green to get rid of that dusty museum feeling,” he explains. The fashion designs meanwhile are sported by mannequins, who interact with the exhibition as if attending it: “One is wearing a fantastic piece by Galliano for Margiela and she’s sitting on an African throne like a queen.” The designer also approached three artists to create installations for the show: French photographer Charles Fréger, whose evocative series Wilder Mann explores folkloric tradition in Eastern Europe; Coco Fronsac, a French artist who paints masks over early 20th-century group photographs and American artist Brian Kenny, who has created prints for Van Beirendonck in the past and who spent 10 days painting a giant black and white mural for the show, “covered in mythical figures, who each wear a real mask”. Meanwhile, many of the rooms are geared towards sparking a dialogue between the works themselves and their viewers. “There’s a beautiful work by the Belgian (Modernist) painter James Ensor, which I’ve put with a Basquiat and a Mapplethorpe,” Van Beirendonck explains. “It’s really nice to feel this clash of different moments in time and to really see these strong artists come together in a new way. I wanted people to walk through the show and discover all these different things which are seemingly contrasting but which are actually all connected in some way; I tried to create a kind of tension, a story, throughout.” In this sense, the designer explains, he approaches curation much like he does a new collection. “Storytelling is important to me in everything that I do, and in this case, I’m inviting people to join a conversation; to dive into the world of masks, with all its weird, wonderful and diverse characters.” Power Mask – The Power of Masks is at The Wereldmuseum in Rotterdam until January 7.

"Taken from the autumn 2019 issue of Dazed. You can buy a copy of our latest issue here “I think dance has moulded my skeleton,” says American model and dancer Alton Mason, laughing. “When it’s time to walk or perform, my body just aligns with the energy in the room. Dancing is one of the most freeing things, one of the best ways of expressing yourself without words. It comes from within.” Scouted on Instagram while studying dance and acting at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy in Los Angeles, Mason grew up in Arizona on a diet of “movies like Poetic Justice and Juice, Spike Lee joints and Janet Jackson – I had the biggest crush on her...” When we speak, it’s Paris Men’s fashion week, where Mason is now a seasoned pro: a true original, he was the first black male model to walk for Chanel, and stole the show back-flipping down the runway for Virgil Abloh’s AW19 collection for Louis Vuitton. “It really touches me when black boys and girls say, ‘Wow, you inspire me, you make me wanna do this, because I see someone doing it who’s just like me’” – Alton Mason Besides his acrobatic skills, there’s something else that separates Mason from his peers: his relationship with Naomi Campbell, who he sees as a mentor. “She is the blueprint,” he says of the supermodel. “I grew up in the basketball world, so being able to be mentored by her – to chill, eat and travel with her – it’s almost as if Michael Jordan asked my dad to play one-on-one with him. Really, she means a lot to me.” With his success has come a platform – at the time of writing, Mason has 212k Instagram followers, and it’s the messages he receives on there that have been the most rewarding part of this experience. “It really touches me when black boys and girls say, ‘Wow, you inspire me, you make me wanna do this, because I see someone doing it who’s just like me.’ To be that inspiration, I cherish it, because that’s not originally how it was supposed to be. I was just supposed to be an example to my siblings. To be able to touch people from all around the world – from Africa to Brazil, America and Europe – is a blessing and I can only thank God for that.” Hair Yann Turchi at Bryant Artists using Mizani, make-up Mona Leanne at The Wall Group using NARS, model Alton Mason at IMG, set design Cesar Sebastien at Swan Management, photography assistants Roxane Moreau, Anthea Lovich, styling assistant Roland Herbemont, make-up assistant Sukhy Bhandal, set design assistant Enzo Selvatici, casting Noah Shelley at Streeters

"Not many fashion shows elicit as much hysteria as Kanye West’s. Before his Yeezy Season 2 show today had even started, queues at cinemas that were streaming it around the US and UK were reaching around the block, while those inside Periscoped the action. The shoes that were supposedly to be worn by models were “leaked” online, and a clip that appeared to show a rehearsal was hit Twitter, purporting to contain a snippet of an unreleased track. The show (unsurprisingly, if you’re familiar with fashion week) began late, causing people watching on Periscope to quoting the “Why you always lyin’” meme. That might have been down to the celebrities in the front row – which included Drake, Lorde, Debbie Harry, and Courtney Love – while Tyga, Kendall and Jaden were sitting in the second. But when things got underway, it was clear it wasn’t just your average runway – like last season, West collaborated once more with performance artist Vanessa Beecroft, who helped orchestrate the occasion. Under four strips of white lights, models were directed across the stage like an army squadron by a drill sergeant, being asked to march in neat lines before filing out. The first group wore light beige outfits, the second pale green, before looks turned to khaki and brown and finally a dark shade of black – choices that seemed to mirror the shades of the models’ skintones. The clothes were utilitarian and seemingly army-inspired (and prompted a fair few comparisons to the forest scenes in Return of the Jedi). Instagram It-boys Luka Sabbat and Ian Connor (casually smoking a cigarette), and rising star Michael Lockley were all amongst the ranks, along with Bella Hadid and Kylie Jenner. At the end of the show, the entire cast filled the stage while a track – believed to be a new, unreleased song by the artist – blasted across the speakers (last season, the musician dropped a track with Sia at the presentation). Finally, West himself appeared, walking to the front to take his bow. On the Dazed Periscope stream live from the front row, people were busy discussing the merits of fashion’s relationship with art, as well as the way that West seamed to use models of different skin colours to tell his story (and begging that we film Kim Kardashian). But West’s return to fashion week wasn’t welcomed by everyone – some designers spoke up after he apparently stole their spot on the schedule. According to Racked (via a dubious source at The Mirror), the show’s models – a streetcast group – had to sign a $10m non disclosure agreement promising not to give away the details.

"Mike Eckhaus and Zoe Latta are no strangers to experimentation. For SS15, they sent models down a runway littered with lettuce. Some wobbled down it in double stacked trainers, others a little more stably with their legs painted to look like tube socks. For their new campaign video however, the pair have taken experimentation to the next level. Titled Roach, the film features a series of shots: the ocean (seen through a septum piercing), a cockcroach writhing around on its back, a man urinating in a field and a penis covered in smoked salmon. To create it, the designers have enlished two of their longtime collaborators German filmmaker Alexa Karolinski, who shot the film and hip-hop producer Dev Hynes, who scored it. Instead of models, the video features fellow members of New York’s underground fashion gang: one third of Moses Gauntlett Cheng David Moses, artists John-Mercer Moore and Skye Chamberlain, and photographer Rob Kulisek. As well as Hynes’ soundtrack, the video footage is accompanied by a poetry reading from artist Nora Slade. This poem (see below) was writted by the designers themselves. One night I laid in bed and listened to you cry on the other side of the wall as you watched an entire season of Mad Men until the sun came up Your cursor on the white brick wall It was like living on an island The cars stuck in traffic in the near distance of the onramp Loosing sight of a private life You painted your bedroom with like a green screen with the hope of being elsewhere Some weeks we wouldn't leave the house Watching the neighbours chihuahua out the window mount a fallen branch of pine in crow pose wondering: “What does it feel like to wake up as him?” ROACH from alexa karolinski on Vimeo.

"Throughout her career, Kate Moss has been the poster girl for almost everyone, industry heavyweights like Saint Laurent and Alexander Wang. Now, she fronts the new Alexander McQueen AW19 campaign. To produce the images, designer Sarah Burton took her team to her hometown in the Northern English countryside. Photographed by Jamie Hawkesworth in a field and a mill, Moss dons sharply tailored masculine suits – one of red wool silk and the other in worsted flannel – and a bouffant red dress from the AW19 collection. In the show notes, Burton explains the colour is a nod to the Red Rose of Lancaster. “The collection is inspired by the bolts of cloth we saw woven both by man and machine,” she says. The campaign follows on from more AW19 images recently released, such as Billie Eilish for MCM and Balenciaga’s IRL couples.

"Body image is a big issue right now, particularly in fashion. Campaigns like #DropThePlus highlight the growing unease over the obsession with size zero, alongside concerns that not enough is done to protect models from the pressures of staying thin. But Denmark's fashion industry is stepping up with a stringent set of new rules and regulations. Before working with models, brands must carry out psychological and physical evaluation, in order to catch any signs of an eating disorder or mental health issues. There is a minimum age requirement of 16, and models must also receive monetary payment for their work (which, in an industry run on gifting samples in lieu of cash, is a pretty big deal). And there's no shirking it either – if you're a brand that wants to show at Copenhagen Fashion Week, then you must agree to abide by the regulations. The Danish Fashion Ethical Charter was first established in 2007. Significantly, the revamped rules are not orders from the government; this is an industry-led initiative that has support from Denmark's eight biggest modelling agencies, along with trade associations and eating disorder charities. Eva Kruse, the CEO of Danish Fashion Institute and Copenhagen Fashion Week, acknowledged that the country could be seen to have a bad track record on model health. Most recently, the Danish magazine Cover was criticised for featuring a model that some readers slammed as ""emaciated"". (One Reddit thread even asked: ""Corpse or model?"") Danish magazine ""Cover"" uses anorexic model. Stirring anger in social media #dkmedier@BenjaFagerlandpic.twitter.com/w9E0yq9a49 Kruse said in a statement: ""Recently in Denmark and abroad there’s been some gloomy examples showing that problems with the beauty ideals the fashion industry creates continue to exist."" ""The stupendous amount of support being given to the Danish Fashion Ethical Charter speaks for itself; the Danish industry is aware of its responsibility and is prepared to take a collective step towards models having better well-being and towards a body image that is healthy and not sickly. We think that the fact that the industry is taking such an active part in the charter will have a much greater impact – also in the long run – than legislation issued by the authorities and fines, which have been discussed, for instance in France.” France recently introduced laws making it possible for fashion houses to be punished with fines or even jail time if they were found to be using models with a BMI of under 18. One of the core values of the Danish Ethical Fashion Charter is ""to promote and work towards healthy lifestyles as well as a healthy body ideal that reflects a healthy relationship to food, body and exercise"". We can get behind that.

"Comme des Garçons is notorious for its anti-marketing approach to the internet – in fact, Rei Kawakubo's label boasts absolutely zero online presence on social media. No Twitter, no Tumblr, nada. Until recently, the Kawakubo-founded Dover Street Market followed suit. But in the lead-up to the store's tenth anniversary, the high-concept retail space is set to launch on Instagram. Managed by AnOther Magazine editor Laura Bradley, the @doverstreetmarketlondon account is the first social media presence associated with Dover Street Market, let alone Kawakubo and Commes des Garçons. (Even the official-looking @COMMEGARCONS account is a fake, FYI.) The Instagram page launches officially in September to coincide with the 10th anniversary of the store, but it's already started teasing what's to come. The first taste? A series of images that joined up to read ""The Next 10 Years"" – the official strapline of the store's 10th anniversary celebrations. DSM also sent us this exclusive image of the iconic DSM hut, due to be premiered online on Monday (above). Other teasers included more pleasingly abstract close-ups of the hut and a quote that exemplifies the store's forward-thinking approach to fashion. It's part of a ""Future""-themed series that will run on Instagram throughout August: ""There’s a dialogue within the shop. It’s an abstract, unsaid conversation created by the brands’ very presence and energy,"" DSM president Adrian Joffe told Dazed at the opening of the Nicolas Ghesquière-curated Louis Vuitton space and window. ""When we opened, some people understood it, others didn’t. It took about four years until people started getting it and loving it."" With almost 4,000 followers signing up to follow @doverstreetmarketlondon in the last two days, we're pretty sure it won't take that long for people to get with the programme.

"“When I saw Michael Alig and the other club kids on the talk shows back in the 90s I became obsessed. I always believed I would run away to New York, but by the time I could the club kids were no more,” explains Linz Bise, the Indiana-based Instagrammer who’s using her account to chronicle the legendary era of NY’s outrageous party set. It was four years ago that Bise started @official_clubkids_and_more, initially as a way to archive the collection of photos she had on her phone. Describing herself as a “normal everyday single working mom” by day, Bise had no idea the account would be a hit. “A month or two after starting the account I had about 20 followers, and I thought that just thought ‘how cool to find 20 people with a mutual passion’. Then one night I was out for dinner for my birthday and being a respectful person I had my phone on vibrate while we ate. All of a sudden it started vibrating uncontrollably with notifications. It turned out James St. James had reposted a picture of himself. I had 2k followers in a matter of minutes and everything took off from there.” According to Bise, an @official_clubkids_and_more post must directly relate to the personalities who were part of the original underground 80s and 90s NYC scene. “I also post what they have been up to since. Sometimes there will be a post about RuPaul’s Drag Race because RuPaul was very much a big name in the scene. Other times I’ll post something tied to those club kids, for example Andrew Barret Cox because of his musical Clubland, that’s based on Party Monster.” In addition to snapshots of the era taken by the club kids themselves, you’ll see black and white photographs by John Simone that document the early scene (the likes of RuPaul, Lahoma, Goldy Loxxx, and Michael Musto) and vibrant posed photos starring Jennytalia, Whillyem, and Christopher Comp, taken by Michael Fazakerley during the latter years. For Bise, the account is as much an exploration activity, as it is a way to educate a younger era to ensure that the legacy of the club kids lives on. “I’m sharing their stories, in their words, setting the record straight in some cases, and introducing younger generations to the club kids. Most people only know what they know about club kids because of Party Monster. The movie was based on facts, but there are some things that never happened, like Michael and Gitsy never took a bath in their pee!” It’s the outlaw parties that Bise loves hearing about the most, though. “One time, over 100 club kids and club personalities unexpectedly took over a McDonald’s, a Burger King and a donut shop in full costume and caused havoc, drinking alcohol, blaring music, dancing… They pretty much treated these establishments like clubs. The cops would break it up in 15-30 mins, but the fact that they took the time to get fully dressed for 15 minutes of anarchy, attention and fun – that’s commitment to the art.” When it comes to club kid style, Bise is drawn to James St James and Richie Rich for their whimsical, childlike looks. “James dressing up as an old slice of pizza wearing an out of the box pizza costume with a grey wig, or Richie on roller skates with yarn in his hair.” She’s drawn to Goldy Loxxx and Christopher Comp, too, both of whom she now considers close friends, along with other key figures from the club kid community. “Goldy and I spend a lot of time talking about politics, and Michael and I spent the evening hanging out when he came home to Indiana,” says Bise. “One time, James and I were supposed to be in NYC at the same time, but things fell through, so he made me a video saying, “Linz I can’t believe you aren’t here. Where are you?” Let me tell you, I watch that at least once a month.”

"Last night, Maria Grazia Chiuri presented her first Dior Cruise collection on the Santa Monica Nature Preserve in Los Angeles. Guests included Charlize Theron, Solange (who also performed at the afterparty), and Rihanna, who was obviously dressed in a brand new fur coat from the collection (what else?). The open air location featured a pair of giant hot air balloons that formed the impressive background for the show. Like the alternative Hollywood sign in the distance, they were emblazoned with the words ‘Dior Sauvage’ – but as the show went on they changed, as if by prairie magic, with cave painting style artwork illustrating their surfaces. The Little House on the Prairie vibes were further echoed by the long, flowing dresses and jackets illustrated with prints inspired by Lascaux’s cave paintings, all cinched with simple, thin leather belts. The models walked in flat sandals and boots, not on a catwalk, but on the bare earth and shunned fancy hairstyles keeping it natural and tousled under hats. Not the berets like AW17, but wide-brimmed hats often underneath the chin decorated with beads, and hand-painted by Stephen Jones. Stay tuned for the full report from Susie Lau

"While Peter Lindbergh may have sadly passed away in September, he leaves a vast legacy behind. The famed photographer captured some of the biggest fashion moments and faces of his time, and, in the process, helped to redefine existing beauty ideals within the industry. Now, a number of never-before-seen images are compiled into a new coffee table book entitled Dior/Lindbergh. Shot in 2018 mostly in Times Square, the book is filled with a series of Lindbergh’s signature black and white photographs – as well as a few in technicolour – which shine a light on Dior’s 70 year-history in an entirely new way. Models including Dazed cover stars Alex Wek and Sasha Pivovarova are seen in archival pieces designed by Christian Dior himself, while others are seen wearing contemporary garments created by Maria Grazia Chiuri, John Galliano, and Raf Simons. All in all, think of it as the most luxurious and bougie street style photography project to date. “His idea was to photograph 80 ensembles, representing the history of Dior, on the streets of New York,” curator and art writer Martin Harrison writes in the book’s introduction. “This was both a masterstroke of recontextualisation and a crazy extravaganza. An unprecedented number of over a hundred priceless garments had to be removed from the Dior Museum, security-crated, and shipped to Manhattan.” The project is the latest in an extensive list of collaborations between Dior and Lindbergh. From shooting Charlize Theron for the iconic J’Adore perfume campaigns, to countless magazine editorials for the likes of Vogue and Harper’s Bazaar, Dior/Lindbergh feels like a fitting and poignant way to highlight their long-standing relationship. With each renowned for their focus on the simple elegance of women’s fashion, and their colossal impact on the worlds they inhabit, Lindbergh’s work was defined by his desire to portray women naturally and embrace their unique sensitivities – a sentiment that is felt keenly throughout the book. With photographs are as varied as the pieces they capture, the book sees models casually walking by McDonald’s in John Galliano’s AW01 collection for the house, and crossing the bustling streets of Manhattan in a black dress designed by Christian Dior in 1947. “The cycle of fashion, and of fashion photography, turns again,” Harrison concludes in his introduction, “and this unusual and edgy collection (of images) constitutes one of the rare triumphs of its recent history.” Dior/Lindbergh introduced by Martin Harrison is published by TASCHEN and available to buy here.

"Big Dick Energy probably hasn’t made its way to the dictionary yet, but when it does, the entry will consist of two words: Gillian Anderson. The undisputed hero of a TV show made for the sole purpose of confusing bisexuals over who they were most attracted to, the actor and author is an icon with a voice that makes adopting the brace position into an ASMR experience. Anderson is also a trendsetter: her Dana Scully wardrobe made me set up eBay alerts for vintage Calvin Klein suits, she rocked flower crowns long before Beyoncé, and donned Balenciaga-esque layered raincoats when Demna was but a far off twinkle in Kering’s beady eye. Appropriate, then, that she’s now launching a fashion line! A capsule collection in partnership with Winser London, a brand I have never heard of but which is indisputably my favourite, the collection features tailoring, knitwear, and a silky, silky shirt. It’s hard yet soft, masc yet femme. Remind you of anyone? In one image of the lookbook, seemingly leaked on Twitter by stans, Anderson buttons her sleeve in a way that puts The Rock, fuckboy ASOS models and manly Instagram poseurs to shame, her platinum hair coiffed to a kind of perfection that undoubtedly has Tilda Swinton shook. “I’m so thrilled to finally be able to share my new @WinserLondon capsule collection!” she posted on Twitter. “This week I’ll be highlighting a few of my pieces and sharing some design sneak peeks. I want to live in them and I hope you do too!” Yes, yes I do. The collection is available from September 1. In the meantime, please enjoy these two 1990s New York Times articles on the influential style of Dana Scully that I have bookmarked for easy reference. You’re welcome x

"You can buy a copy of our latest issue here. Taken from the spring 2018 issue of Dazed: Andre Walker is one of fashion’s most cultishly adored originals, but, into his fourth decade of intermittent, nonconsecutive design, he and his work maintain an aura of sudden invention. There is no calculated commercialism to what Andre does: not when he began his career, designing for Willi Smith’s Williwear in the 1980s, nor in his own line, which he’s shown on and off since he held his first show aged 15 in a nightclub in New York City. Perhaps this is why other designers, like Kim Jones and Marc Jacobs, have turned to him to imbue their own work with his particular sense of aesthetic clairvoyance. (In 2011, the New York Times dubbed him the real-life “fashion Zelig”.) That sense of innovation is particularly felt in Non Existent Patterns, the designer’s SS18 collection shown in October at Paris’s Musée des Arts Décoratifs. For the collection (and several more to come until the year 2020), Walker brought back patterns from looks he designed between 1982 and ’86. “They are so unlikely, so improbable – a curiosity, if you will,” says Walker of his creations’ strange power to bleed into the present. Sponsored in part by Pendleton, the show saw wool specimens undulate in folds around the body, and hand-patterned pieces worn with white poplin shirts spring forth like two-dimensional drawings puffing into bloom. By the time a parade of looks cut from Glacier National Park blankets emerged to close the show, it felt like the least pompous and most contempo show in Paris that week. The funny thing is, it was nothing but a super-chic spectre of the past. “Patricia Field let me know she had a selection of (my) archives and I went to see them,” recalls Walker. “Kim Hastreiter, Henny Garfunkel and Christiaan Houtenbos also had some pieces. I hadn’t seen this work in a long time, and it became a way to create a project for myself. I didn’t have an archive of my early work, only sketchbooks and some press. That’s why it was so mind-blowing to see the pieces and have this kind of, Oh my God, I made these things? reaction to them.” Assembling a cast of close friends, new muses and family members for this shoot was a task that came easily to Walker. “Mom would have been in this shoot too, if the schedule allowed,” he says by way of disclaimer. He was, however, able to include his sister, Sandra (pictured below). “Sandra is my perceived opposite,” he explains. “She has constantly brought our family together and has kept me mindful of such things. Coups have included bringing my dad and I back together in Paris at my Open Cubism Art Slang Lust collection at the Communist HQ in ’98, and bringing my mom and dad to Paris for my show at Petit Palais in ’99.” Just as emotion dictates Walker’s output above consumer cycles, so do the people he designs for. “I started making clothes to make my way to Paris,” Walker recalls, “but also as a way of meeting people. It dawned on me quite early that making clothes helped me communicate – as any interest does.” Paradoxically, Walker represents the ultimate fashion outsider and insider, a dichotomy that has perplexed even him. “Adrian (Joffe) and Rei (Kawakubo), Marc Jacobs, Kim Jones, Pat Field, Kim Hastreiter and Bill Cunningham have been giant influences in my life,” he says, invoking his pedigreed peers. “They know both sides of the coin. With this last collection, I feel I finally do too.” “Paulo is my life and heart, masquerading as a friend,” says Walker, issuing particularly lofty praise. “We met 30 years ago. He shares his tough love and guidance (with me) – and Tallulah, his Brussels Griffon.” Hudson, an avid yogi and sometime actor who was born in Jamaica, echoes Walker’s familial sentiment. “I met Andre in Central Park in the spring of 1986 and we became immediate friends… spiritual brothers,” he recalls. “His entire family – his mom, his late dad, and Sandra – have also become my family. Andre is an absolute genius and the most beautiful person to his core.” From their first encounter in the park, the pair struck up an instant bond, and Hudson ended up walking in Walker’s second New York show, later travelling to Paris for a runway show in 1991. “Andre’s work is super-special, and he loves to have everyday people show it.” Day-to-day, Hudson co-runs a yoga class with world-renowned tutor Yogi Charu, the proceeds of which are donated to children in need across New York. As Hudson prepares for his annual yoga retreat in Costa Rica this March, he takes a moment to reflect on ideas of reconnecting yourself to your outer appearance. “I’ve never worked in fashion, but I know that it is hard work,” he emphasises. “I would like to see people working more on their inner beauty so that the outward can be effortless… I think Andre represents that.” In an age where we all have a tendency to overamplify, there is something to be said for the impulse to wait. “I enjoy the intimacy and slowness of my writing,” says Amy Sall. The founding editor of a forthcoming platform called SUNU: Journal of African Affairs, Critical Thought and Aesthetics, Sall aims to bring new perspectives to conversations surrounding Africa and its diaspora. It’s a mission that Walker, who met Sall while she was working at the Rick Owens store in New York, is fully on board with. “Amy is someone I admire and am in awe of,” he says. “Our relationship is based on warm encounters and continual well-wishing.” “The idea (for SUNU) came from reading papers written by my peers about African issues, and thinking that these conversations shouldn’t be confined to an academic space,” says Sall. Seeing people’s reactions to archival African images posted to her social media, Sall realised the need for a greater digital space to explore topics in ways that Instagram may not be suited for. “While social media is great for sharing and discovering things, to me it is too limiting as a space to hold important conversations. I wanted to find a way (to share ideas) about Africa and the diaspora that allowed for meaningful engagement.” “Andre is totally true to himself,” continues Sall. “That’s why so many people love him and his work, and why he has such incredible longevity. I think that all artists can, and should, take a page out of his book.” Born in London, Aiden Curtiss moved to New York aged nine, not knowing where her life would end up taking her. “I never understood what a true model was until I started to work,” she says. “I was told growing up that I should try it out, as I was always the tallest in my class, but I was a bit shy and awkward.” Visiting agencies once she turned 18, Curtiss soon found herself taken with the job. “Fashion shows are beautiful to be a part of. The designers and teams have been working for months and you get to be a part of their vision. I think posing in a picture is my responsibility, to make sure the composition and my pose complement each other. Editorials push me outside my boundaries and I always leave feeling proud.” Another thing that Curtiss is proud of is her heritage. “Half-African, from Guinea”, she’s the daughter of late iconic model Katoucha Niane. But with names like Versace and London upstart Matty Bovan under her belt, Curtiss is carving her name in an industry that can sometimes place emphasis on social media over real work. Still, she doesn’t let it go to her head. “I admire models who use their platform to make a difference,” she says. “It’s important to choose a cause that resonates with you, because then you’ll fight for it.” “I don’t know her personally yet,” admits Walker of Curtiss’s part in this portfolio. “But I loved how articulate and effortlessly truthful she was when Carlos (Taylor, next page) and I drilled her about stuff.” “The great thing about collaborating with someone like Andre is that he believes in magic,” says art director Carlos Taylor. “Working with Andre is like working with your brother, on a project that the both of you used to lay in the grass and dream about doing.” The pair’s working relationship began when Taylor introduced Walker to his first backer in 1990, before the latter’s first collection in Paris the following year. But as Taylor, a former model, points out, they first met at a go-see when Walker was at Williwear. Born and raised in New York, Taylor became fixated on fashion from an early age. “I would spend my summer in the New Rochelle Public Library perusing magazine after magazine for hours and hours,” he recalls. “I would arrive around noon and close the library at eight in the evening.” Eventually, it dawned on Taylor that he wanted to create his own print venture. “I was always at the newsstands looking at the latest editions and felt that, you know, something was missing.” Eventually, this would lead Taylor and Walker to create the rare and collectible 2009 fashion bible, Tiwimuta (an acronym for This is what it made us think about), sold at the likes of Barneys and Dashwood Books. “Carlos is hands-down my favourite collaborator, friend, and a priceless source of discretion and guidance,” Walker effuses. “He has worked with me through it all… almost.” By the time she graduated from university in Paris, Céline Danhier knew she would be making films. “I love telling stories and I’ve always been interested in discovering things I didn’t know about, or seeing new perspectives. Documentary film envelops these ideas.” Danhier’s 2011 doc Blank City explored the grimy, halcyon scene of early-80s New York, when artists like Amos Poe, Lydia Lunch and Bette Gordon took art into their own hands with work that established a bohemian, anti-conventional movement under the rising shadow of the decade’s go-go Reaganism. Danhier’s appreciation for such purity of artistic purpose continues today. “I believe that there are still a lot of inexpensive ways to express creativity and collaborate with other people, ways that didn’t exist in the past,” she explains. “The internet, especially, has helped in this regard.” “We will make some moving images someday,” Walker says of Danhier, whom he refers to as his own effortless cheerleader. In recent years, Danhier has established a film collective called Bunny Lake, producing shorts, fashion films, feature documentaries and fiction narratives. “We are working on some short videos to showcase Andre’s designs,” she reveals. “Honest, creative ideas are the hope for our future as they bring in new perspectives, sustainability, and worlds we may never have imagined before.” Andre Walker describes Jeremy Lewis as “confident, a baby scholar, and a general know-it-all.” But Lewis didn’t always see himself a next-gen fashion historian. “For most of my life, I thought fashion – at least the kind I’d see on runways or parodied on TV – was boring and pointless,” says the writer and editor. “But as I got older, I started being concerned with the way that I looked, and I innately understood the power of clothes. In school, I was lucky because we had an amazing historic costume collection. So as I was discovering fashion in magazines I was also learning its history… And then I was totally obsessed.” Lewis’s semiannual journal of fashion thought, Garmento, often looks to the collections and designers that traditional media aren’t spotlighting. Renaming the project Jeremy for his next issue, Lewis will tackle the same terrain of fashion, history and obscurities, with an added focus on science-fiction and comics. “My curiosity begins when I can’t find information about a certain subject or a designer – if I discover a name or a picture that I can’t explain,” Lewis reveals. “Then I will look for primary sources, whether it’s old articles or accounts from people who are old enough to know better, and then from there I’ll build out the world and context around it. I try my best to understand what a designer or a moment meant in their time, the same way that we intuitively understand or regard a designer today. Context, context, context!” To describe Desire Moheb-Zandi as a fibre artist does a disservice to her work. Her pieces, which can extend upwards of eight feet in height, consider textile designs and applications used in clothing, rugs, or blankets and mutate them into works of hysteric sculpture. “As Anni Albers says, a sculptor deals mainly with volume, an architect with space, a painter with colour, and a weaver with tactile effects and therefore texture,” Moheb-Zandi reasons. “A characteristic of my work is my drive to create tapestries by exploring new forms. It helps me to explore new sensibilities.” This attraction to the new and inexplicable is what bonded her to Andre Walker. “We are just on the same frequency,” she explains. “It’s inspiring to work with people who can impose their own interpretations of reality where playing it safe has become the standard.” Born in Berlin to a Turkish mother and Iranian father, the artist was raised in the southern Turkish city of Adana. After attending university in Istanbul, she moved to New York, where a chance encounter at Dover Street Market brought her to the attention of Walker, who was instantly soothed by her presence. (“Perceptually, she is pure love and community,” Walker says of his friend and collaborator.) “I was mind-blown when I discovered Andre’s work,” says Moheb-Zandi. “I feel there is something deeply unique in his unaffected approach to design.

"For those expecting sexy models in skin tight clothing in this year’s Pirelli Calendar, you’ll be in for a shock. Dubbed as fashion’s NSFW calendar, Pirelli have decided to make a change this year – and quite a big one at that. In a series of sneakpeaks it’s been announced that their 2016 calendar won’t include pictures of supermodels or some of the world’s sexiest women as it’s previously done. Instead it’s traded in it’s iconic formula of nearly nude women for 13 portraits of strong women changing the world we live in. Shooting this year’s calendar is famed portrait photographer Annie Leibovitz, who recently took her modern 'Women' project on the road with pop-up exhibitions. Instead of the usual lineup of models like Gigi Hadid and Adriana Lima, who have previously graced its pages, this year’s calendar will feature Yoko Ono, Patti Smith, Serena Williams, American author Fran Lebowitz, Amy Schumer, Tavi Gevinson, Selma director Ava DuVernay, American philanthropist Agnes Gund, blockbuster producer Kathleen Kennedy, Natalia Vodianova, American businesswoman Mellody Hobson, Iranian visual artist Shirin Neshat, and Chinese actress Yao Chen. In a release, Leibovitz explained: “I started to think about the roles that women play, women who have achieved something. I wanted to make a classic set of portraits. I thought that the women should look strong but natural, and I decided to keep it a very simple exercise of shooting in the studio.” “This calendar is so completely different. It is a departure. The idea was not to have any pretense in these pictures and be very straightforward,” she added. Leibovitz’s vision for the new empowering calendar is definitely inspiring, but how will Pirelli's idea to change their winning formula of 50 plus years go down? Patti Smith told Vogue: “I have no idea what the average recipient would think, but I think that they should appreciate a bold move. We’ll see. Tavi Gevinson also told Vogue: “I feel completely unworthy, I’m honoured. I think it’s amazing to be a part of this group of women who are being celebrated for so many different things in something that’s traditionally celebrating one thing – which is also great!” Patti Smith and Annie Leibovitz have long been partners-in-crime, making it a no-brainer for the punk rocker. “It was fantastic because I’ve been shooting with Annie since the 70s, and so we’ve been through the trenches together,"" said Smith. ""I was very surprised that I was asked, and I was very proud that I was asked, and I think that Annie is doing something unique and different, and Pirelli is making a bold move. I look at Annie’s project not as a protest, but as a celebration."" Leibovitz’s choices are certainly cool and without doubt reflect top women in their fields. There are a lot of women killing it right now, so we’re sure picking the top 13 would have been difficult. Surely, Rose McGowan would have been a top contender? Or Gia Coppola? Or even FKA twigs? Who would you have picked?

"The first Monday in May is here, bringing with it 2019’s Met exhibition and accompanying Ball – which, this year, was dedicated to all things ‘Camp’. After some abysmal attempts at the theme over the past few years – remember when barely anybody wore Comme to the 2017 event? – this year saw a step up in (almost) everybody’s game. Katy Perry came as Beauty and the Beast’s Lumière, Kendall and Kylie as the Vandergelds from White Chicks, and Zendaya literally came as Cinderella (incl. leaving a glass slipper behind). Elsewhere, Cara Delevingne did this (still trying to figure it out), Ezra Miller had seven eyes, Frank Ocean did things his own way in Prada (he looks too cute to hate on), and Lizzo made her Met Ball debut looking resplendent in Marc Jacobs. In short, it was all happening. Here are just a few of those doing camp good. OK, first things first, our Lord and Saviour, the undisputed Queen of the Met Ball was not present at this year’s event. Instead, she’s currently in the UK promoting Fenty Beauty, leaving us to dream of what her take on ‘Camp’ would have been. Posting to Instagram, the singer said this year’s best dressed was Anna Wintour, but we were all rooting for you RiRi :’( As co-chair of the evening – along with Harry Styles and Serena Williams – Lady Gaga hinted that her look was going to be an OTT fantasy, stepping out before the event in a Marc Jacobs number. She didn’t disappoint, serving not one, or even two, but four looks on the red carpet. Arriving in a hot pink parachute gown, the singer’s stylist (and designer of the looks) Brandon Maxwell unzipped her dress to reveal a black one underneath. Underneath that, another hot pink dress, accessorised with oversized 80s cell phone, and underneath that, a sparkly bra and pant set accessorised with a Haus of Gaga trolley. What’s more camp than multiple look reveals? Nothing. That’s what. On his award ceremony circuit, Billy Porter proved time and time again that he’s not here to play, but to slay. Somehow upping the ante again, Porter arrived at the event carried in by six topless men. Serving ‘Old Testament Realness’, once off his throne, the Pose star showed off his entire lewk – designed by The Blonds – dripping in gold sequins and complete with wings. THIS. IS. HOW. YOU. DO. CAMP. GIRLS. Cast your minds back to Gucci’s AW18 show, in which two models took to the runway carrying their own severed heads. For his interpretation of the night’s theme, Jared Leto took a leaf out of Alessandro Michele’s book, turning up with a replica of his long-maned head. Wearing a red silk gown by the Italian house (complete with body jewellery harness), Leto’s good head game was even enjoyed by Shawn Mendes, who appeared holding it on the red carpet at one point. After making her Met Ball debut at last year’s event, Cardi B was back again this year to serve it up in Thom Browne. In a look that took 35 people over 2000 hours to create, the rapper went from wearing ‘bloody shoes’ to a ‘bloody gown’. With a sprawling train and over 30,000 feathers, if that wasn’t camp enough for you (firstly, how?!) Cardi wore $250k rubies as nipple covers. As you do. Yes, the men really struggled with theme this year (we been knew) but Kanye West seemed to have misinterpreted it entirely, turning up in Dickies. On his arm though, Kim K made all the effort, appearing cinched and dripping in jewels in the first new gown designed by Mugler in 20 years. LOUDER FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE BACK. Head to Dazed's Instagram for more from the night.

"If you’ve come across Ludovic de Saint Sernin’s designs, you’ll have noticed that sex and sexuality are common themes within his work. Since making his debut during the SS18 shows, the Paris-based designer’s signature lace-up brief has been upgraded from leather, to versions in leopard, and sparkling rhinestones for the recent AW19 offering. “Sex is part of everyone’s life and I want what I’m doing to reflect that,” the designer tells us. “The label represents a return to beauty, seen through the lens of sensuality and sex. I feel like today in our over-censored world people forgot how to be sexy and enjoy sex, but it’s really important!” With all that in mind, it’s no surprise that de Saint Sernin’s latest venture takes him away from ready-to-wear and into the world of sex toys. That’s right: the designer has teamed up with Japanese sex toy company Tenga to design a cover for its signature silicone egg. “I feel like today in our over-censored world people forgot how to be sexy and enjoy sex, but it’s really important!” – Ludovic de Saint Sernin Working with art director Matthew Mumford, the cover features the eyelets from de Saint Sernin’s signature briefs to tie the egg back to his line. “I love the final result, it’s cute and kinky at the same time,” he says. “The same way that you can unlace the eyelet briefs you can actually unlace the egg which is so cool!” To showcase the toy, the designer enlisted director Matt Lambert to create a series of shorts featuring a host of LDSS boys using the egg. In the debut film, pornstar Sean Ford – who frequently stars on de Saint Sernin’s sex account @ludovicdesaintserninx (request to follow immediately!) – appears in a bedroom setting wearing one of the designer’s crochet thongs. “I wanted this series to feel homemade – the intimacy and spontaneity of the moment celebrated through its ‘amateur’ feel,” Lambert explains to us. “Performers’ first XXX gay scenes often start with a ‘solo’ jerk-off scene which are often really uncomfortable to watch and unintentionally awkward in their voyeurism. I wanted to bring some romance to this shorthand.” “I wanted this series to feel homemade – the intimacy and spontaneity of the moment celebrated through its ‘amateur’ feel,” – Matt Lambert Narrated by Ford, his voiceover talks about self-love and masturbation, culminating with a happy ending – i.e. a cumshot. For those interested, the X-rated version will be online on PornHub. “I simply wanted to capture a moment of honest intimacy that humanised Sean and whilst provocative, while still playful,” says the director. Following the debut film with Ford, there will be additional films released, which promise to stick to the same format, only with new characters. Whatever you’re into, Lambert hopes viewers take one thing away from the films: “To feel cosy, to smile, to laugh... or to cum.” Watch the full film above.

"While it isn’t one of the fashion capitals, Los Angeles should certainly get the (unofficial) title of most forward-thinking fashion destination. After being the first city to completely ban the sale and manufacture of fur, it has been announced that it will play host to the very first Vegan Fashion Week. That’s right, VFW will take place in LA from February 1-4. “I want to ignite conversations and debates within the industry by educating, elevating and drawing connections between our most important values: our respect for human life, animal rights, and the environment,” said founder and animal rights activist Emmanuelle Rienda on why she wanted to start the event. Not just an opportunity for animal-free designers to debut their clothing on the catwalk, the event also promises to offer access to a vegan lounge that will include cruelty-free fashion, food, and beauty treatments for those attending. For those interested in visiting the first ever VFW, visit the event’s website for more details.

"At the end of last year, Nicola Formichetti announced he would be stepping down as Diesel’s artistic director, after four years at the label. Since then, company president Renzo Rosso launched Diesel Red Tag, inviting contemporary designers to collaborate and reinvent the codes of the house. Following Hood By Air’s Shayne Oliver dropping the debut collaboration in January, today Y/Project’s Glenn Martens presented his take on the Diesel codes at Milan fashion week. Launching in line with the label’s 40th anniversary, Rosso has been a fan of the Belgian designer for a while. Martens counts himself as a longtime fan too: “I’m part of the generation who grew up with Diesel,” he tells us. Bringing the conceptual thinking that he has become known for at Y/Project, Martens’ Red Tag collection reworks the pieces Diesel is most famous for. “The whole idea was to see Diesel through my eyes. Each piece is based on a classic Diesel item: the basic denims, track suits, colourful t-shirts etc.,” Martens explains. Fans of his designs need not worry though. “The rest is mine,” he says. Taking inspiration from Diesel’s “go with the flaw” campaign from last year, each of the pieces have something slightly off-kilter about them. Think jackets with buttons that twist around the body, joggers with shrunken waistbands, and extra-long jeans rolled up so they fit. “The waists are basically fit for a newborn while the rest of the fit is oversized,” the designer explains. “The sides, the front and the back are buttoned up so you need to keep your piece opened somehow to fit in the jackets. You need to embrace the mistake and own it. Make it your own.” For the collection’s lookbook, Martens enlisted Dutch artist and street photographer Hans Eijkelboom to shoot it. Known for his book People of the Twenty-First Century – which sees him shooting groups of similarly dressed people on streets around the world – this is the first time Eijkelboom has collaborated with a fashion brand. “Hans’ work connects many different types of people through one key item,” Martens says. “This is exactly core to Diesel’s brand identity. They have always been that brand that talks to everybody.” Similarly, for the presentation, Eijkelboom provided more inspiration with the set created as an homage to him. Standing on a tiered grid to represent the layout of the artist’s book, six groups of models (each four-strong) wore one of the key items of the collection. Here, the message of wearability for all was stronger than ever explains Martens. “We’re underlining that these pieces that are in theory “unwearable” are worn by the group of 24 models and therefore totally easy to wear.”

"Off-White’s Virgil Abloh is proving once again that he is one of the busiest designers in fashion. In addition to recent collaborations with Nike and the A$AP Mob, Abloh had also been rumoured to be taking over Donatella’s role as creative director at Versace (it’s not true, apparently). His latest venture is in the music industry, directing the music video for Lil Uzi Vert’s “XO Tour Llif3”. The video itself sees the rapper among zombie-type creatures with Arabic subtitles and a surprise appearance from The Weeknd. Abloh himself also appears, filming the whole thing on a handheld camera. The designer is no stranger to the world of music, working as the art director on Jay-Z’s and Kanye West’s Watch the Throne in 2011. If that wasn’t enough for you, there are more rumours surrounding Abloh that suggest he is working on a collaboration with Louis Vuitton. Whether or not it actually happens, we’ll have to wait and see. Watch the video below:

"Soon to become the subject of a Paris retrospective, designer Martin Margiela holds a hallowed position in fashion. Mysterious while he was working and totally out of sight since he stepped away from the house which bears his name, the clothes he created are not only beautiful but self-aware, inventive, and unsurprisingly, endlessly ripped off. Still, unless you’re a collector, chances are the closest you’ve come to owning an iconic piece of his archive is getting a repro from the 2012 H&M collaboration. Not so for one anonymous Instagram user. Operating under the handle @margielacollector, the mysterious account first appeared a couple of days ago, and is posting cut-out images of some pretty jaw-dropping Margiela pieces – from the fur wig hats of AW97 to the glove halter-top of SS01, printed mesh from SS89 and several of the Stockman dummy pieces which appeared for SS97. Not to mention the bring-your-own-Sellotape Tabis, duvet coats, detachable sleeves, plastic bag top and a necklace made of broken plates. Naturally, there is no information given about the items – only an email address, and the fact there’s free shipping worldwide. Our curiosity piqued, we had to find out more. Who are you? @margielacollector: (Editor’s note: this is scarification rather than white tattoo ink. @margielacollector also provided an image of the bloody wounds, but we thought this was a bit more SFW) How long have you been collecting Margiela? @margielacollector: Since my 19th birthday. Did you ever go to the shows? @margielacollector: Yes, my last show was SS09, Martin announced he was leaving the House that day. Do you collect other designers too? @margielacollector: No. Why are you selling your collection? @margielacollector: I’m exhausted, it’s overwhelming, I can’t handle it. How do we know you are for real? @margielacollector: I wish you never knew... but it’s easy, buy something. What do you think Martin’s work at Margiela represented? @margielacollector: Poetry in fashion, missing today. Do you have any favourite pieces? @margielacollector: Which pieces do you think are the most significant or historical? @margielacollector: Are you keeping any or getting rid of everything? @margielacollector: I could never get rid of everything, I need to be surrounded by some beauty in life.

"Christopher Kane has a knack for creating funny footwear. Shoes with humour. There were those heels from last season’s show with the foam still attached as if they had been freshly removed from the box, and then, of course, those bedazzled Crocs from SS17. Whether you love or loathe them, Kane wants you to know that he doesn’t really care – they’re here for good. “I’ve always been a fan of the iconic Crocs Clog. I like that they are perceived by some to be quite ‘ugly’ and not at all feminine or designed to flatter,” he said. He loves them so much that he has collaborated again with the footwear brand to create a new limited edition collection – available to buy now. Fans of the gem covered and fur-lined versions will be sad to hear that they haven’t been revived, but the good news is that there is now a new style to lust over. Inspired by the Scottish designer’s pre-fall collection, the shoes come in a variety of colours in tiger print with ostrich feather and metallic flower adornments. To finish, they are emblazoned with the brand’s signature ‘K’. The collection will not be sold again once they’re all gone, so if you didn’t get your hands on a pair before – this might be your only chance.

"Streetwear is like Pokémon – the rarer the better. The boys at new online show PAQ know this well, and now they’re back again with an episode that takes this challenge head-on – on-brand for the team behind what we dubbed last time as “Top Gear for hypebeasts.” Here, Danny, Dexter, Elias and Shaq are taking on the ultimate of all hypebeast quests – going in search of the rarest, most covetable streetwear pieces they can find. Playfully titled “Medium Rare” this episode sees the four split into two teams, going on a scavenger hunt of epic proportions – even with a trip across the pond to hype HQ (resell site Grailed) in New York. In search of a Pastelle jacket created by Kanye in the mid-00s (proto-Yeezy, if you will), Dexter stumbles across the holy grail of any fashion (let alone, streetwear) collection: an archive Raf x Peter Saville parka from the designer’s AW03 Closer collection. Meanwhile, this side of the Atlantic, Elias and Shaquille get a link-up to explore the personal, strictly not-for-sale pieces collected by UK streetwear insiders, Dukes Cupboard. Though maybe not as physically draining as their last trip up a mountain in Supreme x North Face, as the game goes on, it becomes clear the emotional stakes are just as high this time around.

"Vivienne Westwood, who recently revealed that she is supporting Jeremy Corbyn in the upcoming general election, is adding to her credentials as the coolest older-gen designer out there by vamping up her campaign against climate change and laying into Trump for his recent withdrawal from the Paris Accord – a key international agreement which asks countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Appearing on Good Morning Britain on Friday, she came flanked with a map projection which showed large parts of earth becoming uninhabitable thanks to rising temperatures, and told the presenters that she was disappointed with Trump’s actions. “It’s a terrible disaster what’s happened if Trump is going as far as this,” she said. “You know, America, the most important country in the world with the most powerful propaganda machine ever and he is stopping the clock, so that any progress made in cutting pollution is now cut back – meanwhile, he is working for the fossil fuel industry.” Other celebrities such as Leonardo DiCaprio, Arnold Schwarzenegger and JK Rowling also condemned Trump's actions, but actor George Takei, best known for his portrayal of Hikaru Sulu in Star Trek, probably had the best takedown. He tweeted: ""Trump is having the U.S. pull out of the Paris Climate Accord. Too bad someone didn't tell his father that he shoulda pulled out*, too."" Trump has been a notorious climate change denier and has signed multiple executive orders to slash environmental regulations and has pledged to dig out more fossil fuels. In 2012 he wrote on Twitter that “global warming has been proven to be a canard repeatedly over and over again"". In another post he wrote, “The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.” And in 2013, he wrote that “global warming is a total, and very expensive, hoax!” Earlier today his spokesperson, Sean Spicer, said he could not confirm whether the President still believes climate change is a hoax because he has not “had an opportunity to have that discussion”. Westwood’s campaign mirrors the sentiment of the March for Science back in April, which was a celebration of scientific prowess and a call for governments to get their ass in gear and start respecting and encouraging proper research and expertise in a political era when alternative narratives, including climate change denial, are being prioritised over fact-based analysis. Watch Westwood's interview on Good Morning Britain below. *FYI pulling out isn't always an effective birth control method. We think Trump's dad should have worn a condom.

"Last month, Hillier Bartley – the London label designed by duo Katie Hillier and Luella Bartley – revealed its dreamy SS18 campaign, shot by David Sims, with art direction by Dazed’s Jamie Andrew Reid. Before you’ve even had time to tweet ‘I need that pic on a tote bag’, the designer pair have gone and done just that. Launching today, the brand’s new capsule collection features clothing and accessories printed with images from the playful campaign. “What appeals is the idea of adding an extra layer, putting these images that play with sexual identity on casual, everyday pieces – the clash of cultures,” said the pair on the meta use of their own imagery. “In our last collection we paid homage to the work of Sarah Lucas,” the duo said, “in particular her infamous bunnies and they way they challenge gender stereotypes and play on conventions of representation. This prompted our fascination with sexual dress codes and traditional gender symbols of clothing and fabric.” From bunny bags to layered fishnets – styled in all sorts of unconventional ways – the images stay true to the spontaneous, unconventional vibe that Hillier Bartley has become known for. The collection is available now exclusively online. Read our feature on Hillier Bartley from the summer 2017 issue of Dazed here.

"For those of us who aren’t able to drop everything and jet off to the South of France in search of a simpler life a la Simon Porte Jacquemus (hi!), today brings good news. The French designer is set to throw open the doors to his very own – and obviously trop jolie – café in Paris. Following a series of posts in which he teased ‘a new project’, Jacquemus finally made a full announcement on Instagram this afternoon. Café Citron (in reference to his fave colour) is situated in the new Champs-Élysées outpost of iconic department store Galeries Lafayette, and brings a taste of the Provençal life to the heart of the French capital. Featuring simple wooden tables and chairs, lemon trees, and sun-bleached terracotta pots, the space is pretty much as Jacquemus-esque as you can imagine. The menu, which has been worked on by renowned pastry chefs Cédric Grolet, Jeffrey Cagnes, and Anthony Courtiells (among others), is similarly wholesome: think toast with homemade jam or boiled eggs, marinated Mediterranean vegetables and sardines, and rosemary and pistachio lemon tarts. There’s also likely to be a selection of French cheese and rustic home-baked bread, much like that served at his AW19 menswear show earlier this year. Citron opens on Thursday at 12pm – pack up your tiny handbag, dig out your enormous sun hat and, if you can face the hordes of iPhone-brandishing Instagrammers it’s likely (see: definitely) going to attract, head to Galeries Lafayette to check it out for yourself.

"Just a few hours before the SS20 Givenchy runway show took place tonight, the Parisian house posted, as it usually does, a series of teasers hinting at the inspiration behind the collection to its Instagram. This season, it was video clips of fingers pressing play on VHS and cassette players, as well as rifling through a stack of floppy discs (first seen making a comeback at the SS20 Prada menswear show, FYI) that featured. The message was none-too-cryptic: it didn’t take a genius to realise creative director Clare Waight Keller was throwing it back to the 90s for the new season (which is a good job, because almost of month of shows are taking their toll tbh). According to the designer, she had been inspired when looking back at a book called 90s Bitch – which delves into gender inequality and the ways in which women and girls were portrayed in the media throughout the era. To a soundtrack of Princess Nokia, models made their way out onto the runway in a series of stripped-back looks: boxy tailored blazers were paired with buttoned-up shirts, while slick leather pencil skirts were worn with tucked-in silk camis and structured bralettes. Elsewhere, twisted, sculptural tank tops were seen alongside louche, loose trousers in shades of nude, charcoal, and black. Seemingly, the city short is back too, though how ready for that we are remains to be seen. Perhaps the most surprising thing that hit the runway, though, was the deconstructed and distressed denim which offset a number of looks. Having spent a number of seasons championing a thoroughly ladylike aesthetic, Waight Keller sent out shredded jeans, cut-off denim shorts, and one distinctive panelled coat, all of which were crafted from upcycled denim. Seems like spending time with Ariana is having an effect on her.

"After NYFW ended, it was London’s time to shine – but it wasn't just inside the show venues that the best sights were to be seen. Once again, all the action outside the shows was captured by photographer Yu Fujiwara. The photographer shot a sincere Vivienne Westwood and Andreas Kronthaler outside the BFC showspace, before capturing candid images of models Adesuwa and Stella Tennant. Among his selection, too, are designers Gui Rosa, Harry Freegard, and Dazed’s editor-in-chief Isabella Burley, and as well as familiar faces, Fujiwara makes sure to display the in-between: the gremlin boots, the leopard print hair, the heavily stickered suitcases. In addition to FKA twigs and a punchy-in-pink Stefflon Don making their way between shows, Fujiwara also presents candid conversations, traffic cones, and even rubbish on the floor in his collection of images, offering up a raw, honest account of fashion week that often sits unseen amongst the glitz and glamour.

"The announcement of Riccardo Tisci’s appointment as Burberry’s new chief creative officer was something of a surprise earlier this year. But the former creative director of Givenchy expressed his approval of the move, saying in a statement: “I have an enormous respect for Burberry’s British heritage and I am excited about the potential of this exceptional brand.” Now, though, Tisci has taken the label’s highly regarded heritage and mixed it up, today unveiling a new Burberry monogram and logo. Inspired by the archives and designed by the prominent English art director/graphic designer Peter Saville – who designed record sleeves for Joy Division and New Order at Factory Records, and more recently collaborated with Paco Rabanne – the monogram is comprised of interlaced Bs and Ts (for Thomas Burberry, after the founder) in orange, white, and gold, while the logo is clean-cut, sans-serif, and modernised. The designs were premiered this morning on Burberry and Tisci’s Instagrams – along with printed emails between Tisci and Saville discussing the design process – in preparation for the designer’s first show as creative director in September.

"Virgil Abloh didn’t fail. You could tell that some people wanted him to, that they were hoping his debut collection as artistic director of Louis Vuitton menswear would be a bust. That wasn’t what happened, though – his first show was good. The atmosphere, as the sun beat down onto the rainbow runway, was incredible. The collection had a message which tied the house’s travel history with the present. The show had one of the best, most authentically diverse menswear castings I’ve ever seen on a runway – with maps on every seat detailing the birthplace of each model and of their parents. And, despite the predictions of the naysayers, it was not just a line of printed t-shirts – Abloh presented a refined collection of luxurious yet modern menswear. Not that there weren’t any t-shirts – as well as those provided as mementos for each of the guests, about a thousand of them were to be found on the backs of students, most looking to be in their late teens, who stood either side of the single row runway to watch the show. Their excitement was palpable – can you imagine being invited to a Louis Vuitton show, let alone this Louis Vuitton show, as a teenager? On the t-shirts was a photocopied image of Abloh’s new business card, with handwritten words commenting on how “surreal” it is, as well as what appeared to be his actual phone number. As we all know by now, Virgil Abloh did not take a traditional route into fashion. He did not go to CSM and work in-house at a big brand, before starting out on his own. Whatever you want to make of his relationship with Kanye, he’s a self-made phenomenon with an infamous work ethic. In an Instagram caption accompanying a picture of himself on the runway for the finale, Abloh posted five simple words, “you can do it too”, daring others to dream like he did. This is not a man who thinks fashion is for a select few – this is a man who knows what it feels like to not get into shows, to be an outsider. This is a man who, when he started showing in Paris, posted pictures of his own Off-White invitations on Instagram and encouraged members of the public to turn up. The A-Z provided on each seat with a glossary of Ablohisms began with ‘after party’, saying that it was a gathering “intended for industry guests but made great by the civilian fans of the brand in question.” “Beyond Abloh’s desire to break down walls and make this an occasion which so many could share in, it felt like an undeniable moment of recognition for the contributions to fashion that black men have made” But beyond his desire to break down walls and make this an occasion which so many could share in, this felt like an undeniable moment of recognition for the contributions to fashion that black men have made. When West and Abloh embraced on the runway in an emotional hug, it was hard not to feel affected. After the show, he posed with the rapper, Don C, and Fonz Bentley, partially recreating a semi-infamous, widely mocked image of them at Paris Fashion Week about a decade ago. The joke’s now on those who ridiculed them. For too long, luxury houses have been happy to take the money of people like the young black musicians and talents who walked in the show (Playboi Carti, Kid Cudi, A$AP Nast among them) and not speak directly to them. This show put several nails in the coffin of that ivory tower attitude. “I’ve been putting on clothes from a young age and Louis Vuitton has always been the (brand) that I’ve always looked at but it’s been so far away,” said Lash, the Londoner who opened the show. “Virgil coming into it changes it completely… it’s history and we’re part of it.” While we, as an industry, need to put in real work to undo the structural inequalities which have meant that there are so few people of colour in positions like Abloh’s, the snobbery that said that a black man from Chicago with no fashion degree didn’t deserve a seat at this table has been shown for the outdated bullshit it is. There’s still work to do, of course, but fashion is all about change. Yesterday, it changed. And that was a beautiful thing to witness.

"Although she announced her retirement from modelling in 2016, supermodel (and Kaia Gerber’s mum) Cindy Crawford has still done the odd gig in the time since. First, she walked alongside her fellow supers in Versace’s SS18 show, before she fronted Reserved’s SS18 campaign. And now, she’s the face of Acne Studios’ AW18 campaign, too. Shot by Sam Abell – whose work has been published in National Geographic countless times – at the Cadillac Ranch by Ant Farm in Amarillo, Texas, the campaign explores the idea of icons in fashion. And since rising to fame in the 80s, Crawford has definitely earned that title. When discussing the campaign, Crawford said: “At this point in my career, I’ve done just about every kind of shoot imaginable, but I was excited to have the opportunity to work with Sam Abell.” She recognised his work, but explained that she “had no idea what it would be like when he turned his lens on fashion and me!” In the campaign, she models the newly-reissued version of Acne Studios’ first-ever jeans. A part of the AW18 Blå Konst collection, the 1996 and 1997 (the men’s version) are both high waisted with five pockets and a regular fit. Crawford said, “I loved Acne Studios’ concept of bringing together an iconic photographer and an iconic location to showcase their iconic 1996 and 1997 jeans.” In-keeping with the location, the campaign is very western-inspired; with Crawford sporting cowboy boots and a hat in the majority of the images.

"Fenty x Puma by Rihanna is now in its fourth season and after debuting in New York for AW16, the resident bad gal returned to the city for SS18. Held in the Park Avenue Armoury, the space was transformed into an alienesque motocross course with mounds of pink sand dotted around the venue. Rih’s fourth collection was a mash-up of motor racing and surf wear, which meant one thing – Lycra is back. Here’s everything you need to know from the show. Before the show itself started, a gang of motorcyclists performed death-defying stunts over the pink sand dunes. Flips and tricks aside, sadly the bikers were not dressed in the new Fenty x Puma by Rihanna collection but proper protective gear. Probably for the best… While the front row at the SS18 show featured the usual fashion crowd and a few famous faces like Cardi B and Migos rapper Offset, there was one unexpected attendee in the form of Whoopi Goldberg. A fan of fashion – remember the Vetements hoodie she wore on The View? – she was dressed in an ‘F’ emblazoned sweater from the AW17 collection. Backstage after the show, the actress referred to her as a young icon. We couldn’t agree more. After all the hype that has been building up for months, there is no way that you could have possibly missed the launch of Fenty Beauty, last week. Reportedly selling out of all of its dark shades already the models in the show unsurprisingly also wore products from the line. If in doubt, follow the advice on its Instagram account – never too much gold. From the set alone, it was clear that for SS18 RiRi was thinking about the beach and bikes. The collection itself was a mashup of nylon windbreakers, tight scuba-esque gear and lycra and leather racing gear. One model even walked with a towel on his head. Remember, protection from the sun is important. For the finale, the Rihanna reminded everyone just how much of a bad gal she is by riding around the space on a motorcycle in a lime green outfit from the collection paired with over the knee leather boots. Unfortunately, Rih was only a passenger on the bike but no doubt she instructed the driver as she put it in her 2007 banger: “shut up and drive.”

"With the fast-approaching SS19 menswear shows, all those participating will be in the thick of it, finalising all the last minute details for their collections. Choosing to forgo the chaos is Emporio Armani, ditching its regular menswear offering in favour for a co-ed show on the womenswear schedule in September. It is not currently known whether or not this will be a permanent move, or just for this season but Armani is not the first Italian label to go co-ed. Both Gucci and Dsquared2 combined their collections in favour of two shows a year, on the womenswear, and menswear schedules respectively. Fans of founder and designer Giorgio Armani’s work need not worry, his eponymous label will still present its SS19 menswear collection on June 18.

"Today it’s been announced that an Alexander McQueen biopic is in the works. According to Deadline, Andrew Haigh, who directed Oscar-nominated drama 45 Years (2015), has signed on to direct the film. Damian Jones, who produced Margaret Thatcher biopic The Iron Lady (2011), will produce it along with Pathé. As for the playwright, Chris Urch will write the film, which will be based on Andrew Wilson’s biography Blood Beneath The Skin, as well as his own research. Further details – such as who will play McQueen and when this film will be released – have not been disclosed. But of course, the announcement of this film comes amid peaked interest in the designer, who committed suicide in 2010. As well as the aforementioned biography, there’s also been a play recently – entitled McQueen – which ran from August to November 2015 at London’s Theatre Royal Haymarket. Last year, the city’s Victoria & Albert Museum played host to an exhibition about the designer – Savage Beauty – which, in the 21 weeks it was open, attracted nearly 500,000 visitors, making it the museum’s most successful paid-for exhibition. However, this won’t be the first film about the designer. Louise Osmond directed a profile of the designer – McQueen and I – which explored his life, specifically his relationship with his longtime friend Isabella Blow. We reached out to the Alexander McQueen brand, who are yet to comment. Watch McQueen and I below:

"Cristóbal Balenciaga praised him as the “only one in the world who has raised dressmaking from an applied art to pure art”. Christian Dior called him the “greatest talent of my generation”, and the basis for Dior's revolutionary New Look. He’s the new subject of the Metropolitan Museum’s annual fashion exhibition, and his work is meant to inspire the celebrities who will flock to the red carpet for tonight’s Met Gala. But who, exactly, is Charles James? “To the fashion specialist, everyone knows him, but to the audience at large, he is one of those names that, because he doesn’t have a surviving label or brand, is forgotten', says Harold Koda, curator in charge at the Costume Institute. James is often cited as America’s first (and greatest) couturier, though he was actually British and was born in 1906. In the 20s, the openly gay designer moved to Chicago to escape the wrath of his homophobic father, beginning his career as a milliner to society ladies of the Windy City. As he once told a friend, he took to fashion “out of a compulsion to be involved in a business of which my father disapproved”. As he leapt from hat-making to dresses, he was championed by Diana Vreeland and dressed the crème de la crème of American high society, including Hollywood stars like Marlene Dietrich. Even other designers came running: Elsa Schiaparelli and Coco Chanel put in orders for his creations. (Coco didn’t have to pay, but Elsa did.) But James wasn’t just a dressmaker to the stars; he saw himself as an artist and a sculptor. His masterpieces were often unfathomably complex: his most iconic dress, the Clover Leaf ball gown, weighed ten pounds and used thirty pattern pieces alone. (It also looks, when viewed from above, exactly like a four-leaf clover.) A 2011 show at the Chicago History Museum resorted to CT-scan technology to explain how his dresses worked. A master manipulator, James was also combining textiles and distressing materials long before it became trendy. He mixed velvet, satin, taffeta and tulle and was a master of cut and cloth. If not for his technical wizardry, his dresses would have been unwearable – but society ladies glided across the dancefloor with ease. His persistence and dedication were the stuff made of legends: he sometimes locked his staff into the studio overnight if he thought they weren’t working hard enough. But it wasn’t just old-fashioned ball gowns and frocks: James was also an inventive visionary. His inventions included a down-filled puffer jacket (which Dali applauded as a “soft sculpture”) and an early version of the sports bra. He beat Diane von Furstenburg to the wrap dress by about four decades – the Taxi dress, held together with a few hooks, was envisioned to be so simple a woman could slip it on in the back of a cab. His talent was tempered by a foul temper and a mean streak. James once dismissed a prospective customer with the words, “I couldn’t possibly make anything for a frump like you.” Legendary photographer Cecil Beaton attended Harrow with James, and wrote in his diary: “His talent was marvellous; his wit bitter… No one could cope with his temperament for long.” Not many could cope with his prices, either. He charged astronomical prices that shocked even the most well-heeled socialite, and once spent $20,000 on perfecting the fit of a sleeve. His eye for detail was, unfortunately, not extended to his finances: in the 50s, the business sank under the weight of its debts. Not even an unexpected marriage to Nancy Lee Gregory, a rich Kansas divorcee, provided enough money to stave off the creditors. (As for the marriage, the ever sharp-tongued James commented, “all of society is double-gaited”.) By 1964, James was divorced, financially ruined and living out of a room in the Chelsea Hotel, surviving off commissions from a few loyal clients. He’d alienated his old friends and champions by picking fights and engaging in spats, including Cecil Beaton and Diana Vreeland. But, ever the social butterfly, he could still be found hanging out with Andy Warhol and chilling at Studio 54, where he once appeared in a giant sombrero. He was also planning to write a book about his experiences: Beyond Fashion, the name of the Met exhibition, takes its name from the intended name for his memoirs. He passed away of pneumonia and heart disease on 23 September 1978, with six months of rent due – but, in true Charles James style, he died keenly aware of his genius. When ambulance medics arrived the day before to check on James, he told them: “It may not mean anything to you, but I am popularly regarded as the greatest couturier in the Western world.”

"It’s been a big day at Paris Fashion Week: the menswear edition. First up, Virgil Abloh created an actual meadow filled with 30,000 carnations to showcase his SS20 Off-White collection, because fuck our debilitating hayfever! Then came Undercover, where Jun Takahashi debuted a new collab with Cindy Sherman. And of course, Y/Project, JW Anderson, and Acne Studios made up the bits in-between. Now, though, comes the one we’ve been (and are always) waiting for: RAF SIMONS. Here’s everything you need to know. ...but tbh, we’re fine with it. Tonight, the setting was a vast hall – a university testing facility – that had been fitted out with lilac carpets and industrial scaffolding, where guests including Takashi Murakami, Pierpaolo Piccioli, Romy xx, Tyler Mitchell, and living legend Laura Dern took their spots (and a series of selfies, in some cases) on corporate office chairs wrapped in (we hope recyclable!) plastic. But come on: this is a Raf Simons show we’re talking about. As guests were making their way into the venue, Willy Vanderperre was overheard noting that the building itself resembled a big pill, before the show kicked off with a voice repeating ‘Corporate America, consumer America, fascist America’ over the top of Mica Levi’s incredible, spine-tingling Under The Skin film score. As things progressed, a number of models made their way around the space wearing pieces that featured smiley face ecstasy pill motifs, ‘Stoned America’ slogans, RS-LAB logo lab coats, and heavy-duty rubber boots – making it seem like those wearing them had perhaps been busy mixing up some pharmaceuticals of their own. As seen splashed across t-shirts and tunics was a green triangle featuring the outline of a horse – the logo of Renaat Vandepapeliere and Sabine Maes’ iconic Ghent-based record label R&S Records, which played a huge part in the popularity of New Beat. The wild genre, which spawned its own devoted subculture, fused acid and techno and became huge in Belgium right around the time Raf was at uni in the late 80s. Elsewhere, the designer paid tribute to Antwerp with tailored shorts and jackets on which 'My Own Private Antwerp' was displayed. Seemingly, Raf is happy to be back in Belgium, but given the themes of the show and, more particularly, its soundtrack, his time in the US and the almost-two-years he spent at Calvin Klein are still not far from his mind. Hidden in amongst the oversized coats, rolled up trousers, knee-length tunics, and laboratory-style coats and trousers were hard-to-read and sometimes almost entirely obscured slogans that read ‘how to text your teen’, while a few models carried hats with what looked like raccoon tails attached to them – much like the ones worn by so-called American hero Davy Crockett and, later, by kids at summer camp and boy scouts. These, along with the references to pills and medication, the mention of ‘Stoned America’, and the show’s soundtrack suggest that Raf still has a few demons left to exorcise.

"What comes to mind when you think of Brazil? The sprawling, golden expanse of Copacabana beach and the wild scenes of Rio Carnival? Or, at the other end of the spectrum, the violence and gang-related crime that permeates the alleyways of its favelas? While the country is often portrayed as a place of extreme glamour and danger in the media, there is, of course, a lot more to it than that – which stylist and writer Nazanin Shahnavaz and photographer Hick Duarte set out to spotlight in their new project. Shahnavaz headed to São Paulo and befriended a group of young creatives, who she shot and interviewed with local photographer Duarte over the course of a few days in the city. Their aim was to get past the stereotypes and instead capture what it’s really like to live there. “We cast models, an actress, a DJ, and some skaters we met,” explains Shahnavaz. “We wanted to explore what it’s like to be young and creative in one of the world’s largest cities. There’s a mixing of cultures that runs deep in São Paulo, which gives it a vivid personality, and there’s a constant exchange of ideas, traditions, and aspirations that makes anything feel possible.” Taking into account the city’s growing fashion scene, the group was dressed almost entirely in emerging Brazilian labels, with the likes of Beira, Cajá, Sometimes Always, and Another Place among them. The clothes are all understated, though, and the personalities of those featured shine through. “We didn’t want it to feel contrived,” says Shahnavaz. “The clothes are always complimentary to their own personal style.” Photographer Duarte echoes Shahnavaz’s sentiment when it comes to the diversity and vibrancy of the city. “A short subway ride can take you from what feels like Beverly Hills to Detroit,” he says. “Brazil has a rich aesthetic legacy and I’m fascinated by how creatives are reinterpreting these codes in their work, and mixing them with elements of global culture. There are endless stories waiting to be told in São Paulo if you are willing to search for them.” Get to know the group below. “I’m from a beach town called Recife and I first visited São Paulo when I was 18 to walk in a show at fashion week, and I never would have comprehended the impact it would have on my life and my career. The city is one of the world capitals for fashion, music and art so I’m constantly involved with amazing projects and am always meeting new people. I’ve made some incredible friends – there’s a real sense of community, mutual love and respect. I’m a visual and multimedia artist, but instead of calling what I do art, I call it living. Since the beginning of this year I’ve lost five friends, and art is my way of keeping them alive. It’s my place of comfort, of finding peace and fulfillment. My work and way of life speaks about Afro-Presentism, the ascension of black people now, and how the disruption of stereotypes can transform the way we see each other as people. This summer, I’m heading to Atlanta to work with Messy Heads, then on September 1 I’ll be launching my first solo show at the Ghost Gallery in New York. It will be my second international show, but the first one where I will be present.” @sarmurr “I was born in São Paulo and I love the city, there’s so much to do here that it’s hard to get bored – I like to ride my bike without setting up a destination so I can constantly discover new places. It’s comforting that the city is so big and filled with so many perspectives. It frees us from those little boxes we’re supposed to fit into, but it can be exhausting living here with all the environmental problems and economic disparities. I’m most crazy about art and tattoos, and I’ve been doing them for so long that it’s hard to remember how I started – but I’ve always found it easier to communicate through visuals than words. When I’m working on a piece of art, I become totally immersed because it feels like the only thing that makes sense at that moment. I’m not used to making big plans. I like to live free of expectations but I’m full of ideas I’m excited to make happen. I just want the chance to keep evolving and exploring myself and the world.” @metanfetanini “Life in São Paulo is chaotic, but in a good way. there’s people from every region in Brazil and around the world. I moved here from Goiania, a town near Brasilia – it’s not so good, but it’s very rich in culture. I’m a hair and make-up artist, I love working with hair and beauty in all its different forms. I feel like hair is one of the most important ways to express your personality.” @lolamaria “I work with Coletivo Abebé, a collective that focuses on Afro-indigenous culture, and I do some styling, too. I recently travelled to Los Angeles to work for Yeezy. As a community manager, I work with the city to organise festivals, conferences, and parties centred around African culture. I reach out to marginalised people who don’t have access to popular-culture and strive to help other women with their self-esteem through art, music, and fashion. I’m from São Paulo and I love this city for its diversity and its gigantic art scene. I love discovering new places here, I’m always getting around. The drawback is that there are very few opportunities for people like me who don’t have a university education, but every day you keep trying to survive. It’s incredible here – we just need to work out how to dominate São Paulo. This city is ours, the streets are ours. We are São Paulo.” @th4ys “My mother is an actress and I grew up following her to rehearsals and shows. Watching her perform inspired me to become an actress, it’s what I know, understand and love. I’m originally from Rio de Janeiro and moved to São Paulo to work on a movie, and from the moment I arrived, I knew I had found my home. I’ve had some incredible opportunities and there are always fun events happening all over the city. The negative side is the extreme poverty and the homeless crisis. It’s painfully sad seeing all this misery in the streets. The inequality is clear.” @bella.carnero “I was born and raised in São Paulo. Living here is awesome, the creative scene is awesome, people here do very well in the arts. At the moment, I’m studying and I also skate. With practice anyone can get the hang of it, it’s great for your health and for your mind – for me personally, the only downside to living in São Paulo is that there’s still a bit of prejudice towards skaters. I like walking through the city’s centre finding new places to skate. It’s one of the best areas, everything you need is about a ten-minute walk and you’re guaranteed to bump into a friend. I honestly don’t know what I hope to achieve. I just want to live and be happy together with my friends. I know that whatever happens, we will be together.” “I’m originally from Uberlândia, but moved to São Paulo as an adventure and to DJ at the Paulistana nights. I’m a member of an art collective called BAIT, which began from a conversation with my brother, Adelio Fornazier, who’s also a DJ. We were looking for a way to develop an underground scene by occupying forgotten venues with a manifestation of electronic music, scenography, graphic art, fashion, and performance. I try to work on things that I love, such as techno, the collective, the street style life and visual arts. I love the community aspect of BAIT and I hope to be recognised for pioneering a new movement in the city. São Paulo is an incredible city. I knew from the moment I arrived that it would be possible to fulfill my dreams here. Every day the city offers a new experience that expands my knowledge. I like to spend time with friends drinking and listening to new music, going out to special parties, taking long walks around the city or just sitting outside in one of the squares. I hope to continue living in São Paulo, work on my personal and professional development, and find ways to keep doing what I love most.” @4nazier “I was born in São Paulo and have lived here my whole life. I’m studying to become a graphic designer, and when I graduate my goal is to work for a streetwear label like adidas or Nike SB – the kind of company where my designs can reach people. The best part of the city is the diversity. I love the people and the ways they express themselves. But there’s a lot of corruption here. People know very well what goes on behind the scenes, but nobody does anything.” “Life in São Paulo is hectic, there are so many things happening at the same time. A 24-hour city made up of people from around the world, different cultures, styles, stories...I love the diversity and the way this ‘jungle’ works. Everything is constantly in motion. At the moment I’m working with my father, we manage a store together. We opened it a few months ago and he’s relying on my management skills to make it grow. Maybe in the future I’ll go to university, but for the moment I want to set my own path – I’m still discovering who I am and what I like.” “The city has a huge variety of artists; from erudite paintings to street graffiti, and from indie bands to great techno DJs. Art is the surname of São Paulo, every aspect of the city has culture and history, and it’s easy to find good places to hang out: historic bars, huge parks like Ibirapuera, great restaurants with all kinds of food, museums, and skate parks. São Paulo is a great place, but there is certainly a downside too. We have a homelessness crisis, huge economic disparity, and we have to deal with violent assaults, theft, and drugs on a day-to-day basis. Tragic news on TV is normal.” “I live, learn, and feel life and its crazy experiences. I love music, I write and sing songs, I model, and most recently I’ve started a project with my girlfriend about women and motorcycles, documenting our adventures on the road. My heart is in being on the road, that’s my destiny. I’ll forever be in love with the feeling of freedom. São Paulo is a giant. I like giants: they’re great and powerful, but at the same time, they’re just too big for certain things in life. That’s why I often ‘escape’ from São Paulo and just go to nature. The creative scene here is getting more and more diversified and free lately, thanks to all the young minds who are ready to fight the world. I just love the Brazilian way, the essence.” @zyomra

"After eleven years leading Dior Homme, Belgian designer Kris Van Assche is leaving the house. “It is with great emotion that I thank my team, my studio and the ateliers,” the designer said in a statement released today. “Their support and their unique talent and ‘savoir-faire’ have made all my creations possible.ˮ During his tenure, Van Assche was known for his sleek tailored silhouettes, mixed with nodes to various youth subcultures. At his last show, themed ‘forever young’, Van Assche continued to throwback to the 90s, in a collection that featured tribal prints worn by a handful of older models as well as the usual young faces. In line with his interest in music – particularly from the 80s – his campaigns over the years have starred musical talents like Boy George, The Pet Shop Boys, and Depeche Mode’s Dave Gahan. Newer names like A$AP Rocky and The xx’s Oliver Sim also featured alongside actors like Robert Pattinson, Rami Malek, and Lucas Hedges. Director Larry Clark was both campaign star and collaborator, filming a group of young skaters in Dior Homme back in 2016. It’s not yet known where he’s headed, but Dior has reported that Van Assche’s next move will be announced shortly, and that he will continue to work within the LVMH group. WWD has now reported that Kim Jones – who recently left Louis Vuitton after seven years – will take over Van Assche in the role. “I am deeply honoured to join the house of Dior, a symbol of the ultimate elegance,” Jones said. “I am committed to create a modern and innovative male silhouette built upon the unique legacy of the house.” Jones will present his first collection for the house at the SS19 shows in June. Watch Van Assche’s final collection for Dior Homme below:

"Fendi has spent 17 months – and a whopping £1.4 million – restoring Rome’s iconic Trevi Fountain, which was reopened in November of last year. Last night the fountain gave something back, kind of, to the house that has invested so much in it. The 16th-century construction played host to Fendi’s AW16 haute fourrure (the fur equivalent of haute couture) show which was staged, not around the fountain, but actually on top of it. In something akin to an America’s Next Top Model challenge, models walked down a glass runway that stretched over the water. (Needless to say, none slipped and fell into the water like this.) The show saw big-time social media girls Kendall Jenner and Bella Hadid take to the catwalk, along with current Dazed cover star Yasmin Wijnaldum and more of our favourites including Ruth Bell, Molly Bair and Lineisy Montero. Obviously couture (or in this case, fourrure) is a branch of fashion reserved for a certain elite – and this is something that creative director Karl Lagerfeld embraced, instead of shying away from. “I called the show Legends and Fairy Tales,” he said in an interview with Vogue, “because it’s a collection that doesn’t relate to everybody like ready-to-wear, this is very special for people who have a special kind of life.” The collection itself paid testament to the extraordinary skill of the petites mains working in Fendi’s fur ateliers. One coat made from Persian lamb was hand-punctured with over 5,000 holes, so that it looked like lace. Some looks were constructed, like a jigsaw, from tiny pieces of mink while others were decorated from delicate floral appliqués, also made from mink. “This is what Fendi is all about,” said Lagerfeld after the show, “No other fur house in the world does it, or could do it.” While fur remains a divisive topic (several protesters turned up at the show), it’s hard to deny Fendi’s craftsmanship when it comes to the material which is, ultimately, unparalleled.

"It seems Rihanna has been feeling collegiate of late. Fresh from going to Harvard to accept her ‘Humanitarian of the Year’ honour, the singer took over La Bibliothèque Nationale de France (that’s the French National Library, by the way) last night for the third installment of her Fenty x Puma collaboration. Redecorating it with lockers and flags, it felt kind of like the school of your All-American dreams; where the setting was extravagant and everyone was really, really ridiculously good looking (obviously). Opening with an omniscient voice asking the audience to open their books, only to segway into Radiohead’s “Creep” before kicking it up a notch with Die Antwoord’s “Happy Go Sucky Fucky” – this was clearly Rih’s kind of school, not the one your parents wanted you to go to. That is, one where the desks became runways, and the likes of Cara Delevigne and rapper, Future were in attendance. (If it appeases the ’rents, there was a Keats poem in there amongst the thumping bass at one point.) Walking the desk/runways were none other than top models Joan Smalls, Stella Maxwell, and Jamie Bochert. That’s not all – the stellar cast also featured gap-toothed, shaven-headed beauty Slick Woods, who opened, and Hanne Gaby Odiele who, in a particularly punk moment, literally tore up a book as she took to the stage. It was a visual metaphor for what was going on with the clothes: preppy plaid got an edge printed on floor-length puffa coats, pleated skirts were cut and spliced into asymmetric short hybrids, and tops came cropped for maximum underboob flashing, or were just not there at all. Badly behaved school girls indeed. Familiar letterman motifs were recontextualized, and Rih even managed to turn American football boots into sexy thigh-highs (I mean, if anyone could, it would be her). But no high school would be complete without teenage alienation – enter the goths, who starred in black on black looks, topped off with neon hair. Nearly everything was branded with the Fenty crest, and at times topped off with cute-kitsch bear backpacks. Finally, headmistress Rih took her bow in a furry lime green coat, and paper flew down from the rafters like every school’s out scene you’ve seen on film. Consider the Fenty class of 2017 in session.

"Simon Porte Jacquemus’ SS16 show opened not with a model, but with the young designer’s 10-year-old cousin pushing a large red ball of fabric across the show space. The designer himself subsequently emerged dressed all in white leading a similarly white horse by the reins – one the season’s most theatrical moments. The Jacquemus AW16 campaign also features children – in a sense. The images comprise of childhood pictures of the designer and his muses – model Philippine Chaumont and DJ Clara 3000 – superimposed against primary-coloured backgrounds. “This season the designer chose not to show clothes but to translate his creative vision using innocent shots of friends as kids,” said the brand – who are making a surprising move by revealing the campaign before the show has even happened. The unveiling comes just weeks before the designer is scheduled to present his AW16 womenswear collection at Paris Fashion Week. Stay tuned for coverage of the show.

"OK, who saw this coming? After making her fashion world debut as a guest at Chanel’s New York Métiers d’Art show back in March, actress and celebrity daughter Lily-Rose Depp has scored her first campaign for the house. Shot by Karl Lagerfeld, the 16-year-old is the new face of the label’s eyewear, posing in circular, pearl-decorated frames. Depp follows in the footsteps of other Chanel celebrity muses including Kristen Stewart, Lily Allen and her own mother, Vanessa Paradis, who has been modelling for the brand for decades. “Lily-Rose is stunning, she's a young girl from a new generation with all the qualities of a star,” said Lagerfeld of his new muse. The campaign comes just days after Depp was spotted sitting down at a table in the Chanel casino, the elaborate Monte Carlo style set created by the house for their AW15 couture show. The actress was seen playing cards alongside the likes of Julianne Moore, Lara Stone and Isabelle Huppert, appearing arm in arm with fellow famous offspring Lily Collins. Depp also recently appeared in a new video for Irish rapper Rejjie Snow, and will make her first major debut opposite her father Johnny in a comedy horror called Yoga Hosers later this year.

"In case you missed it, Alexander Wang recently announced that he’s reissuing ten pieces from his archives in celebration of his brand’s tenth brithday. As for which items get reissued, Wang is doing things democratically, opening it up to the public – and as shown by the designer’s recent Instagram posts, you’ve still got time to cast your vote. Whether you fancy the glitter drainpipe jeans from AW11, the lace-up corset sweatshirt from SS10 or the bra cup dress from AW09, you can head over to the designer’s website to make your pick. The top ten most-voted-for pieces will form a capsule collection that will be available in-store and online from September. It’s been a decade since the now 31-year-old Wang made his New York Fashion Week debut. The designer has since become known for his signature “model-off-duty” style and sporty, activewear aesthetic, which has won him fans among critics and, as indicated by the designer’s estimated $70 million net worth, hordes of customers. The brand's anniversary project comes in the wake of the its heavy metal inspired AW15 show and sports luxe collection for H&M, but also amid mounting speculation that its founder is leaving Balenciaga, where he has held the position of creative director for the last two and a half years. According to WWD, the Nicholas Ghesquière successor will still preparing his SS16 collection for Balenciaga for Paris Fashion Week this September – but the house could be facing a change in leadership.

"Since Liu Wen's cryptic Instagram post about the Apple Watch, rumours have swirled that the Chinese model would be the new face of the gadget. Turns out all the speculation was right: Liu Wen is on the latest cover of Vogue China, accessorising a Céline dress with Apple's latest. The magazine cover, shot by David Sims and styled by Karl Templer, marks the big fashion debut of the Apple Watch. The gadget won't even be out until early 2015. ""As the very first fashion publication to feature the recently launched Apple Watch on its cover, Vogue China is following in the Vogue tradition of moving with the times, giving our readers the first glimpse of a pioneering piece of technology that also doubles as a highly covetable fashion accessory,"" editorial director Angelica Cheung told the Telegraph. ""In its slick marriage of technology, fashion and lifestyle, the Apple Watch will have a significant impact on the way we live."" Apple has been schmoozing the fashion industry since it announced the watch. During New York Fashion Week, it invited fashion editors and style bloggers to its launch in Cupertino, California; at Paris Fashion Week, it also organised a demonstration during Colette for high-profile guests including Karl Lagerfeld and Anna Wintour. Liu Wen was there to try it on, writing on Instagram: ""My second meeting with the #AppleWatch, this time in @colette! The first time? Well, you'll see soon."" Later that day, Azzedine Alaïa, Apple vice-president of design Jonathan Ive and industrial designer Marc Newson hosted an exclusive dinner for members of the fashion elite, with the Apple Watch taking front and centre spot in Alaïa's showroom. Needless to say, luxury is at the heart of Apple's marketing strategy for the watch. And why not? Given that early estimates put the cost of its more high-end end models somewhere in the region of $1,999 and $5,000, you'd have to be pretty damn rich to afford one.

"It’s lurid, it’s bloody, it passes the Bechdel test with flying colours. Dario Argento’s giallo horror Suspiria is an undisputed classic of the genre. With mysterious goings-on (and a couple of sudden, very cinematic deaths) at a German ballet school, an American student is faced with unravelling the truth of the supernatural forces at play. The resulting film is 100 minutes of dizzying vivid colour, suspense, and a soundtrack so intense you’ll hear it in your dreams. The clothes in the film speak to its exploration of femininity – heroine Suzy is all semi-sheer layers and white ruffles, there’s the vampish Olga, who paints her nails a shocking red; the brilliantly butch and tightly-laced teacher Miss Tanner; the dusty, pastel glamour of Madame Blanc – who you sense has more darkness to her than her saccharine cocktail dresses might suggest. It’s no surprise, really, that the world of fashion has looked to it for inspiration. Suspiria is to be reimagined next year by Call Me By Your Name director Luca Guadagnino (and starring Dakota Johnson, Chloë Grace Moretz, Mia Goth and Tilda Swinton, and with a score by Thom Yorke (!). To tide you over until then, though, it opens today at the Barbican, in specially restored 4k. In anticipation, here are four times the runways referenced Suspiria. A lover of films (with another fav being ridiculously fashionable vampire flick The Hunger) Nicolas Ghesquière posted screenshots from Suspiria as a prelude to his SS15 show. “Argento was a B-movie director who wasn’t considered a great at the time,” the Louis Vuitton creative director told us in our Winter 2015 issue. “He cared so much about the construction and details of his films – like the blood that is so red you can’t quite believe it’s blood.” The collection itself did indeed have a somewhat 70s feel, with a violently red, shiny, eel-skin dress, and trippy psychedelic floral prints not unlike the famous wallpaper that appears in the film. Thomas Tait is perhaps the designer whose Suspiria obsession was most obvious on the runway. For AW15, everything from the invite to the clothes got Argento-ified – a famous still from the dazzling death scene which opens the film was the dominant reference point. Actually though, it was pretty low-fi – taken from a screengrab he made on his laptop when watching it in bed. “I thought it would be really interesting to make these highly intricate garments and undercut them with a crap image from the film I love,” he told us backstage. The California-born Rodarte designers are certified movie buffs: they even made one of their own, featuring Kirsten Dunst as a ‘cannabis dealer mired in grief and delusion’. Back in AW08, they took reference from Argento for a collection inspired by Japanese horror and ballet (amazing combo), and years later returned to the film to borrow the soundtrack, this time using it for their darkly romantic AW16 show. If that wasn’t enough, they even put on a screening once for LA org Cinefamily’s women-curated weekender. “This season I was listening to the soundtrack of Suspiria, the ’60s Italian horror movie that went on to win an Oscar. It’s a beautiful soundtrack by the Italian band Goblin,” Joseph Altuzarra told T back in 2012. While he wasn’t quite on the money with the facts (70s not 60s, and no Oscar) we can forgive him for his on-point assessment of Goblin’s soundtrack. A skin-tingling synth fantasia, its crescendoing chants make it one of cinema’s most memorable. It took him a couple of years to actually use it in a show, but it accompanied his 70s-tinged SS15 collection down the NYFW runway.

"The ardent Gucci fans out there may remember that in December, the house previewed its pre-AW16 collection on Snapchat. The preview consisted of a short video taken behind the scenes of a photoshoot with cult photographer Ari Marcopoulos. Now, five months later, we know what this shoot was all about: a book entitled Epiphany. Hailing from Holland, Marcopoulos moved to New York in 1980 where became one of the most crucial documentarians of American culture, capturing those on the fringes – from artist and musicians to skateboarders and snowboarders. His subjects include Jean-Michel Basquiat, the Beastie Boys, New York hip hop group Ratking and Californian hardcore punk band Trash Talk. For this project, the subject was Gucci’s pre-AW16 women’s and men’s collections designed by Alessandro Michele. “For seven days we photographed Alessandro’s collection,” says Marcopoulos in a statement, explaining the process. “As the days went on our surroundings made me feel equally in Roman times of the past and solidly in the present and future. Above all, we were having a good time which would have pleased Dionysus.” Marcopoulos is the latest in a series of outsider creators that Michele has enlisted to contribute to his vision for Gucci. From photographer and filmmaker Matt Lambert, to photographer and model Petra Collins, graffiti artist GucciGhost and, most recently, Cocteau Twins who soundtracked his pre-AW16 campaign film. Epiphany, which is being published by fashion’s favourite publishers IDEA, will be released a limited edition of 1,000 copies and be launched on May 5 at Dover Street Market in New York.

"There’s a lot going on in the world of Palace Skateboards right now. In the last month alone, its had an exhibition at the ICA, dropped an Alasdair McLellan photobook, and released a viral commercial starring Jonah Hill for its latest Reebok collab. Next up? A magazine, which the brand just announced on its Instagram. The mag stars Palace Wayward Boys Choir skater Lucien Clarke on the cover, and comes complete with a typically on-brand bullet point description (•HI-GRADE DUMB CAPTIONS♻️ •ZERO STINKY DEODORANT ADVERTS♻️). It’s completely photographed by photographer Mike O’Meally, who has been shooting skateboarders for over 20 years. Its clothes may have garnered an unreal amount of momentum in the last couple of years, but as this latest project shows, Palace is a skate brand before it’s a fashion brand. The magazine will be available later on this week – in the meantime, you can pick up its photobook here, and check out the hilarious Jonah Hill ad below. As founder Lev Tanju said of the inspiration behind it, “We just wanted to make something really stupid”... @palaceskateboards

"For their AW16 campaign, Miu Miu travels to Houghton Hall in Norfolk for a modern take on historic high-society with a series of images taken by esteemed photographer Alasdair McLellan, and styled by LOVE magazine’s editor-in-chief Katie Grand. Having recently released his second book, “Ceremony”, earlier this year, here McLellan trains his lens on former Mean Girl, Amanda Seyfried. The actress stars alongside models Anna Ewers and Taylor Hill in a collage of images depicting ‘Found Narratives’, with prim tea maids, croquet and country gardens forming these layered stories. The collection itself brimmed with pearls, frills and argyle knits, fit for the coquettish characters of the season’s campaign: The Player, The Ingénue and The Whisperer.

"All eyes are on Gosha Rubchinskiy once again. Or, more specifically, his AW17 collection, which has just been released as a lookbook available to buy over at Dover Street Market in July. While we know it’s hard to get that brand new Burberry collab out of your mind, cast your mind back to January, when Gosha revealed the AW17 collection in Kaliningrad, Russia. As well as featuring berets designed by Stephen Jones and continuation of the designer’s experimentation with tailoring, it was heavy with sportswear (thanks to a collaboration with adidas football celebrating the 2018 World Cup). Speaking about the collection at the time, Rubchinskiy said, “Now things are changing, you see skate kids wearing football clothes and you can see football fans wearing skate stuff. Cultures mix, subcultures mix.” That mix of skate and sportswear is something that Russian designer has become known for and continues to explore with his collections. Continuing the relationship with the German sportswear brand (a partnership that is set for the long run), adidas appeared again in the SS18 collection shown last week in Saint Petersburg. This time the inspiration came from 90s rave culture in the Russian city and pieces from the collab came in the form of football shorts, jerseys and neon tracksuits. While you wait for next season’s goods to drop, consider your wishlist for this season sorted. Check out the gallery above for more from the lookbook, and head to Dover Street Market for more

"Watch out, Pitti Uomo – Jeremy Scott is coming for you. Moschino will be making its Italian menswear debut this June at the international trade show in Florence. Organisers invited Scott to be menswear guest designer, praising his larger-than-life take on the Milanese brand. It will be the first Moschino men's runway show in its native Italy since Scott took the reins as creative director. ""In Jeremy Scott’s collections, we see the humor, the irreverence, the tendency to explode myths, and the manipulation of pop iconography – all that we knew to be part of Franco Moschino’s spirit and designs,"" said Raffaello Napoleone, chief executive officer of Pitti Immagine. ""There is also lots of originality in his work – he seems to have a sort of special-sensor focused on our times – in the way he combines fabrics and materials, especially the finest types, because his designs are luxurious,"" Napoleone added. ""And that is the reason behind our invitation."" Canadian designer Thomas Tait will also be presenting a runway show as Pitti's women's guest designer. The award-winning designer, who was famously the youngest-ever Central Saint Martins MA graduate at 22, has been turning heads for his ultra-tailored, conceptual take on ""unsexy sexiness"" in womenswear. ""Over the past few seasons, Thomas Tait's women's showings at London's fashion week have become not-to-be-missed events,"" says Lapo Cianchi, director of communications and events at Pitti Immagine. ""We like his coherence, sartorial skills, unexpected shapes and dry devotion to design. He is never afraid to experiment and push the envelope."" ""That is why we thought of offering him the opportunity to express his creativity here in Florence with an unusual – unusual for him, that is – project, that we could call 'reflections on his work', with the 'help' of special places in the city."" You'll have to wait until June to see what Scott and Tait have in store for Pitti Uomo – but if it's anything like Hood By Air's pagan-infused offering in a fortress-like villa, expect something truly spectacular.

"What does the advancement of AI mean for the future of the arts, music, and fashion? Will robots come for our creative industries? Could a machine ever dream like a human can? This week on Dazed, with our new campaign AGE OF AI, we’re aiming to find out. If you’ve kept up with the “career” of robot Instagram It-girl Lil Miquela, you may have noticed that weaved into her life story are two other (less well-followed) characters, Blawko and Bermuda. Both Blawko and Bermuda support Miquela’s soap opera story with their own personas – Blawko is a streetwear kid with face tattoos and an acerbic tone of voice on social media, Bermuda is a conventionally attractive white girl who harbours ambitions to be “the most famous robot in the world”. Blawko and Bermuda are in an on-off relationship, one which Miquela often gets stuck in the middle of – just the other day Miquela posted that she “had to go back to LA”, as Blawko and Bermuda had got in a fight, but told her followers that she “don’t wanna go into details”. But like any high-profile Instagrammers in love, Blawko and Bermuda regularly make up with posts of themselves enjoying life, and all the right motivational hashtags. Recently, as did a lot of humans, Blawko started vlogging on IGTV, with a review of Nicki Minaj’s new album. It’s uncanny viewing, one that captures a general nihilism you often find on Instagram, often as compelling as watching a human, while throwing up eerie slash hilarious glitches. We reached out to his creators Brud – who declined the opportunity to shed light on how Blawko’s speech is developed and delivered, although Blawko himself alludes to his POV being created by “running all of Twitter through a processor” – to ask Blawko to review some looks for Dazed. Here he is giving the lowdown on some fits. As Blawko says, “them some fuckin’ clothes”. Watch the video below.

"Last week, we brought you the news that Chloë Sevigny was selling archival pieces from her extensive wardrobe in New York, alongside stylist and Dazed contributor Haley Wollens and vintage collector Gabriel Held. Originally set to run across the weekend, by the end of the first day everything had sold out – meaning a lot of people likely went home v disappointed. Now, though, another cult style icon has announced she will throw open the doors to what we can only assume is a walk-in closet of epic proportions, selling a selection of what she finds inside on luxury resale site Heroine. Said style icon? The one and only: Courtney Love. Among the items hitting Heroine’s digital shelves is a corseted black cocktail dress by Vivienne Westwood, a velvet jumpsuit by Rick Owens, a pale pink silk Galliano gown, and the pin-striped tailored jacket she wore as part of Saint Laurent’s 2013 campaign – as shot by Hedi Slimane. Also featured on the line-up are pieces by Marc Jacobs, which is pretty lols when you consider the fact Love and husband Kurt Cobain set fire to the designer’s grunge-inspired collection for Perry Ellis, when the designer sent it to them as a gift back in 1992. “I love fashion and I love sharing with others, so, while I certainly hold some pieces more dearly than others, I will not grasp tightly to material possessions” – Courtney Love “I love fashion and I love sharing with others, so, while I certainly hold some pieces more dearly than others, I will not grasp tightly to material possessions,” explains Love of her decision to clean out her closet. “When it’s time to pass something along, I will do that with pleasure, as I believe that clothing should be worn or displayed in a way that allows its beauty to be seen.” And, dear reader, where better for that beauty to be seen than on your very own body? Not only will you be helping Love make space for more red hot runway looks, and updating your wardrobe with some serious fashion history in the process, you’ll also be contributing to a great cause. Stand for Courage, which was founded by Love’s sister Nicole Jon Sievers, is a non-profit organisation which aims to change the conversation surrounding bullying, and the place a portion of the proceeds raised from the sale will go. The Heroine x Courtney Love closet sale launches on December 6.

"Nepalese designer Prabal Gurung is calling on the world to donate money to help those affected by the 7.9 magnitude earthquake which has devastated his home country. With the help of CrowdRise, the designer is raising relief funds through his charity, Shikshya Foundation Nepal. He wants to hit $500,000. So far, he's raised half that amount, with the CFDA donating $10,000. Born in Singapore, Gurung was raised in Nepal's capital, Kathmandu. He moved to New York in 1999 to pursue his fashion career, but Nepal remains close to his heart, particularly during a time of such severe adversity. Gurung describes Nepal as ""a constant source of inspiration""; his family still lives there. In one interview with the Wall Street Journal, an exhausted Gurung told of his concern for loved ones in the aftermath of the disaster and the pain of ""sitting here when your family’s out there and you feel so helpless"". “There will be another crunchtime in a week or two, when the attention of the world moves on: that’s when Nepal will really need help,” he told the New York Times. “Especially in the small villages that at the moment are almost inaccessible.” He added that members of his family, including his parents, are sleeping outside their houses ""because of fear of aftershocks"". The official death toll stands at around 5,000, but is likely to increase once rescue teams gain access to more remote areas of the country. Many Nepalese people are also sleeping outside, with food and water in short supply. Gurung says he just wants to help. ""My thing was just to make sure people are aware of it. There’s been a tremendous, tremendous reaction from everyone.” You can donate here.

"After months of waiting to find out what Puma and Rihanna have been up to, the sportswear company has finally revealed what their new creative director has been up to. So here you go: the first ever campaign from BadGalRiri. On Tuesday Puma posted a pic of their latest campaign ad on Instagram, which featured Riri posing in a crop top, leggings and a pair of Pulse XT sneakers. It hasn’t been confirmed whether the outfit Riri is sporting is part of Puma’s new collection or whether these are her designs, but going by the caption on the post it’s all about the sneaker. The caption reads, “An icon who does it all needs a shoe that can keep up. Introducing the Pulse XT, worn by Rihanna.” For those who love the sneakers, they are already available in different colours online at Puma.com in both mens and womens. Puma tapped Rihanna as creative director back in December for a reported sum of over $1 million, but details about her appointment have been thin on the ground since. Admittedly the new black and white ad is pretty sleek, but not very Robyn ""Bitch Better Have My Money"" Fenty. Hopefully, she'll start batting out some of her own designs very soon.

"There are no more ‘cool kids’ in the streets of Harajuku. At least, that’s the reason cited by founder Shoichi Aoki as to why cult Japanese street style magazine FRUiTS has called it a day after 20 years of documenting the area’s most experimental fashion. Since the mid-90s, the publication has brought Japanese youth culture and style tribes to the masses, one carefully credited portrait at a time. Not just one of the first platforms to show the world kawaii, gothic lolita, and cyberpunk styles as the happened on the street (before they were hijacked by the likes of Gwen Stefani and Avril Lavigne), FRUiTS defined street style as we know it today. Now, no fashion week coverage is complete without those images, and the line between the street and high fashion is barely perceptible. But FRUiTS was always meant to be the antithesis to this kind of posturing, and Aoki’s decision to stop printing the issues seems based on this lack of authenticity: “There are no more fashionable kids to photograph,” he claims – not like during the heady DIY days when he first started taking pictures of the people on the streets of his Harajuku home. To the man who told Dazed he sees “fashion (as) a kind of ability,” this ability, it seems, is now lacking. All hope is not lost, though – while the print issues may be no more (the last having been published in December last year), Aoki previously expressed to us that he’s optimistic about FRUiTS’ digital presence: “There is potential to create a different, equally special thing online,” he said. “I’d like to donate the entire archive to fashion institutes or groups around the world for preservation and use. I think I might be the only person who has an archive of 80s London and Paris along with 90s Harajuku, so it’s my duty to make it public.” Read our longread feature with Aoki here.

"Initial reaction: Folkloric myths and golden girls Unexpected details: Fine gold pleats which, by the final looks, grew into blossoming flower-like appliqués unfolding from the shoulder and hip. Stand out looks: Woven threads falling from a kimono jacket, and the incredibly sculptural gold and black ruffled appliqué that appeared towards the end. Progression: Barbed wire, oriental floral and gold baroque prints developed from the surface into frills at the seams and 3D embroidery. Atmosphere: A gold backlit screen, in geometric folds stretched across the entire runway, illuminating the show space and emulating the golden pleats in the collection. Location: An industrial warehouse in the heart of Paris – the same space Dries takes over four times a year. Live performance: Every season Dries presents us with a mystery performer, and leaves show goers to figure out who they are. For SS14, it was Colin Greenwood, bassist for Radiohead. Cue smug tweets from those in the know. Invitation: Thin and very delicate gold foil invitation. Beauty: Gold glitter eyelids and a thin gold line painted into the hair parting.

"In February, pop phenomenon Rihanna made her fashion week design debut with her Fenty x Puma show. As a second collection didn’t appear at this season’s just-gone New York Fashion Week, it was unknown as to whether there would be a follow-up. However, it’s been announced that the singer-slash-designer will be staging her second show at Paris Fashion Week in just eight days time, confirming rumours reported by WWD in August. A live stream will be available for all to watch on Tidal, including non-members, at 6.30pm and 7.30pm BST. As for what we can expect – not much is known, other than that the show will be more intimate than her first and will be veering away from the traditional runway format. With a move from New York to Paris, this could possibly allude to more changes from the brand. “It’s a dream for me to be able to present my second collection of Fenty Puma by Rihanna in Paris,” she told Vogue. “I approached this season very differently and felt the theme and concept was best suited for one of my favorite cities, Paris.” The last AW16 Fenty x Puma collection showed Rihanna’s take on gothic, Japanese-inspired subversive streetwear. In addition to designing a collection, Rihanna has also been the main star of the campaigns, and her first shoe collaboration with Puma sold out in three hours. You can check out her first campaign for Puma here.

"Today, everyone‘s favourite Parisian boutique colette shocked us all by announcing that it will close this December. We are obviously still trying to process. “As all good things must come to an end, after twenty wonderful years, colette should be closing its doors on December 20th of this year,” the boutique said on its Instagram. The statement goes on to explain that Colette Roussaux, co-founder of the store, is ready to retire – of course, “colette cannot exist without Colette.” At the boutique’s 20th anniversary in March, Roussaux’s daughter Sarah Andelman – creative director, purchasing manager, and another all-round genius – responded to speculation about the future of colette, “Every year, people ask us how long we plan to go on. We are always searching for newness, discovering new designers and launching new talents, so there is no reason to give up. If suddenly there were nothing interesting left anywhere, we would reconsider, but fortunately something cool comes along every day.” Dazed has a lot of fond memories of the boutique over the 20 years it has been a fashion landmark (we even launched some special edition t-shirts there), and like many others will be sad to see it go. According to the statement, negotiations are under way with Saint Laurent to take over the space. So it will be in safe hands. Thankfully, until closing day, Colette will continue to renew itself each week with the most desirable products in fashion, music and art. So don’t waste another minute and get shopping before it closes.

"Puma has just announced that Rihanna is its new creative director. The CFDA Fashion Icon winner will be taking the reins of the sportswear brand's womenswear collection as part of a multi-year contract. BadGalRiri, you done good. WWD reports that Rihanna flew into Puma HQ in Herzogenaurach, Germany on Monday for her first meeting with the brand's design team. The singer was there to lay down the law on the line's direction as well as pick out new colours and styles. Riri announced the news on her Instagram, writing: ""Hello #PUMA"" from Germany and posting pictures of herself in an all-white ensemble that included the brand's signature white trainers: The company says that Rihanna will ""will work with Puma to design and customize classic Puma styles as well as create new styles to add to the Puma product portfolio"". She will also join footballer Mario Balotelli and Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt as a global brand ambassador for the company's AW15 campaign. “Signing Rihanna is a fantastic step for Puma,” said Puma CEO Bjørn Gulden. “Her global profile, her charisma and individuality, her ambition – all these things make her a perfect ambassador for our brand. With a strong portfolio in football, running and motorsport, finding an inspiring partner for women’s training was very important. Rihanna was a natural choice for us. We’re delighted to have her as a partner, and we’re looking forward to what’s to come.” So how much is Riri's contract worth? Before the deal was inked, a source told NY Daily News that Puma is paying Rihanna just over $1 million. The signing is part of Puma's push to transform the performance sports brand into a lifestyle brand. Rihanna is the second musician Puma has enlisted in its big push. It hired Solange as an art director in February, releasing two collections of technicolour sneakers that the True singer designed in collaboration with artists and designers like Gerlan Marcel of Gerlan Jeans.

"On Tuesday morning, the fashion industry was hit with the tragic news of Karl Lagerfeld’s death. While fashion remained at the forefront of his five-decade career, the German designer also frequently expressed his passion for photography. Now, just three days after his death, Galerie Gmurzynska has managed to compile over 20 years of Lagerfeld’s work into a retrospective-style exhibition, which opened yesterday in Zurich. Entitled Homage to Karl Lagerfeld, 30 Years of Exhibitions, the exhibition will showcase everything from his celebrity portraits of the likes of Nicole Kidman, Cara Delevingne, Linda Evangelista et al, all the way through to his more recent street-style shots. The designer has a long-standing relationship with the gallery, meaning images from his very fist collaboration with Gmurzynska, in the late 90s, will also be on show. Karl Lagerfeld: 30 Years of Exhibitions will run until May at Galerie Gmurzynska and will be complemented with a gallery publication as a homage to the life and work of Karl Lagerfeld.

"Objects described as 'nude' are often shades of beige and pink, and are not representative of all skin tones. Not so for shoe giant Christian Louboutin, who has become the first major luxury label to make its ‘nude’ products suitable for women of colour, extending its range of shoes to include a wider variety of skin tones. It’s a sure step forward for racial diversity in fashion. There are going to be two new styles in the Nude Collection, and a much wider colour palatte of seven tones, ranging from fair to chestnut. This is so any woman can get a shoe that matches the colour of her skin. Calling beige and peach items of clothing ‘nude’ has been labelled as ‘racist’, with good reason, aside from the political and sociological issues, it's a simply inaccurate way to describe a colour. The nude collection launched in 2013 and sparked copycats both in other fashion houses and on the high street. It‘s great that the makers of arguably the most famous shoes in the world have taken this into account and extended their brand, and it means that hopefully this will spark a change in the fashion industry, moving it towards being accepting of all skin tones. The new styles are Deepik, a peep-toe with scalloped edges, and Dorissima, which resembles their more classic stilettos. You can purchase these in any of the seven shades. All other shoe styles will be extended to include the new colours, too. It's odd that something which should be common sense – skin comes in different colours, so nude shoes should accommodate all of them as much as possible – is actually pioneering. It is, though, and it's not surprising that the brand behind the innovative Bondage Ballerina stilletto (on display at the V&A now!) is pushing boundaries that, for a lot of people, are closer to home. Louboutin will be celebrating this step forward in fashion by bringing #NudesForAll to social media, and the new range will be in shops in August. Check out more from Louboutin in this gallery of fashion's most extreme shoes.

"Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty might be about to close, but there are a lot of exciting fashion exhibitions on London’s horizon. There’s a Yohji Yamamoto one opening at Live Archives tomorrow and one dedicated to Chanel’s history hitting the Saatchi Gallery in October. And now, Louis Vuitton is getting in on the action. Set in a former office block neighbouring Somerset House, this ‘Instagram-friendly’ installation will span three floors and 13 rooms, giving a glimpse into the work behind Vuitton’s AW15 collection. Video footage from the show will be projected onto life-sized screens, emulating the view from the front row. The exhibition will conclude with a gallery of the house’s AW15 campaign which was shot by Juergen Teller and Bruce Weber. There’ll even be free posters and stickers for attendees. “In this digital era, fashion shows are diffused online and immediately accessible for the public,” Vuitton’s artistic director of women’s collections Nicolas Ghesquière told businessoffashion.com, explaining the rationale behind the exhibition. “But it takes more than that to feel the ambience and share the intense creativity, energy and emotion around one show. This is what we would like to share with a large public worldwide. The exhibition is conceived as a total, physical and interactive immersion inside Louis Vuitton’s (AW15) fashion show."" Series 3 will open on September 21. Watch Louis Vuitton’s AW15 show below:

"After causing outrage at the end of 2018, when chief marketing officer Ed Razek claimed trans women were not part of the label’s ‘fantasy’, Victoria’s Secret has seemingly finally realised we’re living in 2019 and hired its first trans model. Brazilian model Valentina Sampaio took to Instagram to share behind-the-scenes photographs and a video of herself on a shoot for the brand’s younger Pink line, in a post accompanied by the caption “Never stop dreaming”. Sampaio is no stranger to making history, after she became the first trans woman to cover Vogue Paris back in 2017 and appeared in the Brazilian edition a year later. The news comes after it was revealed there will be no televised Victoria’s Secret show this year after viewing stats fell to an all time low last year, and established Angels Karlie Kloss and Lily Aldridge railed against Razek’s comments via Instagram, which were originally published in an interview with Vogue ahead of the 2018 runway show. Soon after, Kloss gave up her wings, explaining to Vogue that the brand’s values no longer aligned with her own: “I didn’t feel it was an image that was truly reflective of who I am and the kind of message I want to send to young women around the world about what it means to be beautiful.” Razek also came under fire for his comments around plus-size models, claiming that, like trans models, they too are not part of the fantasy Victoria’s Secret is intent on offering up. As yet there has been no news of the inclusion of plus-size models going forward. While the move to feature Sampaio in its new campaign is a step forward for what has become a truly backwards-facing brand, we can’t help but feel slightly cynical about the news. Despite a push towards inclusivity by the fashion industry, Victoria’s Secret has trailed behind by continuing to offer an incredibly narrow ‘fantasy’ year after year, and with Razek still at its helm (despite calls for his resignation) the decision to now include a trans model on its line-up of Angels feels like an attempt to get the cash registers ringing amid falling sales as opposed to a genuine move towards diversity. In this case, you can keep your scratchy nylon knickers, VS – to us, it all feels just a little too late.

"On November 12, 1996, Lil’ Kim released her revolutionary solo debut album Hard Core. The 4’11” rapper burst into the music scene like a prolific sexual spitfire that could write rhymes that had more style and finesse than most of the top names in hip hop. The cover of Hard Core, styled by Misa Hylton, featured Lil’ Kim in a sheer blouse worn over lingerie, straddling a bear skin with bouquets of roses and a burning fireplace behind her. This photograph embodies everything that the album represented: a powerful woman owning her sexuality, ready to pounce. With the help of Hylton, Lil’ Kim quickly became a trailblazing fashion icon with her colourful wigs and provocative playful style that included the “Crush On You” video and red carpet moments like the lilac one-shouldered VMAs catsuit. Hylton got her big break when her boyfriend at the time, Sean “Puffy” Combs, was developing the group Jodeci for Uptown Records. Instead of putting them in suits, which was standard at the time, Hylton and Combs dressed them in combat boots, baseball caps, and leather. She went on to work with Mary J. Blige, Mase, Foxy Brown, and Jay-Z – in other words, you can’t talk about 90s hip hop and R&B style without mentioning Hylton’s name. Back then, it wasn’t as easy as calling up Gucci – working long before the fashion industry embraced hip hop, Hylton had to purchase luxury clothes for her clients with her own credit card because designers wouldn’t return her calls or confirm showroom appointments. As Hard Core turns 12, she tells us more about some of her most iconic moments. “Mary and Puff were creating a new sound, so it only made sense that the image reflected that energy. We were all very young and it was important to show our swag. Back then, most female artists that sang about love wore gowns and dressed up. There was space for something new. Mary was a hip hop girl at heart and sportswear has always been a staple in our community. I guess you can call it early tomboy chic.” “Although both women were from Brooklyn, if you look closely you see their different personalities and sense of style. Kim was a true B-girl at heart and Foxy had a West Indian flavor. Kim and Foxy created the space for female rappers to be feminine and sexy. As women, we get to choose how we show up whether it’s in baggy clothes or wardrobe that celebrates the female body. They liberated women.” “I convinced Puff to sign him, when his image was in question. I thought that BIG could be that big, black, sexy guy. The type of hustler you would see who was fresh to death in any hood in America.” “I knew I wanted to work with Dapper Dan because not only did he understand hip hop culture and style, his workmanship was great and he paid attention to detail. He also made the legendary snorkel coat for street legend Aberto “Alpo” Martinez so I knew he would bring Missy’s pink snorkle to life in true hip hop fashion. We have collaborated on so many projects! We made shorts for rapper Trina made out of real $100 bills I think it took $2k! We created the black and white Fendi Zucca print suits for Puff, G. Dep and Black Rob for the video “Let’s Get It.” We created wardrobe for Missy’s toursand a hot pink and black Greek keys (Versace) one piece for her video with Fantasia. Most recently Dap created the suits for Justin and Christian Combs where they paid homage to Eric B and Rakim’s album cover “Paid in Full” in a music video which was styled by my right hand Jai Hudson.” “I think that Kim and I were magical together and when you have that type of synergy only greatness can come forth. We were thinking outside of the box and unapologetically taking risks. People gravitate to that type of authentic and creative energy.” “I think that the younger generation loves the authenticity and creativity of the 90s hip hop trends, our ideas were based on being unique and expressing ourselves as individuals. We weren’t afraid to dream and champion not only hip hop culture but also youth culture at the same time. We decided how we wanted to look and sound. That is powerful. The fashion looked good and it feels even better. We had the opportunity to let our ideas marinate and take form. We didn’t have social media critics or any outside forces interrupting the flow. It was a golden time.”

"It’s official: after 14 years of harmonising with its main line, Marc by Marc Jacobs will no longer serve up its selection to Marc Jacobs fans. The ready-to-wear line, currently headed up by Katie Hiller and Luella Bartley, is to be merged with the designer's primary collection, combining the strengths of both lines into one. WWD confirmed the news today, adding that the move will ""assimilate that collection’s product range and price points into the signature Marc Jacobs collection"". It is not known what will happen to the roles of Hillier and Bartley, who are currently creative director and womenswear design director respectively. ""In a sense, we’re starting at the beginning,"" Jacobs told WWD, before adding, ""it sounds like a musical... a very good place to start."" Marc by Marc Jacobs began in spring 2001 as a means for a younger demographic to cheaply tap into Marc's world, selling both mens and womenswear at an affordable mid-price point. Hillier and Bartley were given creative control in July 2013, steering the youth aesthetic of the 14-year-old brand. Jacobs said that he had ""absolutely enjoyed the last few seasons of the Marc by Marc Jacobs’ young, cool, hip shows"", but explained ""it just feels like we aren’t doing that job by showing two different collections with two different messages"". ""We’ve gone through many different ways looking at what [Marc by Marc Jacobs] was initially and how it had gotten away from that, and I think again we’re back to that same thing,"" he added. ""The way to do it is that this is under one label.""

"Hot on the heels of the announcement that Jonathan Anderson is taking his eponymous brand to Paris for the AW19 men’s collection, Moschino has now announced that it will also be relocating from its regular home for its next show. Instead of Milan, the Italian label will head to Rome to present both its AW19 menswear and womenswear Pre-Fall 2019 collections. “For Pre-Fall 2019 I have chosen to show the collection in Rome at the historic Cinecittà studios,” creative director Jeremy Scott said in a statement. For the show’s theme, the designer will pay homage to filmmaker Federico Fellini, who shot many of his famed works in the city. “I’ve taken inspiration from his body of work and the amazing characters he has created from the films Roma, La Dolce Vita, Satyricon, 8 1/2, Casanova to name a few,” Scott continues. Little else is known about what will take place at the show, but save the date for January 8 when it will all take place.

"Yesterday marked the eight-month anniversary of Raf Simons’ surprise departure from Christian Dior, where he had held the position of creative director for three and a half years. Today, it has been reported that the house has finally appointed his successor: Valentino’s joint creative director, Maria Grazia Chiuri. News source Reuters gleaned the information from “two people familiar with the matter”. “I understand that it will be announced after the (July) couture show,” said one of these sources, according to the site. If true, Chiuri will be the first female creative director in the company’s 70-year history, following in the footsteps of Simons, John Galliano, Gianfranco Ferre and Yves Saint Laurent. She and Pierpaolo Piccioli have been the creative directors of Valentino since September 2007, when Monsieur Valentino decided to retire. Here, they’ve been lauded for breathing new creative energy into the brand, and for revitalising its menswear line. Since Simons’ departure, Dior’s collections have been designed by an in-house team led by Lucie Meier and Serge Ruffieux. In May, the house staged its Cruise 2017 show, presenting its latest collection which brought together Parisian style with that of the English countryside. As for whether there’s any validity to these rumours, time will tell. We have reached out to Dior for comment.

"Anja Rubik is a pro at looking good – you only need to look at her long list of campaigns and shows, including Marc Jacobs and Gucci – to know that. But did you know that she is also a Polish music video star in her homeland and now, a perfumier? And one with pretty unusual references, to boot. At the launch of her new fragrance Original by Anja Rubik, she bigged up her love for Patti Smith and Debbie Harry and explained how the female rock gods (and Robert Mapplethorpe) inspired the scent. ""When I was building a mood board for the fragrance there was actually a lot of Patti Smith, Debbie Harry and a lot of Mapplethorpe’s photography,"" the Polish supermodel told Dazed. ""Patti is a huge girl power icon, Debbie as well. I mean, you know they really went for their own vision; they were breaking a lot of rules. They were doing things that were representing them – they never sold out, which is beautiful."" She added: ""I really wanted to create fragrance that represents me and my vision of beauty. I decided to do the whole fragrance in the aesthetics of black and white because I find it incredibly timeless. The way [Mapplethorpe] photographed flowers, especially lillies... symbolically it’s very erotic."" Hence, she explained, the top note of lillies, put in place in memory of Mapplethorpe. But Rubik has designs way beyond your pulse points and post-shower routine – she is also trying to appeal to a higher cause. ""The whole idea was that it’s not only a beautiful fragrance, but also connects with a visual statement that is all about empowerment in women. The idea is there is the message that you get with the bottle and, then you connect the smell with the message and then later on, when you smell it on yourself, on your clothes, it triggers that emotion."" An emotion of being one of the top-paid models in the game? We're into that. But until you turn into a leggy 5""9' supermodel, you can watch Rubik in one of the best Polish music videos you'll see all year. Check out ""Chleb"" below.

"Any fashion week is a treasure chest for street style photographers; fashion’s masses line the streets at their most exhibitionist, posing (or pretending not to) before an array of hungry cameras. But what’s more interesting to Yu Fujiwara – documenting for Dazed – is the minutia that normally slips through the cracks. While Virgil Abloh debuted at Louis Vuitton and Kim Jones looked back to Dior’s beginnings at Paris menswear last month, Fujiwara captured trainers against a backdrop of chalk drawings, clamouring photographers (meta), and bystanders inexplicably wearing sweltering leather. Other shots capture models idling in the French summer sun and Abloh himself, throwing up a relaxed-looking peace sign and surrounded by adoring fans.

"Towards the end of last year, Pharrell announced that he would be dropping a collection created in collaboration with Chanel. Attending the Parisian house’s Cruise 2018 show in Bangkok, the singer appeared in a yellow hoodie emblazoned with sequinned Chanel insignia – later to be revealed that it was designed by him. Now, the musician has released a behind-the-scenes film ahead of the collection’s release exclusively in Seoul on March 29, and worldwide on April 4. The film sees Pharrell talking about his relationship with the house – he’s previously appeared in a number of campaigns, designed a trainer in collaboration with adidas, and also made a runway appearance last year – and how the collaboration came about thanks to the late creative director Karl Lagerfeld, before his death. The film shows a glimpse of the collection – modelled by a diverse cast made up of Alton Mason, Adesuwa, Adut Akech, and Anok Yai – that mixes classic Chanel elements with a more streetwear-esque feel. Think diamond chains that say ‘CHANEL PHARRELL’, tees and hoodies, and oversized shoppers. The singer himself also appears in the film, pairing the collection with Chanel pearls necklaces – something he wants more people to explore: gender-fluidity in fashion. Teasing the creation of the campaign in the film, keep an eye out for the full collection and more later this week. Watch the full film below.

"Back in March, we reported that a new era of Helmut Lang was coming – Hood By Air’s Shayne Oliver would be designing a collection, with Dazed’s Editor-in-Chief, Isabella Burley, acting as the brand’s Editor-in-Residence. Now, the label has shared more of what’s to come – dropping part of a campaign by Ethan James Green, launching a new website and social media account, and announcing a series of forthcoming projects. First up – the images. Starring adult film star turned cult Cry Baby actress Traci Lords, model Alek Wek, street cast muses Dara, Yoshi and Nicky Rat and finally Oliver himself, the series exhibits a preview of what we can expect from the designer. There are references to the archive – like the nipple-bearing tank top, and the return to the brand’s original logo. That’s not it. More pictures slated to drop in the coming days will star I Love Dick author Chris Kraus, legendary director Larry Clark, performance artist Kembra Pfahler, designer Gogo Graham, musician Ian Isiah, eight-year-old activist Mari Copeny Aka “Little Miss Flint”, model Sohyun Jung, and metal band Unlocking The Truth, alongside street cast characters Alanie Quinones, Grace Gee and Aurel Haize. They are all styled by Dazed’s Creative Director Robbie Spencer. Alongside the campaign, Helmut Lang has announced two new projects: Helmut Lang Re-Edition will centre around the reissue of important heritage pieces – Volume 1 will be available in September 2017, and will feature fifteen items. Future Volumes will be released every four months. Secondly, the brand’s ties to the world of art (famous past campaigns including the work of esteemed figures such as Robert Mapplethorpe and Louise Bourgeois) will be revived. Once a month, a new artist will release a set of imagery for a series called Seen By. These promise to uncover and re-contextualise cult artworks as limited-edition posters, t-shirts and special products. The list of names of those confirmed reads like a who’s who of contemporary art and photography: Leigh Ledare, Carolee Schneemann, Boris Mikhailov, Peter Hujar, Walter Pfeiffer, Keizo Kitajima, Adrienne Salinger, Martine Syms, Mark Morrisroe, Paul Mpagi Sepuya, Andrew Miksys and Carrie Mae Weems. A percentage of the sale of their limited edition merch will be donated to a charity of the artist’s choice. The final piece of news is that Shayne Oliver’s collection, entitled HELMUT LANG SEEN BY SHAYNE OLIVER, will debut on Monday September 11 during New York Fashion Week.

"In today’s, um, rather strange news, a designer is planning to making a range of “human leather” goods using skin grown from Alexander McQueen’s DNA. Tina Gorjanc has sourced the late designer’s DNA from his first collection, ‘Jack the Ripper Stalks His Victims’, the labels of which comprise of a single lock of his hair suspended within a clear plastic pocket. She plans to harvest the DNA from these hairs into skin tissue, which she’ll then tan and turn into human leather. In turn, she’ll fashion this leather into an already-designed collection – dubbed “The Pure Human” – of jackets, bags and backpacks. At this point, you might be asking why. Well, in an interview with Dezeen, Gorjanc explains – “The Pure Human project was designed as a critical design project that aims to address shortcomings concerning the protection of biological information and move the debate forward using current legal structures,” she says. “If a student like me was able to patent a material extracted from Alexander McQueen’s biological information as there was no legislation to stop me, we can only imagine what big corporations with bigger funding are going to be capable of doing in the future.” So it’s effectively a comment on data protection, not the brainchild of a McQueen superfan. At the moment, however, the project is still in its conceptual phase – though she’s already created some prototypes (out of pig skin), filed for a patent and persuaded the owner of McQueen’s ‘Jack the Ripper Stalks His Victims’ to give her a hair. But this isn’t the first time someone has attempted to use human matter to make clothes. In recent years, people have hit the headlines for making pendants out of breast milk and human bones, shoes out of teeth and most recently, a dress out of pubic hair. Find out more about the project here.

"Legendary fashion photographer Tim Walker’s dreamy, fantasy-filled images have captivated audiences all over the world, which is no surprise why his work has been exhibited time and time again. His latest exhibition – set to be the largest ever – has been just announced, opening at London’s Victoria & Albert Museum on September 21. Entitled Tim Walker: Wonderful Things, it’s designed by artist and set designer Shona Heath – who is a longtime collaborator with Walker – and will feature over 300 items, from shoot images to props, behind-the-scenes films, and scrapbooks and sketches. Text written by the photographer himself will also be displayed around the space. “To me, the V&A has always been a palace of dreams – it’s the most inspiring place in the world,” Walker says. “Preparing for this exhibition over the past three years has pushed me into new territories, which is very exciting, and I’m at a stage in my life where I feel brave enough to do that.” Elsewhere at the exhibition, the ‘Illuminations’ room will Undoubtedly set to be a popular visit – like the museum’s current Christian Dior exhibition, that was recently extended due to its popularity – make sure you’re ready for when tickets drop on June 13.

"In the current global political climate, it is easy to believe that those in power are the bad guys. Perhaps Yang Li agrees, as this season he’s taken inspiration from villains – albeit cinematic ones. “On the surface, the villains in film are the most well dressed… almost perversely well dressed,” explains Li, who wanted to explore a different villain over three seasons. Last season, the ‘Yang Li Villain Trilogy’ saw the horror film killer brought to life – complete with leather gloves and sinister stares. This time, he focussed on the corrupt cop. “The dirty cop is perhaps one of the ultimate anti-heroes as a figure of authority,” the designer said. Taking inspiration from a host of characters including Gary Oldman in Léon: The Professional and Harvey Keitel in Bad Lieutenant (the ultimate bad cop, says Li) – he even referenced Brooklyn’s real-life corrupt cop, Mike Dowd. The lookbook is photographed by Robi Rodriguez and styled by Another Man’s Fashion Director Ellie Grace Cumming with art direction by Dazed’s Jamie Reid. Much like the detectives in the films, the cop in the SS18 collection favours loose fitting tailoring, often with rolled up sleeves and shirts unbuttoned at the collar. A police car sets the scene; the dashboard covered in used Marlboro Red packets. The theme is continued with thick-soled, black boots and Sheriff-like, boxy beige shirts complete with aviator sunglasses – there’s even a cop badge on one of the looks. With the bad cop and the serial killer ticked off the villain checklist, you’ll have to wait for the AW18 collection to see who Li chooses next season to complete the trilogy.

"At Prada’s SS15 runway show, Australian model Gemma Ward staged a comeback following a six-year hiatus from the fashion industry. She hasn’t trod the runway boards since then. Until this afternoon that is, when she made a surprise appearance at Calvin Klein’s AW16 menswear show – wearing what appeared to be menswear. “I always liked her,” said Calvin Klein Collection men’s creative director Italo Zucchelli backstage at the show. “She has these brilliant eyes, almost alien...she’s beautiful…” But Ward wasn’t the only female model to walk; she was joined by fellow industry icons Mariacarla Boscono, Jessica Miller and Iselin Steiro. And this isn’t an isolated incident – it’s become commonplace to see both genders walk in the same show. Speaking on his decision to include female models in the cast, Zucchelli said, “I wanted to give a statement about the power of tailoring. How it’s modern, how it looks good on everybody. It also can be sexy... Tailoring on women is nice!” Tailoring appeared throughout the collection, predominantly in black and white, but with flecks of camel, khaki, gold, silver and copper too. It was sleek and heavily imbued with Zucchelli’s sense of sublime futurism. Watch Calvin Klein’s AW16 menswear show below:

"Another week, another fashion capital. The shows have arrived in Paris, with Dior kicking things off as usual. This season, Maria Grazia Chiuri explored the work, politics, life and style of female artists – focussing on one in particular. Here's what went down. The set out the back of the Musée Rodin had a giant stone facade, with a quote about tarot cards by artist Niki de Saint Phalle – the sculptor known for her shapely and colourful female figures – etched into its surface. Decorating the inside of the show space, which had walls and a ceiling made to look like smooth clay, were clusters of shattered mirror fragments. At the foot of the runway was a glittering cavern, which resembled the totally mad house de Saint Phalle lived in in Tuscany – a giant sphinx with a shiny silver reflective interior. It’s not often you find feminist literature on the seats at fashion shows, but it’s something we could certainly get used to. This afternoon’s show came with free reading material: the essay “Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists”, published by Linda Nochlin in 1971 in the journal Woman in Sexist Society: Studies in Power and Powerlessness. A seminal text of feminist art history, Nochlin questions the barriers in place which have meant that there are apparently no female equivalents to Michelangelo or Picasso – and breaks down privilege and institutional power structures as she does so. ...in a classic French Breton striped top and jeans, her long sleeved t-shirt bearing the title of Nochlin’s essay. Consider this the new ‘We Should All Be Feminists’ t-shirt. A group of girls in denim and black followed, but things soon got a lot more colourful. A friend and muse to designer Marc Bohan (who took over at Dior after Yves Saint Laurent was called up for military service and then fired in 1960) Niki de Saint Phalle’s influence wasn’t just in the set. The colours and prints of her art snaked across skirts and appeared on sequinned mini dresses that had a 60s, countercultural flare, and her name featured on jumpers alongside spider and dinosaur motifs. If last season’s muses had adopted a beret-wearing intellectualism, this was them moving into the artist commune and letting loose. There were also design tributes to Marc Bohan’s archive (the polka dots, men’s shirts and romantic white), continuing Maria Grazia’s efforts to incorporate the work of previous Dior designers. Maria Grazia’s era of Dior is all about women and what they’re capable of – while in her first show she exhibited fencing uniforms, this time around there were a series of biker girl looks, including some colourful racing driver jumpsuits and one black leathery all in one that was very The Girl on a Motorcycle (1968). The famous flag in black and white check was turned into overalls, bags, and even pool sliders – and was also a reference to Bohan’s historic creations. In the show notes, Grazia Chiuri acknowledged the influence of the Swinging 60s, an era of real change when it comes to women’s freedoms. The decade could be felt in the silver gogo boots, heart decorated dresses, and one paisley-patterned woven jumper – not to mention the soundtrack. Watch the highlights from the show below:

"At only 14 years old, Yoshi is an Instagram phenomenon. After getting noticed by Off-White’s Virgil Abloh, he’s quickly become a style icon on the streets of Tokyo. Scrolling through his Instagram, there’s no doubt that Yoshi boasts an innate sense of style that stands between punk and luxury streetwear. When he’s not taking lift selfies, he’s hanging out with his friends – Nicola Formichetti, Kim Jones, and LA-based artist gab3 among them. Now, with over 40k followers on IG, Yoshi is also a model in his own right – last year he appeared in a Helmut Lang campaign and he recently started walking on runways too. “The very first item I bought was at the vintage shop in (Tokyo’s district) Jujo called GBM,” Yoshi tells us in a new Dazed film. “It was a pink Marilyn Manson t-shirt. I didn’t know what it was but the owner recommended it to me and I bought it.” Since then, he has grown his wardrobe significantly, regularly wearing edgy looks made up of coloured biker jackets, Vetements-inspired coats and customised denim, that he finds browsing the city’s biggest vintage stores. Elsewhere in the video, Yoshi shops in his fave vintage stores, draws, and plays video games just a normal kid. But, unlike a normal kid, he also shoots scenes for a music video from Japanese rapper Anarchy. “I’m working as a model and as a designer too, so I earn money by myself,” he continues. “Right now, I don’t have an agent or manager, so I always do everything by myself – I even negotiate my fee too.” Just your regular 14-year-old model slash icon. Watch the film above.

"Cara Delevingne, one of the world's most successful models, has offered an illuminating insight into her feelings on fashion, revealing that she's never felt totally comfortable in the industry. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Delevingne said: ""I ended up feeling a bit empty. Fashion is about what’s on the outside, and that’s it. There’s no searching, it’s just creating pretty things.” She also hit out at people who called her up to criticise her partying habits or her appearance. “It’s horrible living in a world where I’ll get a call from someone saying,‘so-and-so says you were partying a lot and you were looking this way and you need to lose weight’,” she said. “It makes me so angry. If you don’t want to hire me, don’t hire me.” Delevingne appears to be edging her way out of fashion and into film, having recently landed a lead role in Paper Towns, a screen adaptation of John Green's bestselling novel. She did suffer rejection recently, when she discovered that she'd been rejected for a role in a Beach Boys film that in the end didn't get made. Who offered a shoulder to cry on? Rihanna. We've all had setbacks in our lives, times when we've stared into the abyss and wondered how much longer we can really go on (every morning 9am), but not many of us can say that it was Rihanna who coached us through the tough times. Of course, if you're Cara Delevingne you mix in more elite circles than the squares I'm trapped in. Delevingne revealed that she was “heartbroken” at not getting the part. “With modeling, if someone else gets a job, I’m like, Yeah, of course, there are so many better models,” she said. “But with acting, you grow such an attachment to each role.” After learning of her rejection, Delevingne called Rihanna, who comforted her through the tough times. “Everything happens for a reason,” said Life Coach RiRi. “You are going to call me back up in a week or two, and you are going to say to me, ‘You are right.’” Soon afterwards, Delevingne landed the role in Paper Towns, thus affirming Rihanna's position on this earth as a spirit guide slash globally successful popstar. UPDATE: Micheal Sucsy, the director of the Beach Boys film All Summer Long, contacted Dazed to tell us that Delevingne did get the role, but the studio just shelved the project. ""Cara wasn't rejected for All Summer Long – quite the opposite,"" he told us. ""She gave an impressive audition and won the role. Unfortunately, the studio didn't pull the trigger on the film."" Looks like Rihanna may have done all that life coaching for nothing.

"Over the course of the last few years, Balenciaga has been presenting a unique vision of the future on each of its PFW runways. From that time models clad in 3D-printed officewear stormed through a tunnel lit by computer code (as imagined by artist Jon Rafman), to its trippy af SS19 campaign, which saw digitally rendered models contort into not-of-this-world positions, under Demna’s rule, at the Spanish house, the future is now. Now, the label is set to open an equally forward-facing store on London’s Sloane Street – its second after its Mayfair boutique. Featuring innovative conveyor belt-style rails, stark LED lighting, and all the Matrix-style sunglasses, logo-emblazoned bags, and Triple S colourways you can think of (obvs), the experience is completed by two hyper-real model mannequins made in the image of Balenciaga faves Eliza Douglas and Takato Harashima, who peer out of the window at passersby. The new Balenciaga store throws open its doors today. Head to Sloane Street to check it out for yourself.

"It’s no secret that getting a pop star to wear your designs – whether you’re an emerging creative or someone who’s long been established on the fashion scene – is a stroke of gold. Whether they’re sitting front row at fashion week, or storming the runway like J.Lo did at Versace this season, their presence is guaranteed to garner column inches and double-taps, and bring the brand a whole new audience in the form of said celeb’s fandom in the process. What’s that sound in the distance? It’s the sound of tills ringing, duh! There are plenty of brands going one step further than just the frow, though, by enlisting pop stars to get involved with the creative process and debut their own collaborative collections. Remember that time JW Anderson worked with A$AP Rocky or when Karl Lagerfeld recruited Pharrell for Chanel? 2019 alone has seen Billie Eilish join forces with MCM, Honey Dijon drop a Comme des Garçons collab, and Nicki Minaj team up with Fendi on an offering which even came with its own soundtrack. And then there’s the celebrity fashion campaign, which caught on in the early 00s when Christina Aguilera became the face of Versace. In the years since, we’ve seen Miley Cyrus for Marc Jacobs, Madonna front Louis Vuitton, and Britney take an iconic turn for Kenzo for SS18. With that in mind, here we take a look back at the times fashion campaigns went pop. In 2003, six years after taking the helm at her late brother’s brand, Donatella Versace enlisted Christina Aguilera to star in the Versace AW03 campaign. With her oh-so-Y2K bottom lip and nose piercings, the iconic images show a then-22 year-old Xtina wearing a series of corseted looks, as shot by legendary photographer Steven Meisel. At the time, Donatella told People “I watch the videos of Christina and I always die. She is a great dancer, a great singer, her voice is amazing. I always hoped I could do something with her, but I wanted to be friends first – that is the most important thing for me.” Long before Rihanna launched Fenty and began her domination of every part of the fashion industry, the Bajan singer was already heavily involved in the world of fashion. Her first appearance as a model was in 2011 when she was featured in an Emporio Armani and Armani Jeans campaign – before she became the new face of Parisian luxury house Balmain’s SS14 campaign three years later. Shot in New York by Dutch photography duo Inez and Vinoodh, the campaign marked five years of Olivier Rousteing’s reign at Balmain, and was styled by her personal stylist Mel Ottenberg. One thing we all know is that Lady Gaga is a chameleon. She has the ability to transform herself into anyone or anything she wants to be – and in 2013, she became Donatella Versace. Soon after she dropped her song “Donatella”, the third track from her studio album Artpop, the eclectic singer appeared as the embodiment of the Italian designer for the label's SS14 campaign. Lensed by Mert and Marcus, Gaga appeared in the campaign sporting dead-straight, extremely long blonde locks, looking uncannily similar to queen Versace herself. Yes, Rihanna deserves to be on this list twice. Why? Because in May 2015, the iconic Ms. Fenty made history when she became the first black woman to front a Dior campaign. Shot as part of Raf Simons’ Secret Garden series, the project was captured after sunset at the Chateau de Versailles by American photographer Steven Klein. The accompanying film sees Rihanna walk through famous parts of the location, including the hall of mirrors, as she casually makes the castle her home. The campaign was inspired by the designer’s Japan-influenced Pre-AW14 collection, which at the time Simons told Dazed was about, ‘this idea of the metropol and in this city’. Throughout his career, designer Karl Lagerfeld had a bunch of muses he would draw inspiration from and collaborate with (remember when he went through that phase of being obsessed with Lily Allen?) The most enduring source of inspiration was probably Pharrell Williams, who over the years has appeared both on the runway and in a series of campaigns. For the Pre-fall 2015 campaign, Williams starred alongside Cara Delevingne and Lagerfeld’s godson Brad Kroenig. The collection, which took inspiration from nobles in 19th century Austria, was shown in Salzburg, where Williams didn’t just walk the runway, but also featured in an accompanying fashion film called Reincarnation. In the time since the passing of Lagerfeld back in February, Williams has debuted his first Chanel Pharrell Collection and debuted a short film featuring models Adut Akech, Adesuwa, Anok Yai and Alton Mason. As part of a series entitled Army of Lovers, Kanye was joined by wife Kim Kardashian for the Balmain SS15 menswear campaign, as photographed by Mario Sorrenti. The couple were shot up close and personal against a backdrop consisting of a black sports car and strip lights, with the images marking the first time the two had appeared in a campaign together. Since then, West has collaborated with Olivier Rousteing several times, including on the music video for his song “Wolves”, and a number of Balmain x Yeezy garments – as worn by the Kardashian-Jenners at the Madison Square Garden Yeezy Season 3 show in NYC. Shot in Los Angeles, towards the beginning of last year, Britney Spears fronted the SS18 campaign for Kenzo’s La Collection Momento line – instigated by former Kenzo creative directors Humberto Leon and Carol Lim. The images marked Spears’ debut high fashion campaign and were captured by the late Peter Lindbergh, in a throwback 80s style. Appearing in a series of full denim looks, the pop icon cemented her status as the unofficial blue jean queen, as if we were ever in need of clarification. Within a few months of starring in a Calvin Klein Jeans campaign, teenage music sensation Billie Eilish appeared in her sophomore fashion campaign for luxury leather brand MCM, shot by Lea Colombo. A first for the brand’s new global creative officer, Dirk Schönberger, the campaign shows Billie as we all know her – looking cool, in oversized clothing. “For me, she’s a bit of a role model for younger generations, even though she would probably hate the word. I’ve seen her play concerts and she tells her fans to be themselves without holding back,” Schönberger explained to WWD of his partnership with Eilish. Not surprising, given that she’s made it crystal clear she doesn’t give a shit what anyone thinks. Earlier this year, Givenchy posted a few less than cryptic teasers of its latest campaign, featuring its new brand ambassador. It was pretty obvious to almost any human being that has been aware of pop culture in the last few years that the person in question was, indeed, Ariana Grande and her legendary ponytail. The full campaign dropped in the early summer months, with the series itself featuring a series of portraits of the star. Lensed by Craig McDean, there was also a mini film in which she broke into impromptu song. Iconic yes, but did it beat Yes, Egg? Hmmm... hold the line, caller.

"There are few initials in fashion more famous than DKNY, but for the brand's AW16 show, they took on new meanings in a series of slogan sweatshirts. Some were branded with ‘Designers Know Nothing Yet’, others with ‘Don’t Knock New York’ and the rest with our personal favourite, ‘Dazed Kids New York’. The designs will finally become available in the UK this Thursday, and, naturally, creative directors Dao-Yi Chow and Maxwell Osborne (also of Public School) are teaming with Dazed for the launch party. DJs including Throwing Shade, Nadia Rose and even Chow himself will hit the decks, while a series of limited edition DKNY x Dazed t-shirts will also be given out to industry insiders and guests, with the hashtag #DazedKidsNewYork capturing the action live from the event. “London is this amazing street-based city with so much underground culture happening,” the creative directors shared of choosing to bring their vision across the pond. “It speaks to the idea of convergence in the same way we learned about it growing up in NYC. It’s technically a European city, but it feels really close to home.” Although the ‘Dazed Kids New York’ t-shirt wasn’t a direct reference, Chow and Osborne did reveal that the ‘Dazed Kid’ does have a deeper meaning. “It's someone who, at an early age, understands the power of their opinion and point of view. It’s someone who is interested in the arts, music and culture in general. They want to contribute to it in some way and leave their mark.” Of course, slogans are a go-to form of self-expression. “We had been playing around with the idea of logos and how ubiquitous they’ve become,"" said Chow and Osborne. ""We were poking fun at it all and obviously we have a huge history with using logos. So it was just a way to deconstruct it and put it back together again by creating some new meanings for DKNY. We didn’t know what it actually stood for, so it was cool to try and come up with different meanings.” The sweatshirts will be available mid-June from retailers including Harrods, Harvey Nichols, DKNY Bond St. and Brown Thomas.

"Jonny Banger, aka Sports Banger, aka the bootlegging king of the UK fashion scene, has finally gone legit with his latest collection with British based tennis brand Slazenger. Named ‘Slazenger Banger’, the collaboration has flown off the shelves of all the Sports Direct stores nationwide that it’s been stocked in since the end of June. The collab is already becoming, like Jonny’s previous sportswear bootlegs, the go-to garment of choice for UK ravers and festival-goers this summer. Mixing luxury items like champagne flutes, bathrobes and lilos with more obvious sportswear choices like leggings, sports bras, t-shirts and trainers, the unisex collection is simplistic in its design, but playful in the acid-themed colour schemes. Jonny cites Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour campaign slogan ‘For the many, not the for few’ as the reasoning behind his pricing, which for contemporary sportswear is ridiculously low. With trainers only costing £29.99 and t-shirts going for £14.99, this kind of affordability is something rarely, if ever, seen in such a collection. Wanting to find out more, I sat down with the Tottenham-based designer to see how Sports Banger and the Slazenger Banger collab came about, and why he decided to put £5 notes in the soles of his new trainers. How and why did you start Sports Banger? Jonny Banger: It was my birthday, so I did myself a birthday t-shirt. It said 'FREE TULISA' after she had just been nicked. I was chasing a girl and she was working Wireless Festival, so the only way I could get in was if I sorted Skream a ‘FREE TULISA’ t-shirt. Both Skream and Jordan Rizzle Kicks wore them on stage. The whole thing went viral. The t-shirt got a lot of attention, so I quickly knocked up a website and the Sports Banger brand. What was your background in fashion before that? Jonny Banger: From the age of ten to 15 I worked at my dad's best mate’s shop called Royal Sports, named after his two kids Roy and Alan in Farnborough. I was doing markets, car boots, and running around this warehouse with my Mindwarp tape pack playing. I was printing football shirts for local teams. It was all Umbro, Reebok, Burberry, Ralph Lauren, so much of this stuff. It was only when his mate went to prison and there was an article in the newspaper that I realised it was all moody (fake) gear from Portugal. Why did you want to collaborate with Slazenger? Jonny Banger: I love Slazenger, it's got proper history. Ralph Slazenger was from Manchester, and moved to London Cannon Street in 1881, opening a shop selling rubber sporting goods. In 1902 Slazenger became official supplier of tennis balls to Wimbledon. In 1909 Ralph Slazenger was Sheriff of London for one year. In 1966 the World Cup football was Slazenger. In 1986 they introduced the optic yellow tennis ball to Wimbledon. In 1987 acid house first hit the UK. I wanted to use better fabrics and colours, with a better cut, but wanted to keep it true to everyone with the price point. I didn't want to ham-fist a trendy version or put off original Slazenger wearers. You can wear Slazenger alongside Slazenger Banger. What were you inspired by when you designed the collection? Jonny Banger: Benny Ill from Horsepower Productions – who is an original Slazenger wearer – boats, bootlegging, raves and mates. Lots of people have dropped tennis collections with a court and net as the look. We took tennis to the streets and shot on Seven Sisters Road and then to the high seas in Southampton: aqua tennis. You're notorious for bootlegging and giving new life to classic brands. Was it a challenge to create your own stuff or was it almost a relief to be able to do your own thing? Jonny Banger: It was a dream to produce a full range with no restrictions, rather than just dropping one t-shirt at a time. Not having to post it myself has been amazing. I've gone from having the longest delivery terms to the quickest. I've put out a lot of singles – hit t-shirts – but this is like my album. “Start where you are, use what you've got, and do what you can” – Jonny Banger You’ve always been quite political. Was the decision to keep prices low and sell in Sports Direct in line with that? Jonny Banger: I never liked the “are you cool enough to wear this”, and “have you got enough money to wear this”. Everyone's invited. There's a history, sound, vibe behind the whole thing. What's the story behind the fiver in the bottom of the trainers? Jonny Banger: When I was at school in Colchester I remember a rumour of Reebok Classic ice soles with fivers in. (Artist Oliver Payne) referenced the same rumour by cutting open some ice soles, putting fivers in then displaying on a photocopier. If you hit the button, you got the photocopied £5 soles. I wonder where those ones are. I’ve got testimonials from lots of people, saying their friends had some or they've seen them, but I still don't believe them. I still can't believe I got permission from the Bank of England for these trainers, to step on the Queen's face. What have you learned from creating Slazenger Banger, and what advice would you give to anyone else looking to make their own clothes? Jonny Banger: I've learnt that big retail operations have the same problems as small two-bob operations. Start where you are, use what you've got, and do what you can. If you've got an idea, do it and stand behind it. If there's no heart or passion in it, you're fucked. What's next for Sports Banger? Jonny Banger: Got lots planned, looking forward to getting some records out on the label. It's all about the sound, fashion and art comes from the sounds. You can close your eyes but you can't close your ears. The record label is called HERAS, after the fence. The music sounds like what the fence looks like; hard, obnoxious, industrial and metallic with classic design.

"Prepare to lay your eyes on what could perhaps be the most 80s thing you’ve ever seen. We’ve clambered out of a deep (deep) YouTube hole to present you with “How To Do That” – a (criminally) forgotten 1989 electro-pop track recorded by none other than Jean Paul Gaultier, who this week staged a very 60s-inspired couture show which featured a cameo from model Coco Rocha and her mini-me daughter. Awww. Though Gaultier is well-known as the enfant terrible of French fashion, and as Antoine de Caune’s partner-in-crime on Eurotrash, that he also fancied himself as a pop-star might just be brand new infomation to many. The video for “How To Do That” sees Gaultier sketching away at his desk, waiting for inspiration to strike, as models including a v fresh-faced Naomi Campbell throw some pretty interesting moves – all while wearing classic JPG styles. Breton tops? Button-down military-inspired jackets? Conical bras? Check, check and check. The track was produced by Tony Mansfield, who was behind (slightly more successful – sorry Jean Paul) hits by a-ha and the B-52s, which should give you an idea as to what to expect, and since we first watched it, it’s pretty safe to say we’ve barely been able to get it out of our heads.

"Though it counts the likes of SZA and Miley Cyrus among its fans, chances are you might not be familiar with Paris-based label Neith Nyer just yet. Founded in 2015 by Francisco Terra, the brand’s diaphanous ruched dresses, sheer, nipple-baring blouses, peek-a-boo cutouts, and split-to-the-waist trousers offer a balance of high and low culture, bad taste, nostalgia and overt sexuality – something Terre puts down to his South American heritage. Having grown up in Brazil, the designer moved to the French capital over a decade ago, but the country remains integral to his work. “My work puts strong emphasis on a woman’s body, it’s very sexy,” he tells us. “I like short, I like tight, you know, I think women’s bodies are meant to be shown and appreciated – but not just in a sexual way. In Brazil, you can go out in short-shorts, you can go out topless, whatever you look like, and it’s not really a big deal. I think it’s given my work a sense of freedom, I want to make clothes that allow you to celebrate and accept your body.” Acceptance is a core theme that runs throughout Terra’s work. Despite the hyper-femininity of some of his designs, they’re in no way restricted to being worn by women – the last few seasons have seen him send male models wearing his collection down the catwalk as part of his PFW shows, too. “It comes from a personal place, I think,” the designer explains. “I never make the conscious decision to dress myself in menswear. I design for women, but if boys want to wear it, great. I want my clothing to be worn by a diverse range of people, which is why when I cast my shows I have artists and stylists and writers and fashion editors modelling for me. I don’t want to say ‘real’, because everyone is real. But at the end of the day, my clothes are going to be worn by people that aren’t models, and I want to reflect that on my catwalk.” With Neith Nyer, Terra is keen to tell a story with each collection he creates, calling his label “a sort of ‘dear diary’ – everything I design is inspired by something I’ve lived.” For SS18, this amounted to a deeply personal tribute to his sister, who passed away when she was 18, while this season he takes inspiration from the crazy parties his parents used to throw when he was a child. Elsewhere, collections have been based around his obsession with Japan, anime and the Brazilian mountains that were once his home. Also consistently on his mind are his two grandmothers, one of whom the brand takes its name from. “Both my grandmothers were seamstresses with their own ateliers,” he remembers. “I learned to sew when I was, like, six years old. Because of the carnivals in Brazil I made a lot of my own costumes for that. I never really imagined doing anything aside from fashion.” “I learned to sew when I was, like, six years old. Because of the carnivals in Brazil I made a lot of my own costumes for that. I never really imagined doing anything aside from fashion” – Francisco Terra His grandmother was the reason he moved to Paris in the first place, too. “She was super passionate about French fashion, and she particularly loved Givenchy. She used to make so many ‘Givenchy’ dresses for herself because they weren’t available in Brazil – or at least they were too expensive for her to buy,” Terra laughs. “She used to rip the pictures from magazines and make her own patterns. It was a dream of hers to come to France, which I feel like I’ve kind of carried with me.” With his grandmother firmly in mind, not only did Terra move to Paris, he also secured himself a position at her favourite fashion house, where he worked closely with Riccardo Tisci. His first job out of the city's Instituto Marangoni school, the role propelled him head-first into an industry he wasn’t always sure he could break into. “I don’t come from a rich family, so there was no way I could pay for school outright,” he explains. Instead, Terra “Googled where you could earn the biggest salaries in the world” and ended up moving to Geneva to work for the UN, making a series of films about the African textile industry and saving the money he made while there. As well as a stint at Givenchy, Terra honed his skills at both Raf Simons and Carven before setting out on his own. “Working at such different houses was great experience for me,” he says. “I learnt so much from each of them. Givenchy taught me the importance of creating a strong image and identity, while working with Raf and Serge (Ruffleux) at Carven reinforced how important construction and functionality are too.” Also important to Terra is the ongoing development of his aesthetic. “In my mind, every collection should be different from each other,” he explains. “They’re for different places and different moments in time, and I think maybe I’m slightly less scared than some designers to push the boundaries of what’s perceived as ‘consistent’. I don’t think that we as creatives need to stick to a single aesthetic. You know, the beauty of being in fashion is to be free and to showcase different things. Sometimes I feel that commerciality gets in the way of designers approaching fashion as the art form and means of expression it once was.” “I don’t think that we as creatives need to stick to a single aesthetic. You know, the beauty of being in fashion is to be free and to showcase different things. Sometimes I feel that commerciality gets in the way of designers approaching fashion as the art form and means of expression it once was” – Francisco Terra When it comes to where the designer wants his brand to go in the future, he has an ambitious but understated response. “I found it really hard moving to Paris, not knowing anyone, and not having doors immediately open for me. It was a huge risk stepping away from these huge houses and starting out on my own, but Neith Nyer started paying for itself like two seasons ago which was an amazing moment,” he explains. “Next up I want to grow the team because there’s only three of us working out of my studio in the 18th arrondissement – it’s been hard because I don’t want to take on interns if I can’t pay them.” On the other hand, when discussing the fame and fortune that being at the helm of a successful brand can bring, Terra is dismissive. “Those things are so abstract,” he says. “I guess they’ll come if they come. But most important to me is that myself and the people around me are happy and fulfilled. Everyone keeps telling me I’m too nice. Working in fashion is often perceived as being ‘glamorous’, but the most glamorous things in the world to me are love and kindness. They’re all too often overlooked in favour of ambition and getting ahead, and it’s about time that changed. Cheesy, right? But it’s true,” he laughs. @neithnyer

"Stockholm-hailed extraordinaire Erik Bjerkesjo is truly making waves on the design scene; his work consisting of considerations in men's shoes and menswear collections. After mastering advanced footwear design at Polimoda, Bjerkesjo began harnessing his talents to employ a contemporary twist on the classic Italian shoe design. For Erik Bjerkesjo, the devil really is in the detail, and this is evident in his SS14 showings. From the 18-carat gold seams, to the intricate engraved logo stamp immediately visible from a flick of the heel. Finishing touches even include magenta nail-polish that match the crisp palette of the collection, and which artfully offset the muted chocolates and ebonys of the footwear. Erik Bjerkesjo seems all too aware of the impact he is making, as he explains ""If you have new ideas and people are inspired by it, then you stay alive a little bit longer."" That a design can essentially immortalize you is a widely-covetable feat, and one that Bjerkesjo is slowly achieving, one step at a time.

"Lanvin has announced that Cannes-born couturier Bouchra Jarrar will be succeeding Alber Elbaz as its new artistic director. According to WWD, Jarrar will assume her role on Monday and present her first collection during the SS17 show season in September. “Joining Lanvin satisfies my desire to create and express myself in a space of larger expression,” Jarrar said in a statement, in which she also stated her intention to “bring to Lanvin the harmony and consistency of a fashion designed for women, a fashion of our time.” “Her timeless style is in keeping with the style and values of our company,” says Lanvin’s CEO Michèle Huiban. “Her talent, her high standards and her mastery of cuts and fabrics will bring a breath of freshness and modernity into the house, while respecting its soul as the oldest Paris couture house, a symbol of French elegance.” Lauded for her razor-sharp tailoring, Jarrar currently sits at the helm of her own eponymous couture house, which presents its collections at Paris’s Couture Fashion Week. She’s previously worked as studio director at Balenciaga (during Nicolas Ghesquière’s tenure) and as head of couture design for Christian Lacroix. The announcement comes just a week after Lanvin’s AW16 runway show – its first since Elbaz’s departure – which was not received favourably by critics.

"rag & bone’s website cites “British heritage” and an “understated New York aesthetic” as instrumental to their success, so who could be a more unlikely partner for their new capsule collection than the brash, controversial, and unequivocally American Eminem? In a collaboration only a little less unexpected than those Peppa Pig x Gucci ‘collabs’, the label is releasing the new collection comprised of three T-shirts – the Kamikaze, the Success, and the Grafitti, all co-designed by Eminem – and the aptly-named Icon hoodie, available in three colourways, to coincide with the latter end of his European ‘Revival’ tour. The designs themselves will incorporate nods to the rapper’s career, such as a lyric from Lose Yourself you wouldn’t want your grandma reading, and references to his Detroit hometown in the form of the area code “313”. It’s all made and manufactured in America, too, which Donald Trump would probably approve of if he wasn’t still recovering from Eminem’s savage freestyle from the end of last year (to which the Kamikaze t-shirt is a reference). This limited edition collection won’t be around for long, though; it will be available for one day only at London’s Sun and 13 Cantons pub on July 13th – you only get one shot, do not miss your chance etc, etc – along with, semi-unbelievably, Eminem’s famous ‘Mom’s Spaghetti’. Yes, there will be spaghetti and meatballs and spaghetti sandwiches that customers can sample while they shop. The pieces will also be released in limited batches on rag & bone’s website (minus spaghetti, unfortunately) beginning on the 14th, and can be previewed in cinematographer Darius Khondji’s teaser below.

"Is there anything Anna Wintour can’t do? In short – no. She appeared in the September Issue, as a comedienne alongside Seth Myers, and even reportedly rises at 5am every morning to play tennis before work. Now the Vogue editor appears on the cover of Business of Fashion’s latest print edition. Photographed by Patrick Demarchelier, Wintour appears in front of the stars and stripes for the America-dedicated issue. It isn't a first for ‘Nuclear Wintour’ – she previously appeared on Industrie magazine's debut cover. Why Wintour, you might wonder? Editor-in-chief Imran Amed puts it best in his editor’s letter: “If there was a president of fashion, it would certainly be Wintour, who gives us her take on the current American reality.” An industry veteran, Wintour joined Condé Nast in 1983 and was announced as artistic director for all of the titles owned by the media company in 2013. Next November marks her 30th year at the helm of America’s fashion bible. Not to mention the fact that Wintour has been a driving force in fashion’s political engagement, notably during the 2016 election, when Vogue endorsed a candidate for the first time ever. Following the election, Wintour met with Trump to discuss the future. “I hope that President-elect Trump will be a successful president for us all,” she said in a statement. Appearing as your newly inaugurated fashion President, the issue will look at some of America's most notable fashion brands – Calvin Klein (which Wintour wears on the cover), Coach, Diane von Furstenberg and Oscar de la Renta. For the full Wintour spread you’ll have to wait until 27th April when the issue comes out. In the meantime, watch her cameo on Late Night with Seth Myers below.

"Vivienne Westwood isn't messing about on fracking. The designer made a valiant attempt to ruin David Cameron's Christmas by delivering him a present of asbestos this morning, all to drive home the dangers of the controversial drilling technology. Westwood and her son, Agent Provocateur founder Joe Corré, showed up at 10 Downing Street with the holiday gift. They were accompanied by a Santa Claus wearing a gas mask. Why a box of asbestos? The government's chief scientist, Mark Walport, warned in a report this November that fracking could could carry potential public health risks in the way that asbestos did. This hasn't dented the government's enthusiasm for the drilling shale gas, with Cameron declaring ""the UK is going all out for shale"". ""David Cameron is happy playing Russian roulette with the lives of the British public,"" Westwood said. ""We’re all guinea pigs in David Cameron’s grand experiment with the lives of the British public."" Westwood's former partner and Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren died of cancer in 2010 after being exposed to asbestos in his Kings Road store, Sex. Unfortunately, police did not allow the festive asbestos through, although Westwood was able to deliver a Christmas letter from Talk Fracking, her lobbying group. The card was signed by Thom Yorke, Stella McCartney, Bianca Jagger, Sir Antony Gormley, Yoko Ono and 145 other supporters of the campaign. Read the full letter below: Dear David, Your Chief Scientific Advisor has given the clearest signal yet of extreme caution, highlighting how the dash for shale gas could end up being one of those gravely mistaken innovation choices, with disastrous medical and health consequences, like the push for Asbestos and Thalidomide a few decades ago. Considering the contents of this latest report from Professor Sir Mark Walport, we are sending you this festive gift. We also enclose some recent reports that show clear links between the fracking industry and birth defects, in addition to many other very serious health issues. Although you have no democratic mandate to foist fracking onto the British people, or to sweep away our protections under civil law in order to allow drilling companies to drill under our homes, schools and environment without our consent, this is precisely what you are doing. Please take some time over the festive period to consider the legacy that your decisions as Prime Minister will have on the British people and our green and pleasant land. We don’t want fracking to be the next Asbestos or Thalidomide, and we’re sure you wouldn’t want that on your hands either. Wishing you a merry Christmas Watch Vivienne Westwood talk about the dangers of fracking below:

"Ghana’s Food and Drugs Authority (FDA) has decided to ban the sale of cosmetics containing skin bleaching ingredient hydroquinone. According to reports, the ban will come into effect this August and aims to deter people from using products containing this substance, which is believed to have the potential to cause cancer. “Concerning skin lightening products, we are saying that from August 2016, all products containing hydroquinone will not be allowed into the country,” said FDA spokesperson James Lartey in an interview with Ghana Star. “From 2016, the acceptance for skin lightening products is going to be zero.” It is estimated that 30 per cent of women in Ghana use these products, such as Fair & Lovely, though rates are higher in other African nations. In Nigeria, for example, up to 77 per cent of women do so and in Senegal the figure is between 52 and 67 per cent. The use of skin lightening products is closely tied to notions of colourism, whereby women of lighter complexions are given better treatment and more opportunities than those with darker skin – something which stems from European colonialism and the globalisation of Western beauty ideals. However, these products have some side effects that include skin irritation and inflammation, a burning or stinging sensation and itchy and flaky skin, according to the NHS. Ghana isn’t the first country to ban their sale – cosmetics containing hydroquinone are already banned in the United States, Japan, Australia and the European Union.

"Italian fashion house Dolce & Gabbana is in hot water after a pair of shoes listed on their online boutique as “slave sandal in napa leather with pompoms”. Priced at £1,350, the shoes are decorated with multi-coloured pompoms, mirrors and gold trimming. Quite why the brand called the “slave sandal” remains unknown, though Footwear News suggested that the term is “a description for a particular lace-up shoe silhouette”, one which is now obsolete thanks to the less morally erroneous description “gladiator sandals”. Following a backlash on social media, the shoes have been relisted as “decorative flat sandal in napa leather with pompoms”. In 2010, Vogue Italia sparked a similar controversy after it published a feature on “slave earrings”. A gallery of several different styles of hoop earrings were accompanied by some text which referred to the “decorative traditions of the women of colour who were brought to the southern United States during the slave trade”. More recently, Valentino received criticism over its “wild, tribal Africa”-inspired SS16 show which saw a cast of predominantly white models come down the catwalk in cornrows, to the sound of bongos. We reached out to Dolce & Gabbana who declined to comment. h/t Footwear News

"After presenting his debut collection for Dior Men back in June, Kim Jones has now revealed his first campaign for the Parisian house. Photographed by Steven Meisel, the images are shot in front of a dusty pink background. Like the show itself, the images feature the giant sculptures created by artist Kaws – real name Brian Donnelly – which were made out of more than 70,000 flowers. Elsewhere, Prince Nikolai of Denmark – who opened the show – appears in the same blue and white striped suit he appeared on the runway in. “I wanted the advertising to reflect the spirit of the men’s summer show and the beauty of Dior,” Jones told WWD. “I’ve always wanted to work with Kaws, I think he’s super chic and also his work speaks to a lot of people.” The full campaign – featuring campaign video created by Jackie Nickerson – will debut on October 31.

"Taken from the autumn/winter 2018 issue of Dazed. You can buy a copy of our latest issue here. “People get so lost in the world. They are not in touch with everything they really are,” says Jaden Smith. We’re in New York, the 20-year-old’s adoptive city. It’s here where he filmed this summer’s Skate Kitchen, in which he appears as a skater who assimilates into an all-female skate crew – the only real actor in a group of newcomers. He also just released a new record, SYRE: The Electric Album, the first to be released in its entirety on Instagram. But speaking today, they all appear to be chapters within a bigger plan: to disappear into nature. Smith was 11 when he had his first big idea to save the planet: designing a sustainable water bottle. Back then, he quietly created JUST Water with his father, which bottles and distributes spring water in a low-impact way, all while acting in a reboot of The Karate Kid and After Earth. Now, nine years later, he has used this same approach to design a sustainable clothing line, linking up with G-Star RAW on clothes that take their design cues straight from the power of the planet as he sees it: extreme sandstorms and waterfalls might line the items, but the technology that dyes the blue denim requires 70 per cent less chemicals, meaning less risk for people and the environment. Wherever he flexes his muscle, Smith’s fans follow – but what they might not know is that soon he could be planning to go live in a forest and record his next album. As he would say: “super intense.” Why do you like nature? Jaden Smith: People think that we’re separate from nature, but we’re really still part of it. So I want to remind people that you need to go outside, that you need to experience real nature – because that’s where we really come from. But how do we get back to nature without completely ditching the societal constructs that we’re following? Jaden Smith: We need to have the societal constructs and evolve them, and also build structures that are indoor-outdoor and coincide with nature. Like, we can rebuild New York City to have not so much concrete. You could feel the ground more and the dirt. It’s just different ways of building in different styles of architecture – moving to the future. Your new collection has three insane prints. What’s the inspiration behind these? Jaden Smith: It’s mostly just nature and old hunting shirts. It’s like, the hunting glasses with the hunting shirts and the camo, and hunting prints. It’s a vibe that people have been on for a while, so I really wanted (my collection) to be another landmark in that genre of clothing. Did your dad have a stash of that kind of stuff in his closet? Jaden Smith: Not my dad, but definitely my friends’ grandpas, my friends’ dads. Or kids that tread around New York. They are dressed head to toe like a fuckin’ hunter. There’s something that is so fashionable (about it) – they are totally in another space. How did the design process work?I was working with the creative directors at G-Star RAW to look for things that we both could relate to. What I did design is the way that the pants are sewn together, the raw edge. When I actually sewed pants at G-Star, that’s how they came out. Then we took those pants and we made a blended vision between what I would do and what worked with G-Star. What does sustainability mean to you? Jaden Smith: It’s us being able to sustain a healthy world. Or to create a healthy world for (ourselves) before we can sustain it, because if we sustain what we have right now... that’s exactly what we’re not trying to do. So how does that process of sustainability figure into the 'Forces of Nature' collection? Jaden Smith: The way that the different denims are processed and dyed. Like, they have created a new indigo denim and a new type of dye presenting zero risk for people and the environment. What is the craziest experience you’ve ever had in nature? Jaden Smith: Snowboarding is really, really intense. Sometimes you feel like you catch so much air, you go so fast, you’re just zooming down the hill – that’s pretty intense. Or like, almost dying on a surfboard in the ocean. I was in Hawaii for my birthday, just surfing super-big waves. That’s just really intense, especially when there are other people out there. I like paddling in the ocean. Super intense. “I want to remind people that you need to go outside, that you need to experience real nature – because that’s where we really come from” — Jaden Smith And the most spectacular place you’ve been? Jaden Smith: Probably Hawaii or the mountains in China. Or Utah is really crazy, too. Even Italy. They’re all really, really, really beautiful. You’re like, kicking it with nature. I could walk a little bit and jump down right there and then I could be trapped in the middle of the wilderness. Or I could just spring in this direction and then if I looked around, I would see nothing. I would see no humans. I would only see nature. What’s stopping you from disappearing into nature? Does that appeal to you? Jaden Smith: For sure. Actually, nothing is stopping me from (doing) that. I’m just working my way up to that. I could be making albums from the forest. Do you paint? Jaden Smith: Yeah. It’s just like a bunch of words, all different types. I’m gonna do an art show. I have a really big painting in my room (where) I pretty much wrote down how I felt every day for a year on a huge canvas. So now it just looks like I’ve been trapped in my room for my whole life and I’ve only ever written on this one painting. It looks like someone got trapped in their room and went crazy. Like that Jim Carrey movie. Jaden Smith: It pretty much looks like that, The Number 23. I wrote “flex” on it somewhere. I’m gonna start selling my paintings. I already have. Everybody who buys my paintings, they never tell anyone. They never post about it. Who owns your paintings? Jaden Smith: I don’t know – seven people, but I have never met them. Who influences your sense of style? Jaden Smith: Honestly, (A$AP) Rocky and Tyler, the Creator. I usually go wild and say Poseidon and Sigmund Freud and shit but I’m gonna say Rocky and Tyler, the Creator. Tyler has definitely done a lot of things before everyone else. Even now. Everybody wants to wear pearls now, and his chains look like leaves. He’s crazy. But you’ve also famously championed gender-neutral dressing.People freaked out so many times. I was always like, (I’ll) do something and let people respond. It’s like, I’m gonna wait for another few years so people can get over it and then I can do something like that again. It’s just trying to show people the right direction, ‘cause everybody lives in a cage. It’s not about me. I’m just trying to help other people out, like, ‘Just so you know, you could do this too. This is available to you.’ When have people called you out for what you’ve worn?Every day. Every day I’m wearing something and somebody is like, ‘Oh my goodness, the shoes are too big,’ or something. That’s why I don’t post on Instagram because I don’t have time to read all these comments to understand what everybody feels. People know so much more about what people think they know about me, than I do. Have you ever reached out to anybody famous, just to meet someone? Jaden Smith: Well, I’d hit up Chris Pratt and be like, “I have a genius idea for me and you.” And then he’d be like, “Ah, what is it?” and then I’d be like, “Damn, I never thought that Chris Pratt would respond.” So I’d have to think of shit. Did that actually happen with Chris? Jaden Smith: Yeah. I still have to think of something to tell him. I have to tell him that I never thought Chris Pratt would respond. Freaking love Chris Pratt. What are you most excited about right now? Jaden Smith: I’m on tour with J Cole. I just announced it yesterday. And this collection comes out in October, so I’m really excited for that. I think a lot of my fans are going to be really happy that they can get it. Skate Kitchen is out in UK cinemas now. Syre: The Electric Album is out now too. Jaden Smith + G-Star RAW Forces of Nature collection is also out now.

"It’s kind of accepted that Miuccia Prada is fashion (feel free to @ us). As the celebrated mother of the Italian house, Mrs. P is essentially fashion’s oracle – looking into the future and making us want things we never thought we would. Take nylon for example (wtf?), or a quilted satin alice band, or a four-hundred pound mini backpack keychain. See? For a long time, fashion has been obsessed, rightfully, with Miuccia’s mind, so it was high time – in this age of ‘if you can name it, there’s an Instagram dedicated to it’ – we looked also to the wardrobe of the high priestess of fashion. Which is exactly what @whatmiuccia (short for What Miuccia Wore) is doing. An incredibly far-reaching wardrobe archive, scroll through the account’s feed and you’ll find 1997 Miuccia standing with an array of models and her intellectual countenance annotated with a detailed description of the collection from that year, plus the garment she’s wearing. Next up is Miuccia in the office, Miuccia on the phone, Miuccia drinking a glass of champagne, Miuccia in conversation with Cate Blanchett, and Miuccia’s feet in a pair of Prada pumps – what else would she be wearing exactly?! Essentially, it’s Miuccia heaven. Sadly, despite our IG DMs, our likes, and our bordering-on-needy comments on @whatmiuccia’s posts, whoever is behind the account has proven to be totally unreachable, and so its founder and their intentions remain a mystery. One post, however, features a quote from the legendary Katie Grand, which pretty much sums things up: “Once, she was standing in the studio in this very prim, calf-length, pleated white dress, and you could see straight through it to her electric pink underwear. I don’t know if she knew it was transparent or not, but that mixture of being sober and conservative and then something quite shocking is totally Prada and totally her. It’s an unseen sexiness that’s completely instinctive.” @whatmiuccia offers a look at someone whose clothes are a barometer for where style is. It’s a series of snapshots of the person whose instincts define our own sartorial choices. And if this collection of images of Miuccia prove anything, it’s that nine times out of ten those instincts are utterly perfect.

"It was only a few months ago that husband and wife design duo Luke and Lucie Meier presented their debut collection for Jil Sander. Now, the SS18 collection has been presented in a series of films directed by Wim Wenders. Wenders – known for films Wings of Desire and Paris, Texas – worked with the design pair to film the five trailers entitled “Paused By”. Showcasing pieces from the new collection, each of the short films is stopped at a key moment to keep you guessing about what could happen next. The first of the films sees a variety of well-dressed individuals around different locations in Berlin, before pausing at the moment a scuba diver is emerging out of a lake. Who knows what happens next... According to the pair, the campaign was “an ode to the purity of emotion and the delicate balance between innocence and sophistication”, similar to the overall message of the collection that saw a return to the hyper-minimal roots of the house. The series of films will be released throughout December. Watch the trailer below.

"Fresh from unveiling its frenzy-inducing collaboration with skate brand Supreme at the men’s AW17 show in Paris, Louis Vuitton has revealed its next limited-edition partnership. Contemporary artist Jeff Koons – known for his famous balloon animals, NSFW works featuring adult actress ex-wife Ilona Staller, and for rendering Michael Jackson and his pet monkey in white and gold porcelain – is creating a series of bags for the house. The Koons-created line is a reimagining of his well-known ‘Gazing Ball’ series, a collection of art history replicas including famous paintings and sculptures which feature a blue mirrored ball intended to be looked into (you might remember the time Koons recreated Lady Gaga as a sculpture with such a ball for her album Artpop). For the capsule, dubbed ‘Masters’, Van Gogh’s “Wheat Fields and Cypresses”, Rubens’ “Tiger Hunt”, and Da Vinci’s “Mona Lisa” are among the works which appear on bags. Like a super high-end version of something you might find peddled outside the Louvre, they brilliantly capture Koons’ mastery of kitsch and artistic appropriation – he’s even been allowed to design a take on the signature LV monogram with his own initials. No stranger to collaborations, Louis Vuitton is known for enlisting artists to work on creative projects, with names like Cindy Sherman, Takashi Murakami and Richard Prince having previously put their name to products. Stephen Sprouse’s graffiti inspired bags and Yayoi Kusama’s dotty offerings are some of the best-known projects for the house, while in 2014 they opened the Fondation Louis Vuitton museum in Paris. The ‘Masters’ collection will be available from April 28th, and marks the first stage of a long-running collaboration between Louis Vuitton and Jeff Koons so keep an eye out for future announcements.

"Unless you’ve been living under a rock – or perhaps, more appropriately, you’ve already retreated to your underground bunker – you’ll probably have noticed that much of Europe is anxiously enjoying a pretty unseasonable heatwave (although that might be an understatement). Meanwhile last week, in the Arizona Desert, actual snow fell. In the desert. Let that sink in. The effects of climate change are becoming more and more evident with each passing year, as ice caps melt, heatwaves become more and more frequent, and freak weather incidents continue to occur on an ever-increasing basis. It makes sense, then, that a new generation of fashion designers are waking up to the impact the industry has on the planet, and setting out to make a change. Enter: Marine Serre. The Paris-based designer, who cut her teeth at Balenciaga before going it alone with her eponymous label, has made a name for herself as one of the most exciting talents working in fashion today – with her dynamic and sustainably focused FutureWear, much of which is made using entirely recycled and reworked materials. Following on from last season, when she presented a collection crafted from bed sheets and silk scarves, at her AW19 show PFW this morning Serre sent out a post-apocalyptic offering – entitled Radiation – designed with the all-too-real possibility of the end of the world in mind. Making their way through the UV-lit, labyrinthine corridors of a cellar deep below the French capital’s streets, models wore full crescent-moon printed bodysuits that covered their entire faces, quilted fluorescent jackets, dresses, and trousers, as well as some pretty serious-looking breathing masks, which at first glance added to the overall #aesthetic (and subsequent IG posts), until the reality quickly sank in that it’s likely designers really will have to start incorporating items like this into their collections in the not-so-distant years to come. Elsewhere, garments were embellished with shells, coins, and computer chips, in reference to future-found artefacts of the world we once knew. As we race at an incomprehensible pace towards a reality unknown, Serre continues to lead the way in imagining how the future might look for fashionable citizens of the planet – a future that, if we don’t get our acts together fast, is coming sooner than we think.

"Fashion’s polarising ability to turn things that sound completely wrong on paper into must-have items is nothing new. Thigh-high Ugg boots? Fashion crocs? Check and check. Two photographers have gone one step further in pushing fashion’s (sometimes) ridiculous boundaries, though, by creating a stylist that doesn’t really exist. Yep, if you’ve ever heard the name Clifford Jago, or come across his work, he’s not real. Self-described as “The Messiah of the fashion cupboard, balancing objects on humans in the name of fashion” Jago was first created by the duo – who have chosen to remain anonymous, and go by the aliases Mario Leibovitz and Juergen Penn – back in 2015 as a reaction to ‘credit culture’ and the fact that magazines have to shoot brands simply because they advertise. The end result – that Jago (yes, he answers questions) describes as “something that would confuse your mum, but make her smile” – is surprisingly captivating. Ditching hair and make-up and “traditional” styling, the images often feature looks completely created out of items found on the street, or bought second-hand. While banana cones, inflatable pool toys, pop-up tents, and spears of asparagus might not sound like your typical fashion looks, the playfulness and light-hearted approach creates beautiful images enhanced by the breathtaking backdrops. “(I’m) the Messiah of the fashion cupboard, balancing objects on humans in the name of fashion” – Clifford Jago First heading to Amsterdam to create his debut book Clifford and the Tulip Chewers, Jago is now back after a sojourn to Iceland for his second project, Clifford Jago & The Ice Queens. “It’s an adventure on another planet, only NASA is easyJet and the spacesuits are bananas,” the stylist explains. “Every single page is a banger, I believe each image should be able to stand alone on its own and have a little party.” Published by Catalogue, the sophomore edition evolves from the analogue style of the first, and includes digitally-created images – yes, that’s more CGI models. While it might seem like a poke at fashion (and some of its diva attitudes) the pair behind Jago are adamant it’s not, with the overall message being about collaboration across creative jobs and not being so rigid in approach. “I don’t think you have to be so protective over your role,” they say. “A lot more possibilities can happen if you’re collaborating.” Here, we speak to the duo behind Clifford Jago. How did you first meet? Mario Leibovitz: We both used to work at a studio called Curtain Road Studios. It closed down two years ago but it was the best daylight going. Juergen worked there before me and I met him through a mutual friend who told me I should work at the studio as well. And then you started shooting together? Mario Leibovitz: We started hanging out and doing a few tests to see what we could do. We used to do all these mad shoots with no concept, just going wild and then it eventually led to something pretty solid. We met up on weekends and just set stuff up with smoke machines, dry ice machines, and abandoned radiators. We had a contact at The Sun newspaper and they sent us this glamour model, so we shot her on top of eight piled-up radiators and she was like ‘what the fuck are you guys doing?’. She completely freaked out, but we really enjoyed it and had a laugh with her. We were just experimenting with stuff and basically trashed the studio, then spent hours cleaning it up. Where did you get the clothes from? Juergen Penn: We’d go down to the local vintage shops. There were two different fashion shops and we’d just go in there and ask if we could borrow some clothes. Mario Leibovitz: We were quite naughty. All the PR clothes in the office, we used to use them on the side then put them back really neatly. We’d have the biggest brands and then we’d mix them with broken radiators, and go to the garage downstairs and see what we could find down there. How did the idea to create Clifford Jago come about? Mario Leibovitz: He was first created as a reaction to the fashion formula of the industry because we felt restricted by magazine requirements. What the stylist would want from the shoot would often conflict with what we wanted. There would be loads of arguments, so we needed to make our own platform to break free from that. When we were shooting it was always a no-go for the photographer to jump in and start making styling decisions. We wanted to start doing that, but also have this alter-ego that would allow us a bit of freedom, but anonymously. The character is a hyperreal, super-charged stylist that is a little mad, a bit eccentric, but also doesn’t have to go down the credit route – just total freedom. “The Sun newspaper sent us this glamour model, so we shot her on top of eight piled-up radiators and she was like ‘what the fuck are you guys doing?’” – Mario Leibovitz Who inspires his character? Mario Leibovitz: We originally modelled Jago on Cain Dingle from Emmerdale. We modelled it on him because he’s got that real sort of ‘fuck you, I’m doing it’ approach and there’s something about that which is just great. We wanted to combine the personality of a fashion stylist but bring it all back down to earth. As we did it, it became less about Jago’s character and more about the Instagram presence of Jago. Juergen Penn: When we spoke to Catalogue (the publisher) we sent them a whole bunch of memes that we had made through the humour of Clifford Jago, to try and get his personality across. We definitely think about how the character exists and how he thinks and that plays a big part in the styling. What does he look like? Mario Leibovitz: Imagine Cain Dingle with pink hair, or Cain Dingle but he looks like Mugatu from Zoolander. I reckon if we gave Cain Dingle a bit of money he’d be well up for it. What was the reaction to your first book, Clifford Jago and the Tulip Chewers? Juergen Penn: We got into a bit of trouble with it. We went to Amsterdam and hooked up with a load of agencies there, shooting with their models, but we didn’t really have a lot of stuff to show them previously. They were really shocked when they saw the result, a bit freaked out. So we upset a few agencies there. Mario Leibovitz: We came up with this massive concept and in our heads it makes sense, but to other people it was like ‘what the hell is going on here?’ As we were doing the book we were still discovering what the hell it was. The difference now is we know what it is and it comes across that way. With the first book, it was about perfecting the style, seeing how it works. Do you think people now understand the message behind it? Juergen Penn: This one was a lot easier because we already had one book when we went to Iceland, so people straight away knew what to expect. Having done it before it’s slightly more refined and people are understanding what we’re trying to do now. We’re growing in a good way. Mario Leibovitz: The good thing about this project is that it’s accessible to everyone. You don’t have to be on the inside to get it, even though it’s keeping in the DNA of fashion. Juergen Penn: It works because we’ve both been through the industry, we both learnt our trade, so it’s a ‘learn the rules to break rules’ kind of thing. It’s very accessible, but above anything it’s playful, it’s visually fun, and you can read into it or not. “The good thing about this project is that it’s accessible to everyone. You don’t have to be on the inside to get it, even though it’s keeping in the DNA of fashion” – Mario Leibovitz Why did you choose Iceland for the second book? Juergen Penn: We wanted somewhere that was a mad landscape to try and test ourselves and make a book that feels like you’re on Mars. There was a lot of driving around in campervans, and it’s just barren, cold landscapes for miles and miles. Mario Leibovitz: The thing with Iceland, because a lot of people have been in recent years on different excursions and photo trips, we wanted to include the side of it that no one wants to put on their Facebook feeds. The more everyday side of it. That was a big thing as well, putting the mundane in there: a vending machine, some old lady in a car park, a supermarket. I think it’s important for us to experience a bit of everything and bring it all into the mix. Magical realism. Did you take styling items with you, or find things when you were out there? Mario Leibovitz: It was a bit 50/50 with this one because when you’re out there you’re really limited. We picked up a bunch of stuff before we went, we also found stuff en route. There’s a banana cone we got from Luton airport, that was a great little find. We did a shop when we got there and went around the town, picked up some stuff. Went to some hardware stores, we went to different shopping centres and found materials while we were there. How do you plan to continue Clifford’s story? Mario Leibovitz: We’ve had a few ideas, we want to do a few special collaborations. Things like calendars, maybe collaborate with a model agency or a magazine, and then we also thought about doing our own fashion show. We’d actually make the outfits and then while fashion week was going on we’d put on a Clifford Jago thing, at the main event or in a big lorry. It can transform into anything, that’s the beautiful thing about this. It can be a design, a magazine, a video game, we don’t even know what it could be yet, it’s ever-transforming. We’re just having fun with it at the moment. It’s more of an art piece. We will definitely do another adventure abroad somewhere, but I think we’re going to do some smaller stuff between and gear up to the next big trip. We were going to do a whole book and document the banana, from the banana plantation in South America all the way back to London. We thought that would be amazing, because a banana is kind of our spirit animal. There’s just so many things you could do with a banana, there are so many ways of styling with a banana. It’s a hilarious object. It’s a metaphor for madness. Do people think Clifford is real? Mario Leibovitz: We try to keep it a big secret, but the more we do it the more we find it just confuses people. When we go to see agencies and magazines we have to give the game away a bit and say there’s this imaginary character. The people outside of that bubble though, they have no idea and it’s important it stays like that. Of we put our names on it, it would be distracting. It’s cool just being Clifford Jago. It doesn’t matter if people think it’s real or not. @cliffordjago

"Ahead of its AW18 show – that will take place on February 21 – Gucci has dropped its pre-fall 2018 campaign. After taking us into outer space for AW17 and to Rome for Cruise 2018, the latest images reimagine the student awakening of 60s Paris. The social revolution saw the young generation rebel against traditional institutions and values – expressing their dissatisfaction through music, literature, political ideologies and activism. Shot by long-term collaborator Glen Luchford, the images reenact the starting point of the revolution, when students marched on the Sorbonne University. In the accompanying video, a group of students – all in Gucci, naturally – are seen occupying a university campus, while having political meetings, marching in the schoolyard, and spray-painting the walls with verses by poet Rimbaud. The words Liberté, égalité, sexualité – a message of love, not hate – also appear. After a busy year that earned it the title of hottest fashion brand of 2017, Alessandro Michele doesn’t show any signs of slowing down. Aside from the fast-approaching co-ed show, Michele recently announced that he would be designing the costumes for Elton John’s farewell tour. Watch the campaign video below:

"Cast your mind back to last summer, when Alessandro Michele, a cast of models, and shedloads of beautifully eccentric clothes arrived in London for the Westminster Abbey Cruise show. The show (and afterparty) were obviously epic, but other than the subculture-inspired collection, there was something altogether more unexpected that made it one to remember. No, it wasn’t the surprise will.i.am headphone collab – obviously, I'm talking about the free cushions (fabulous tasseled velvet things embroidered with various Gucci motifs) that the guests got to take home. Mine, FYI, has a felt panther on it, and woe on the house guest who actually tries to sit on such a precious souvenir. Luckily for those who weren’t at the show, Gucci has realised that such swag should not be the preserve of a select few. Today, it has announced the launch of Décor: a new range of suitably swanky home furnishings. From cushions to candles, chairs to silken wallpaper, the new collection is the perfect way to Guccify your house, and will be available from September with prices starting from £150. Unsurprisingly, the designs pull from Michele’s catwalk archives – incorporating prints, patterns and icons borrowed from his own collections and reimagined for furniture and homewares. As Gucci puts it: “The overall effect is one of a surprising, joyous combination of hue, pattern and design, where there are no rules.” We’ll take one of everything, thx.

"The latest polls might be too close to call, but Vivenne Westwood has issued a passionate call for Scottish independence. In a new video, she urged Scottish voters to tick 'yes' in this Thursday's referendum, telling them to ""break the deadlock and march into the future"". In a video message, she said: ""In England there is hardly any democracy left. The government does what it wants. That which should belong to people – it gives it all to business, e.g. they’re prepared to poison our water so that businesses can frack."" ""The most important thing I have to say is that after 300 years, the capitalist system is now at an end. It’s over. Yet the English government – all main parties – want to drag us down with it. We want Scotland to break the deadlock and march into the future.""""We English have to fight our government. You, Scotland, can have the government you want."" Westwood was born and bred in Derbyshire, but clearly feels passionately about Scotland going independent. In the Red Label show last night, she sent models down the runway with 'YES' badges and took her bows wearing one herself. You can read our full runway report here. The English designer's name is now trending on Twitter for comments she made after her SS15 show. ""I hate England,"" she told the Independent. ""I like Scotland because somehow I think they are better than we are. They are more democratic."" Some Twitter users have slammed her for the statements, with one even calling for her to be ""exiled"" and others calling for her to give back her damehood: Westwood is one of the few fashion designers to support the split. Scottish designers Christopher Kane and Jonathan Saunders have all come out against independence, with Kane signing a letter that calls for Scotland to remain part of Great Britain.

"Dries Van Noten is arguably one of the greatest fashion designers working today. One of the ‘Antwerp Six’ who turned fashion upside-down in 1986, he’s since found acclaim for his fabrics and for using techniques from all over the world – be it India, Morocco or Eastern Europe. Season after season, his collections bring together impossibly rich combinations of colour and pattern. Now a documentary about the designer is on the way. Titled Dries, the film will focus on Van Noten’s career – from when he started in the late 80s, after graduating from the fashion design course of Antwerp’s Royal Academy, right up to the present day. According to Variety, Dries will feature interviews with the designer and his team, in addition to style icon Iris Apfel, fashion critic Suzy Menkes and Pamela Golbin, who is the chief curator of fashion and textiles at the Musée des Arts Décoratifs in Paris. While a release date has not yet been set, it is understood that the film will be directed by Reiner Holzemer – the filmmaker behind the 2008 documentary about American photographer William Eggleston, William Eggleston: Photographer. News of the title comes amid a slew of fashion-related films; movies about Alexander McQueen and Gianni Versace are on the way, while a documentary about Cara Delevingne is also said to be in the works.

"Check out the full Class of 2016, in collaboration with Luxottica, here. Hari Nef, Iris Apfel and Rejjie Snow. One an actress (among other things); one a style icon; and one a rapper. These three people come from disparate worlds and, in fact, generations but eyewear company Luxottica has brought them together for its ‘Class of 2016’ campaign, along with photographer Gray Sorrenti, model Mae Lapres and Instagram It-boy Mike the Ruler. Together, they prove that glasses are an every-season accessory. Based around the idea of a yearbook, the campaign sees these six talents – photographed by Fumi Nagasaka and styled by Dazed’s senior fashion editor Elizabeth Fraser-Bell – portrayed as different high school stereotypes. Hari plays the role of teacher (just check out her Twitter / recent interview with Dazed to see how smart she is), while 95-year-old style maverick Iris plays the rebel. “I think all the fashion rules are stupid, because it depends upon who’s wearing it and how they handle it!” she says. “And I don’t like rules because I think they’re there to be broken. People should be original, and try.” Don’t let the tattoos deceive you – as one of rap’s best wordsmiths, Reggie is the nerd. “I would definitely describe myself as a perfectionist,” he says. “But sometimes it gets a bit too much cause it has to be so perfect, to the point where it could be perfect and I’ll just keep on going with it. I could keep on going with it until it’s nothing.” An artist and nature lover, Gray is cast as the dreamer; French-Canadian-Chinese beauty, Mae as the prom queen (naturally); and Mike the Ruler, as his name might suggest, as the class president. With this concept in mind, it made sense for Nagasaka to shoot this campaign in an IRL high school – and that’s exactly what she did, taking the cast to a school in New Jersey and shooting them in its classrooms, canteen and gym. Head to the gallery above to see the campaign, and to the one below to see some Polaroids taken behind the scenes.

"Last year, Australian model Gemma Ward ended a six year hiatus from the runway when she opened Prada's SS15 show. It was a huge moment for both the brand and Ward, representing a move back into a career she'd seemingly shelved in favour of film. At the time, legendary make up artist Pat McGrath Instagramed a picture of Ward backstage calling her ""beautiful and iconic"", and the fashion world celebrated the return of one of a much-loved model. Now, Prada has released an intimate video of Ward backstage at SS15, soundtracked beautifully by piano and strings. The film acts as a candid glimpse into Ward's psyche and doesn't seek to shy away from any truth. In it Ward appears vulnerable, at times frozen, before ending with a her relaxed and happy, quite the mixture of emotions for a film only half a minute long.

"Whether it’s the horror movie malice of Berberian Sound Studio or The Duke of Burgundy’s Fassbinder-esque jealousy and desire, Peter Strickland’s films use the darker depths of human emotion as cinematic canvas. In the British director’s latest effort, In Fabric, this cruelty is projected onto a deceptively innocuous red dress. Like a thoroughly wicked version of the jeans from the Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants, the garment miraculously fits and flatters anyone who wears it – but wreaks havoc on their lives shortly after. Whilst its sartorial plot device bears some similarities to this cookie-cutter teen movie, it’s stylistic antecedents can be found in Italian Giallo. In much the same way that horror flicks from the likes of Dario Argento do, In Fabric combines a sensual atmosphere with unexpected flashes of intense gore. Aside from Giallo, Strickland details his other aesthetic referents as ranging from old shopping catalogues and Serbian performance artist Katalin Ladik, to ASMR videos on YouTube. “We spent a lot of time discussing the style of the dress and what era it should be from. In the end the classic wraparound shape, cinched at the waist, that was found in the 50s and 70s seemed to be right” – Jo Thompson The carnival-esque department store where the unsuspecting Sheila (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) first encounters the demonic dress, meanwhile, has a more singular inspiration: Jacksons of Reading, a historic department store which closed in 2013. With its mishmash of Edwardian architecture and 70s interiors, Strickland describes the Jacksons shopping experience as being akin to “stepping back in a time capsule” – a sensation that is reflected in the film’s collage of different time periods. Naturally for a film that places so much power in an item of clothing, one of In Fabric’s focal points is its costume design. Whether it’s the frilly embellishments of the shop girls’ Victorian frocks or the supple, silky folds of the murderous red dress, each wardrobe choice has been meticulously planned right down to the last, minute detail. Ahead of its UK launch on June 28, here we speak to In Fabric’s costume designer Jo Thompson, whose previous work includes cult classic This Is England and Channel 4’s Glue, about Giallo, the psychology of shopping, and making a horror villain out of an inanimate red dress. What were the inspirations that fed into your work on In Fabric? Jo Thompson: Peter (Strickland) gave me a very comprehensive list of films to watch and music to listen to. I spent ages absorbing myself into his world and I loved it, particularly films like Carnival Of Souls, all the Giallo films and Anna Biller’s film The Love Witch. In terms of fashion, I referenced Halston, Ralph Lauren, Jacques Fath, and Calvin Klein. Like Peter, I’d also been to Jacksons as a child – it was full of old glass cabinets and you felt like you’d suddenly stepped back in time. There was a formality about the way people addressed you. Everyone seemed quite odd, especially for me being a child, and obviously for Peter too. Peter Strickland’s work is often likened to the Giallo horror genre – what would you say has been the lasting impact of the genre on fashion? Did Giallo influence your choices at all? Jo Thompson: I think the drama of Giallo films was a huge influence, as well as the fact that everything is symbolic and heightened. There’s also a sensuality about the clothes (in Giallo) that’s dramatic and alluring. What was your process like for working on the film? Jo Thompson: I spent hours collecting photographs and paintings that felt right for the tone of the film. I also sourced magazines like Vogue, Nova, and Elle and Littlewoods and Freemans shopping catalogues from the 70s and 90s, as well as paper dress patterns from the same periods. My team and I then trawled through costume houses for relevant and inspiring pieces from different eras that felt right for the film. We built up a stock of underwear, utility wear, hats, coats, and gloves that we constantly referenced, and the whole process was actually quite organic. The red dress was a mixture of my design and a lot of draping sessions on a mannequin to get the right shape and proportions. The dress and its duplicates, as well as Gwendoline Christie’s lingerie, were couture, as made by Kasia Chojnowska. The cinematography in the film picks up every tiny detail in each shot, paying particular attention to the texture of fabric. Did this impact on your decisions when working on the film? Jo Thompson: I knew Peter wanted a very visceral, textural feel to the film, so everything was very considered. With the dress we tested lots fabrics and different colour reds that would enhance the sumptuousness of the dress and it’s softness, which belied its ultimate menace. The font and design of the embroidery on the dress were painstakingly worked on within my department and that of the graphic designer Flo Hickson, it had to look wound-like and arterial. How did you settle on the particular form the red dress takes? Jo Thompson: We spent a lot of time discussing the style of the dress and what era it should be from. In the end the classic wraparound shape, cinched at the waist, that was found in the 50s and 70s seemed to be right. It also had to be flattering on different sizes and body shapes and genders. We used a beautiful natural sheer silk which was very luxe and wafted and waned as it was dropped. It had to be light so it caught the air to add mystery and had something ghostly about it. Initially Peter visualised the dress as white so that when the victims died the embroidery (which functions symbolically like a wound) would bleed. Why did it eventually become red, then? Jo Thompson: I felt it needed to be something much stronger and red seemed the natural choice, it created a sense of drama and was always visible to the audience – wherever it was hiding. I usually avoid red as it can be a very unstable colour on camera, so for me it was quite exciting and unknown. There had to be something sexual and alluring about the dress; it had to be very seductive and feminine. Of course, red is symbolically a signpost for danger. I felt the dress had to be a strong, recognisable character in its own right – we even gave it a cast number! “There had to be something sexual and alluring about the dress; it had to be very seductive and feminine. Of course, red is symbolically a signpost for danger. I felt the dress had to be a strong, recognisable character in its own right – we even gave it a cast number!” – Jo Thompson There’s also a mix of different time periods in the costumes. Sheila and the characters in her direct vicinity wear very contemporary clothes but the department store workers are wearing Victorian-style outfits, and some of the extras seem to be wearing kind of retro clothes. Could you talk more about this? Jo Thompson: I wanted the costumes to have a dream-like quality, where they embodied different periods, so it was more about silhouette and colour rather realism. My ambition was to evoke a timeless and ambiguous quality with the costumes, so that nothing fits into a specific period. It was a mish-mash of Victorian and 1930s-1990s fashion, as though the demonic dress had affected many people through the ages for a long, long time. I worked very closely with Emma Scott, the make-up designer, on all of the characters’ looks. This was hugely satisfying as we just went along with what felt right for each scene – we weren’t locked in by an era. The costumes for the end scene were reminiscent of 1930s factory workers as a visual comment on the constant mass production that goes into the making of beautiful clothes, which is so far removed from the people who actually make the garments. (You could say) these people are literally having the blood sucked out of them, whilst being trapped in inescapable situations. Something about the film that is quite interesting is how it explores the emotional impact of clothing and retail – the elation and escapism of a new purchase, and then the very visceral ‘comedown’ you sometimes have when you take it home and it doesn’t look as good as you hoped. Jo Thompson: Yes, that’s a very literal translation about shopping that I think Peter was trying to convey. (Lead character) Sheila pins all her hopes on a new dress, hoping it will secure the love she is so clearly looking for, which she thinks will change her dreary life for the better. It then seems all the more tragic as the audience knows that the dress will be her undoing. The film seems to have quite an anti-consumerist message but it really taps into fashion as a vehicle that permits a lot of fantasy – even if in this context it’s channelled into horror. How did you reflect this in the costume? Jo Thompson: The original script was called In Fabric – A Ghost Story, so I was trying to create a very fluid, dream-like environment with a neutral canvas for all the weirdness, so that the dress would stand out. I was very interested in silhouettes as that’s how we sometimes remember things in dreams and I wanted to create a timelessness; something that would linger in the memory. The shop assistants came from discussions with Peter wanting something otherworldly and I felt something gothic and extraordinary would make the audience believe them to be witches or ghosts, something indefinable. We gave them earrings made out of hair and chatelaines so that there was something quite disturbing about them visually. In Fabric is released in the UK on June 28.

"Where teens once spent ten minutes daubing pearlescent shadow on their lids and acid bright blush on their cheeks, before finishing everything off with one too many sticky layers squeezed out of prized, Juicy-emblazoned tubes, in 2019 they’re skipping the awkward phase and instead landing in straight-up supermodel territory. Following the rise of the YouTube make-up tutorial, kids around the world are baking, bronzing, and contouring – and becoming flawless, carbon copies of one another. “It’s never been about that for me, I want people to have fun with make-up and experiment with their identity,” explains Thomas de Kluyver, the wildly talented make-up artist making a case for something altogether more unusual. A rising star in the realm of high fashion, de Kluyver has created unique looks for rising stars Rokh, Asai, and Sies Marjan, and collaborated with everyone from Simone Rocha and Gucci to Chanel and Chalayan. Given that he’s also a much-loved member of the Dazed family, having been appointed contributing beauty editor last year, his work has graced the pages of more issues of the magazine than we’re able to even remember. In de Kluyver’s masterful hands, skin is often buffed, clean, and bare – with pores and so-called imperfections left defiantly on show – as flashes of bold colour are smeared across cheeks and eyes, lashes are extended to unfathomable, outlandish lengths, and lips are circled with chalky-bright pencils and paint. It’s about being raw, and experimental, and free. Now, de Kluyver is set to launch his first ever book, All I Want To Be, as published by creative powerhouse IDEA. The result of six months spent flying around the world, landing as far as LA and Tokyo, and as close to home as Clapton, East London, All That I Want To Be comprises six different shoots, and far too many beautiful images to fit into a zine, which was the initial plan. “It wasn’t meant to be anywhere near as extensive as this,” he laughs. “I just kept meeting up with friends and we were coming up with all these ideas, and it just kept snowballing until it ended up being 150 pages!” “There’s a beautiful poem by Wilson Oryema at the beginning of the book, which really sums it up I think. It talks about how our identities are never fixed, or set, and how important it is to be able to express ourselves the way we want to” – Thomas de Kluyver Among these friends were the likes of Harley Weir, Lea Colombo, Sharna Osborne, Fumiko Imano, Fran Burns, and Haley Wollens, all of whom de Kluyver has forged strong creative bonds with having joined forces with each previously. It’s perhaps these relationships which add to the overarchingly intimate feeling of the book, as de Kluyver and his collaborators lens a series of young people exploring their identity and gender, as they try to work out, as the name of the book suggests, exactly who they are and what they want to be. “There’s a beautiful poem by Wilson Oryema at the beginning of the book, which really sums it up I think,” explains de Kluyver. “It talks about how our identities are never fixed, or set, and how important it is to be able to express ourselves the way we want to. Our starting point for All I Want To Be was making sure we captured the people that feature in it somewhere they felt safe. So many of the images are shot in bedrooms, bathrooms... The kind of places we’re able to shut the door and experiment with who we are freely and without any judgement.” Among those photographed are a group of teens, whose skin is punctuated by spots and teeth are smeared with lipstick. Lensed by Oliver Hadlee Pearch, the shoot is a tender celebration of adolescence and awkwardness: “And one of my favourite things is seeing blemishes, and scars, and whatever other flaws people might have. I understand why kids want to cover them up, but I think they’re beautiful and fascinating.” Also featured are a series of haphazardly painted skater boys, shot by Sharna Osborne, and portraits of Fumiko Imano which riff on her ongoing series ‘Twins”. Perhaps the most provocative of all the works included in All I Want To Be, though, is its closing shoot. Photographed by Harley Weir in a Tokyo hotel room, Shibuya documents a number of Japanese women lying, for the most part, in the bath. Naked but for lurid pink and orange body paint, iridescent glitter, and Geisha-inspired make-up, the flesh and folds of each woman’s body are brought into sharp relief. Presented against the backdrop of a society that determines a woman’s value based on the thinness of her waist, the gap between her thighs, and how desirable she is when placed in front of a man Shibuya explores and brings into focus an alternative, with the resulting images defiant, challenging, and tender at the same time. Touchingly, at the end of our conversation, de Kluyver reveals he will be donating his share of the proceeds from All I Want To Be to Mermaids UK. Given the themes of the book, it’s a fitting choice: the charity supports gender-diverse and transgender children and their familiies throughout adolescence. “It was really important to me to do this,” says de Kluyver. “Growing up in Perth, I came out quite young, and while I was lucky to be surrounded by people who supported me, I knew plenty of gay and trans kids who didn’t have that. What Mermaids are doing is so vital. It felt like the perfect fit.” All I Want To Be is released on May 16 at IDEA Books, Dover Street Market.

"When Lana Del Rey declared that she ‘climbed up the H of the Hollywood sign’, she wasn’t kidding. Since her rebirth as Lana – after she ditched her Lizzie Grant roots – the songstress has been obsessed with California and Hollywood. So it’s no surprise that the obsession quickly spilled over into her outfits too. Take her breakout persona: a forceful femme fatale siren, with rose-crowned wild red hair, satin-slips, and pouty red lips. In short – the dark vision of allure and Americana. But her romanticism has been continually re-fashioned, blossoming from throwback-belle to ruler of retromania. Leather jackets, blue jeans and white shirts defined her age of Ultraviolence: a sad-girl with an ethereal style covered the heated hits of Honeymoon, while white lace and daisies breathed fresh summer air into Lust for Life. Her overarching image? An East-Coast born but West-Coast at heart woman with an effortlessness that matches her melancholic music. Six years on and five studio albums later, Rey continues to flourish through fashion. There are no dull episode in her sartorial saga – from dark heroine capes to floral 60s frocks – and magnetism always pervades. The 2018 series? Her regal charm blossoms even more, thanks to her (heart eyes) friendship with Alessandro Michele, who has cast her the role of a Gucci Goddess. As the singer turns 33 today, we look back at her myriad style incarnations and chart how she became the fashioned Queen of Hollywood. Back in the Born to Die days, LDR’s star status began with her stylised odes to nationalism. Watch her “National Anthem” video, and you’ll see her emerge in a homage to Jackie Kennedy. Babydoll dresses and bouffant hair – the queen of Hollywood was born. And with it, old glamour reigned on. VERDICT: He said to be cool, but she’s already coolest. Continuing with her modern femme fatale status, Rey served on the front row of the Versace AW13 show in a look designed to break hearts: all in black, in a tux blazer with lace detailing in just right places. Daringly chic? Definitely – but she didn’t stop there, topping off the look with knee high leather boots and a signature red lip. VERDICT: Channel the cherry. We all know that LDR is the ultimate singer of seduction – longing and lovestruck lyrics govern her songs. It’s all video games really, but that’s never stopped her from playing. And from the frontline of fashion, it looks like she’s won. The oh-so-Lana style was set when she stole her beau’s basics: leather motorcycle jackets, white tees, and blue jeans throw endless shades of cool. VERDICT: This is how you do it down on the West Coast. When LDR’s “Young and Beautiful” was released as part of the soundtrack to The Great Gatsby in 2016, crowds applauded and Oscar nominations were announced. She attended the viewing party in a pleated, pink Vivienne Westwood gown, elegant and charming, all at the same time. VERDICT: Young and beautiful. Lust for Life? Lana’s latest EP is all about times of turbulence, but her glamour lives on and on. Proof? Her glitzy Dazed feature last year, honouring her crystal status through silk and shimmer. Dressed to divinity? 100% – Marques’ Almeida, Prada, Gucci, Balenciaga and Saint Laurent were all seen on the star. VERDICT: Magic babe, isn’t life wonderful? Call the cosmic gods – Lana’s revolution is in full swing. For this year’s Grammy Awards, she opted to channel Hedy Lamarr in a custom silk Gucci gown. Shook? Yes – we’re seeing constellations everywhere, stars in our eyes, literally. But then, when you’re the reigning Queen of Hollywood, why not top it off with a crown. VERDICT: A starry headpiece says just one thing: heaven’s in our eyes. Fit for a ball? Take a tip from Lana, who perfectly embodied this year's ‘Heavenly Bodies’ theme at the Met Ball. Renaissance reigned as she stood poised like a painting, with a casual set of daggers atop her heart. With Alessandro Michele on one arm and Jared Leto on the other, there’s only one thing missing: a throne. She’s probably resting on it as we speak. For now, we’ll have to impatiently wait for her next public appearance (and hope that it includes a baby dragon). VERDICT: The Hollywood heroine – beauty queen style. As our favourite sad-girl-bad-girl, Lana’s tailored romanticism looks set to rule for the foreseeable future – she’s well and truly here to stay. We'll race you to the the champagne – birthday celebrations are calling.

"Last Halloween, I went as the terrifying ghoul of global capitalism exploiting the labour of poor women to cheaply sell us empowerment. In other words, I wore a made in Bangladesh t-shirt printed with the slogan EMPOWER WOMEN that cost me £2 from a high street retailer, some symbolic chain earrings, and a blazer (to represent the interests of big business, obv). In a few short years, ‘empowerment’ has lost its power. Today, literally anything is ‘empowering’. A few recent examples from my inbox: a campaign for Magnum ice cream featuring Bella Hadid. Some swimming costumes. Protein powder. A luxury activewear brand. Jessie J’s new single. Low-cost internet brands like Boohoo and Missguided have been found to be selling clothes made in UK sweatshops where people are illegally paid £3.50 an hour, yet have marketing strategies that are all about empowerment – and happily flog t-shirts with phrases like ‘girl power’. It’s a future I would never have believed back in 2012, when I was sat at the table of my university’s feminist society at our Freshers’ Fair, trying unsuccessfully to lure incoming students to join our ranks. I’m sure that ‘empowerment’ was a word I used to try and convince people that feminism wasn’t just a club where we hung out and talked about how much we hated men. The responses I got, as I sat in my patched-up, riot grrrl-inspired denim jacket, were mostly bemusement, trolling, and brief, uncomfortable eye contact with people before they shuffled quickly past. In many ways, I’m thrilled about how things have changed for women since then – that calling yourself a feminist no longer carries such a bad rep. That a movement of women (and some men) would rise up against sexual harassment and assault, toppling powerful predators from their positions of power. That intersectionality is a word that many people understand – even if they’ve never heard of Kimberlé Crenshaw. But today, I am exhausted by ‘empowerment’. I am exhausted by a culture of consumption which has entirely forgotten that there’s more to feminism than buying shit to feel good about yourself. Pieces on both Nylon and i-D today praise an ‘empowering’ acne coverage tutorial video created by Fenty Beauty, with the male author of the latter going on to note that “By the end of the seven-minute video (model) Ysabelle looks fresh, dewy, and noticeably more confident”, and that covering acne with concealer “has nothing to do with the male gaze”. Disclaimer: I have nothing against make-up and can personally pay testament to the mood-boosting power of a red lip – but come the fuck on. Covering acne with concealer is not an empowering act that rejects the male gaze. It’s what beauty standards have told women they have to do for decades. Empowerment is no longer about consciousness raising, or activism, or using your position to lift up and advocate for others. Empowerment today is a bodycon jersey dress made by people paid below minimum wage. Empowerment today is a video of Bella Hadid seductively eating a Magnum. Empowerment today is something you gain through what you buy, what you wear to work out in, what you eat. That’s not empowerment. That’s purchasing power. That we can be a better, more liberated version of ourselves if we just buy this thing we don’t need that was probably made by women who are not empowered themselves is not feminism. It’s a con. “That we can be a better, more liberated version of ourselves if we just buy this thing we don’t need that was probably made by women who are not empowered themselves is not feminism. It’s a con” And it’s a particularly problematic one, at a time when there is so much to fight for. A self-proclaimed pussy-grabber is in the White House. A man accused of manipulating vulnerable women into joining his sex cult is still making music. Funding is being slashed to women’s shelters and rape crisis centres. A movie which grotesquely depicts male violence against women is debuting at the most prestigious festival in the world – which has only had 82 female directors show films compared to 1,645 men. This week, Ireland is set to vote to repeal its medieval, draconian anti-abortion laws. And that’s only in the West. I’m sure the marketing machine will soon move on to the next hip thing – whether that’s more cringe-inducing attempts at tapping into generation #woke (if you feel like clawing your own skin off, check out this Diet Coke advert) – or trying to exploit the kool niche of queerness. Don’t get me wrong: the personal is political, and self-empowerment is a real and important thing. But when we’re sold the idea of power as a purely individual force rooted in buying stuff rather than a collective one with the potential to drive forward change, all that results is a kind of tokenistic personal brand politics that doesn’t go much further than the square crops of our IG feeds. This year, we’ve seen what can happen when we come together and fight for each other. A group of models writing a charter to advocate for their rights. Irish women fighting for autonomy over their own bodies. Black actresses speaking out against racism. That’s what empowerment looks like. Not a £2 slogan t-shirt.

"Last month, John Galliano sent a tribe of ‘digital nomads’ down the catwalk as part of the Maison Margiela AW18 Artisanal show. Some wore VR-style headsets, while others sported clamps attached to their limbs holding iPhones and iPads, and another had a screen on the back of her coat. The collection blurred the line between man and machine, and it was clear that Galliano had the collision of fashion, tech, and our always-on lives in mind – which, at this point, feels inevitable. The latest evidence of that came just last week, Tommy Hilfiger announced the launch of its Tommy Jeans Xplore collection – a new line which sees t-shirts, hoodies, and dresses fitted with Bluetooth microchips. Each piece from the capsule offering will track wearers’ movements, awarding prizes depending on how much people wear the garment. And if you pass by a particular Tommy Jeans location? Mr. Hilfiger is watching you – and bestowing goodies including cinema passes, gift cards, and discount codes with which you can buy more Tommy Jeans items (which may or may not follow your every move). The Tommy Jeans Xplore range is just the tip of the iceberg, though. These so-called smart labels are actually something a number of companies have been developing – and implementing – for some time now. At Burberry, select items trigger fitting room mirrors to transition into screens and play catwalk footage and campaign films for the customer, while in late 2016, NY-based brand Rochambeau launched #borndigital, a campaign which meant that people who bought styles from its AW16 collection would be given exclusive access to clubs, gallery openings, and the label’s own fashion show by way of an accompanying app. Elsewhere, Avery Dennison, the international company that creates clothing labels for the likes of Nike, Underarmour, and Hugo Boss, has joined forces with tech start-up Evrything as part of a project that will see over 10 million garments and shoes imbued with ‘digital identities’ over the course of the next three years. For the customer, that means personalised digital content direct to your mobile device, as well as information on the item itself, offers and extras, suggestions as to what to buy next, and links to third-party companies they might be interested in (as if we really need any more of those). As for the companies that implement the smart labels, the tech will allow them to collect data on their customers, follow their movements, and eventually map out fully-formed profiles as to their lifestyles, their preferences, and their buying habits to better be able to fulfil their every requirement. Or maybe watch them while they sleep, while plotting how best to unite with an army of Alexas to overthrow humankind. This week also heralded the launch of a new app which will recommend clothing based on your Spotify data. Developed by San Francisco-based luxury menswear retailer Eison Triple Thread (which, if you ask us, sounds like some sort of fashion-focused Disney villain), the app invites users to take a lifestyle survey, before connecting to their Spotify accounts and working out what you’re likely to want to wear according to your musical preferences. While there is a correlation between some musicians and what their fans wear – take Kanye West’s incredible influence on his audience, and the success of the Yeezy brand, for example – when looking closer at the app, it doesn’t seem as clear cut as founder Julian Eison indicated in a recent interview with Racked. “If someone was born in the 80s, and listens to upbeat music from that time, we can gauge that his style is probably similar to Joey from Friends” – Julian Eison “A guy who was born between 1984 and 1988, likes hip-hop, and works in tech in San Francisco will probably like clothing that’s on trend, so we’ll feed him looks based on that demographic and see what he responds to,” he says. “If someone was born in the 80s, and listens to upbeat music from that time, we can gauge that his style is probably similar to Joey from Friends.” (...can we?) Eisom goes on to explain that people who listen to 60s music like The Beatles will have items like high-rise flares and corduroy styles suggested to them, and Lionel Richie listeners will be offered red ribbed sweaters and blue jeans. What Eisom is perhaps overlooking is that humans rarely fit into such neatly defined categories and, in reality, are a whole lot more complex than he’s giving them credit for. What is he going to put in front of the people who skip between Aphex Twin, Tommy Cash, Kate Bush, and Paris Hilton’s 2006 masterpiece “Stars are Blind” on the 45 minute bus journey to work alone (guilty)? There are upsides to some of this new tech. Since 2016, Nike has been fitting its running sneakers with a chip that can track movement, mileage, and alert the owner when they’re past their best, meaning their performance is never compromised. Smart labels can hold information as to who manufactured the garment, where it was made, the sustainability of the materials used, and how to recycle it, leading customers to make more conscious choices when it comes to the clothes they purchase, and offering brands the opportunity to improve and increase their transparency. Those of us who are prone to leaving items of clothing in the back of late night (or early morning) Ubers will have a better chance of tracking them down. And companies like Goat are developing an AI system that will be able to tell you if that tiny Louis Vuitton Speedy you just bought is real or not, with technology that can detect counterfeit items. For the most part, though, it seems brands are using these new advancements to monitor their customers’ habits to better sell them more stuff that they (probably) don’t need, and collecting information for their own gain – which raises the question of security, and what companies will do to ensure the security of the data they have amassed. “Imagine a hacked pair of shoes telling your health insurer that you don’t exercise and much as they demand for your given insurance policy, and at renewal your premium is doubled,” Dr. Richie Tynan, a technologist at Privacy International, told the Financial Times in an interview about the future of smart labelling. According to Tynan, there are no laws currently in place to regulate this process. “Imagine a hacked pair of shoes telling your health insurer that you don’t exercise and much as they demand for your given insurance policy, and at renewal your premium is doubled” – Dr. Richie Tynan A recent report by the New York Times also detailed how domestic violence cases are increasingly involving the use of smart tech, too. Abusive partners or ex-partners have been utilising home systems to intimidate (predominantly) women by suddenly blasting out music at high volumes, turning lights and appliances on and off, ringing doorbells in the middle of the night, and even changing security codes for front doors. With clothing fitted with trackers that show the wearer’s movements, the worrying reality is the information could end up in the wrong hands: those of abusers, or perhaps even stalkers. While the ability to see the production journey of a product via smart-labelling could set a revolutionary new standard for transparency in the industry, it’s hard not to feel that all of this has the potential to get more than a bit dystopian. Who knows – in a few years time, it might not just be our laptop cameras we’ll be sticking blobs of Blu-Tack over, or our phone’s microphone we muffle when we’re having private conversations. We’ll also likely be frantically searching for (tiny) chips and snipping them out of our latest purchases in a bid to maintain a fragment of our ever-diminishing digital privacy. Thanks, but no thanks – log us out.

"It seems like the party’s never over for Alexander Wang’s #WANGSQUAD. The designer has just added Ninja – one half of South African rap-rave group Die Antwoord – to his star-studded SS17 line-up that already includes British model Adwoa Aboah, Atlanta rapper Lil Yachty and three of his long-time muses, Anna Ewers, Binx Walton and Lexi Boling. Shot once more by photographic dream team, Inez & Vinoodh, this campaign sees the rapper in mock analogue photos (complete with old school time stamps) showing off his tatts in a relaxed baby blue two-piece set from Wang’s SS17 collection. Clearly comfortable, the outfit proves perfect for lounging with Adwoa, surrounded by the carnage from the night before. As for the collection itself, debuted at New York Fashion Week in September, Wang described it as “50 Shades of Grey meets Lords of Dogtown”. In addition to this ready-to-wear collection, however, the designer used the event to showcase a surprise collaboration with adidas Originals which was released the next day via pop-up trucks in NY. See more of the campaign images in the gallery above.

"Remember those iconic blue striped trainers Steve Zissou wore in The Life Aquatic? Well, adidas has actually made some. The bad news? Production was limited edition to only 100 pairs, so if you’re a die-hard Wes Anderson fan, you might have to go to great lengths (aka eBay) to get your hands on them. Worn by Bill Murray’s character – Steve Zissou – in the 2004 cult classic, the shoes were originally released back in 1959 to celebrate the Olympics in Rome, but are most known for their appearance in the film. The dark blue, light blue, dark blue stripes immediately identify them, as do the bright yellow shoelaces and the custom addition of the gold foil “Zissou” branding. The release wasn’t publically announced but the shoes were dropped at the We Love Green music festival in Paris earlier this month, where Seu Jorge – you’ll know him for his cameo in the film – was performing. Sadly the sneakers aren’t set for the mass market, but you can still get a handpainted pair from Anderson’s website. And we’re sure there will be a thriving re-sell market. Let’s hope it won’t be long before there’s a wider release. Who knows – we may even get the replicated blue jumpsuit as well.

"It’s been five months since Karl Lagerfeld passed away, yet his memory is still very much alive. After a memorial took place in Paris last month to honour the legacy of the iconic creative director, it seems that a group of his closest (and famous) friends have come together to commemorate what Lagerfeld loved the most (minus his cat Choupette): a white shirt. ‘A Tribute to Karl: The White Shirt Project’ sees Cara Delevingne, Diane Kruger, Kate Moss, Amber Valletta, Tommy Hilfiger, Alessandro Michele, Takashi Murakami, Carine Roitfeld and more design their own interpretations of Lagerfeld’s trademark white shirt with a high collar. The project will be overseen by Roitfeld, who is a style advisor at Lagerfeld’s eponymous fashion house, with all proceeds going to French charity Sauver la Vie, which funds medical research at Paris Descartes University. The designs will then be exhibited during Paris Fashion Week in September at the brand’s headquarters on Rue Saint-Guillaume. With seven designs in total, each shirt will be replicated 77 times and sold for €777 each. The number is reportedly a reference to the late designer’s favourite number, his favourite arrondissement of Paris and the address of his bookshop on the Rue de Lille. “The participants in this tribute are all people who Karl knew, who he felt connected to, or who inspired him,” says Pier Paolo Righi, chief executive officer of the Karl Lagerfeld fashion house, who described the white shirt as “a very unique and intimate way of relating back to Karl”. “After Karl’s passing, so many people wanted to share their admiration for Karl and express their emotions. I can’t imagine a better way for us to celebrate his passion for creativity,” he concludes.

"Fashion month is officially in full swing, and, just one week in, we've already seen Lil’ Kim shutting down the VFiles runway in head-to-toe Gen-Z yellow, Christina Aguilera and Sasha Velour take to the stage at Opening Ceremony (with Xtina also snatching the Queen of NYFW crown), and a group of yelling children soundtrack Eckhaus Latta's latest NYFW show. And that's before we've even started on Vaquera's after-school session and Raf Simons' JAWS-inspired Calvin Klein collection. The chaos has just started, though – with NY coming to its conclusion tonight, and London, Milan, and Paris next in line. With hectic schedules and doubtless fashion week drama on the horizon (s/o Cardi and Nicki), it goes without saying that, at some point, you're going to need a break from it. With that in mind, we've put together a list of five IG accounts and Photoshop masters that will see you through the highs and lows of the next three weeks. You're welcome... @gryffindior is the bizarre account that brings Dior’s latest collections straight to Hogwarts. Although other major brands also make a ‘guest appearance’ on the world’s favourite wizards, the French house takes over most posts. From Hagrid in Dior SS17 ‘We should all be feminist’ slogan tee, to Hermione, Harry and Ron suited and booted in Kim Jones’ colourful SS19 offering, this grid will have you thinking: should Hogwarts upgrade its uniforms, or should Dior feature the whole Harry Potter cast in its next show? @gryffindior @crispino21's account is devoted to photoshopping Anna Wintour into all sorts of hilarious situations – in a street booth offering spiritual help, for example, or taking a bathroom-selfie in her fav Christmas jumper. Her Majesty the Queen, who became Wintour’s fellow runway attendee after making a surprise appearance at Richard’s Quinn's AW18 show, is also a victim of Photoshop manipulation. @crispino21 @fashion_ouhlala is the Instagram feed where high fashion and movie characters become one. The pop culture connoisseur Photoshops cult film icons into contemporary looks that the fictional characters would actually wear, and perhaps be a perfect fit for. Our favourites include Nichelle Nichols as Star Trek’s Uhura in Mugler AW17 and Shelly Duval as Wendy Torrance in The Shining wearing Margaret Howell AW18. @fashion_ouhlala Serving the good, the bad and the ugly of catering on set, @condenastycatering will definitely make you doubt all the glam of fashion shoots. Documenting crisp-based breakfasts or late-night shoots that end with multiple boxes of Krispy Kremes, the fashion insider behind the account shows us what the real fashion diet looks like – complete with ideal snack tables as well as the worst-looking improvised lunches. @condenastycatering Head over to @mystendhalsyndrome to see all the latest fashion gems on – yes, you’ve read it right – Renaissance paintings. The grid, that gained popularity through Antonio Patruno Randolfi’s best anachronistic styling attempts, features different high-end and streetwear brands on the most iconic personalities of the 1400s onwards. The account’s Pride post – Portrait of a Gentleman by François Henri Mulard (1805) in a Burberry rainbow jacket and Gentle Monster sunglasses – is without a doubt one of our favourites. @mystendhalsyndrome

"This season fashion flipped the front row phone circus on its head. In London Fashion Week's viral moment, Cara Delevingne walked the Giles catwalk, filming a video selfie – suddenly the fashion show was less about the clothes and more about the phone in her hand. But this wasn’t the first time phone culture intruded on the catwalk. On the first day of LFW, Fyodor Golan showcased their digital technicolour dream skirt – an interactive “smart” skirt made of 80 Nokia Lumia 1520 smartphones. At once – as would happen three days later at Giles – the bubble of the fantasy, archaic fashion presentation popped, as we came to realise the extent of the fashion spectacle, and the role of the phone within it. At Fyodor Golan, audiences filmed a phone, through their phone, as a phone played images back at them. At Giles, we filmed a phone filming us. In the circus of screens, interfaces and obsessive instant documentation, you come to wonder at what point are we actually looking at the clothes? At Fyodor Golan the audience – and the focus of their camera phones – was on the skirt’s glistening rhythm of colour, created by static images and live feeds interacting with movement and the environment. A purpose-built app utilising global positioning ensured that the movement of the images on the screen happened in line with the model’s – in this case appropriately worn by technicolour-haired model Chloe Norgaard. The skirt is clearly a showpiece in that each phone in itself costs £850, is packed with a powerful camera, ultra-vivid screen and cutting edge functionality – yet its role in the runway is to shimmer, animate and shift on command. “A circus of screens, interfaces and obsessive instant documentation” Fyodor and Golan were captivated by the vivid digital display of Nokia's new phone and its ability to perform changing colours and shimmer effects simulating realistic characteristics of fabric. Being quite a large, rectangular phone, the silhouette options for the skirt was always going to be limited, however where the Nokia 1520 is strong with the force is its photographic capabilities. Armed with a 41 megapixel camera, this is a dream work tool for hundreds of front row editors, buyers and photographers at fashion week, for whom smartphones are playing an increasingly integral role in documenting, reporting and publishing looks online before they even hit the end of the runway. The images displayed on the skirt were taken during Fyodor and Golan’s travels to Burma, photographs collaged together to create a touch screen mosaic of pattern using an app developed by digital agency Kin. We asked the design duo to discuss the future – whether technology and the way we perceive the world through digital screens is affecting the way we wear colour and see fashion. With phones now not only recording the runway, but starring on it too, where can the digital spectacle move next? Dazed Digital: Has modern display technology changed your perception of colour? As fashion designers? Fyodor Golan: We are so drilled in judging the world through our little screens. For better or worse, our eyes’ perception has changed. For us, the most current way to work with textures is to use materials that we all know and transform them through feel and shine and always think of our pieces in 360 degrees. This season we were focused on iridescence using leathers, sequins and Swarovski crystals. Vibrance adds another layer to the garment, so that it’s not enough to just walk around in a green jacket, you'll have to wear a green iridescent jacket that changes colours to blue, then shines in pink! DD: You have described your approach to your AW14 collection as 'modernising the wildness of hues with technology'. How did technology contribute to the colour and textures in this collection? Fyodor Golan: Technology brings new elements to surface design. It is amazing what you can do with innovative coatings – for example, this season it helped us to transform wool to look like metallic pink leather, we were able to work with nylon coated cottons and print holograms for FG sweatshirts. We partnered with Swarovski to create a crystal embedded 3D-printed piece and partnered with Nokia on the 'phone skirt', which imitates the shine of fabrics with movement of colours over the phone screens as the model walks. DD: Tell me about the experience of 3D printing your first FG piece. Is the 3D printing process for a wearable piece as complex as one imagines? Fyodor Golan: OMFG. It was a long process and not an easy one! First of all, we were shocked to discover how a 3D garment design can be achieved on these new programs designers use. You can drape materials on a form on the computer and control it all at once with a 360-degree perspective. When we were designing we experienced many happy accidents, especially because it was our first time and there was so much to discover. Wearable materials are starting to become available to 3D printed fashion but the majority are still on the stiff side, so we’re still stuck in the realm of creating showpieces. However, it’s only a matter of time until we’ll be able to print a complete garment that can defy gravity and is soft enough to be worn. DD: Are you personally avid technology users? Do you guys plan on continuing to experiment with technology for fashion’s sake? Fyodor Golan: Funny thing is that we are not avid techies, but we are fascinated by it so we definitely will. It’s the future and we can't wait until we can design more wearable things using new technology. Our direction is to find ways to bring this to our everyday reality, but in a fabulous way! DD: What would be some great characteristics of a futuristic fashion garment? Fyodor Golan: Before we even go into the whole dress that can 'walk and talk', we'd love to the develop innovative materials that can change with the wearer, such as one that thickens when you want it to, and or one that becomes lighter on command. Something that can change colour or feel different against the body. One more – we have a dream to create a 3D embellishment that can move.

"To celebrate its AW18 collection, Dazed has teamed up with Gucci to spotlight three young British artists using their art to spark conversations around identity, freedom and self-expression. While he may be the younger brother of former Dazed 100er, designer and artist Ryan Hawaii, 19-year-old model, artist, and skater Connor Kawaii is becoming well known in his own right. After a skateboarding-related injury left Kawaii with a broken wrist and doctors orders to rest up for a month, he spent his time longing to get back on a deck. It was during this time he decided to turn his attention to a new venture. Noticing a gap in the market for inventive skate decks, Kawaii experimented with collaging and began transferring these onto decks. “I started experimenting with collaging which I’d never tried before and I thought why not combine the two? Skateboarding and collaging.” The decks, which are carefully layered with text and imagery, are sourced from various books and magazines – such as a coffee table book of golden-era Playboy editorials, of which the skater-cum-artist cuts his way through the glossy pages with the intention to build his next deck. Modelling has been a successful side-hustle for Kawaii, and while many see him as an ‘alternative’ model, he thinks a little differently. Signed to Anti-Agency, the modelling agency celebrating the alternative, Kawaii spoke on the idea of him being labelled this way, mentioning “now people with dreads aren’t necessarily considered ‘alternative’ models, I’d say they’re becoming the norm now. About five or so years ago we would be the weird-looking alternative models.”, but while he believes there has been a shift, Kawaii acknowledges that there’s still some way to go, adding “they need to carry on in the direction they’re going in and continue pushing the boundaries by doing what they think is right and not what they think is cool.” Here, we speak to Kawaii about his biggest influences, skateboarding, and starting his own company. Who is the biggest influence for your work? Connor Kawaii: My brother. And Jason Dill from Fucking Awesome. What is your main form of self-expression? Connor Kawaii: Skateboarding – I started about three years ago. There isn’t a crazy story of how I started or anything, I just did. But also, I’ve never been the arty one, Ryan’s always been the arty one. I (was) the sporty kid and he’s the deep-thinker with the creative mind, so this is all quite new to me. I’m still perfecting my craft and the methods I use to make these skateboards. I’m proud of what I’ve done so far and I want to continue doing it and pushing the boundaries. “I started experimenting with collaging which I’d never tried before and I thought why not combine the two? Skateboarding and collaging” – Connor Kawaii What was the driving force for starting your own company, Radius Skateboards? Connor Kawaii: Breaking my wrist and being away from skateboarding for about a month. I was watching skate videos and that, but it wasn’t enough – I wanted to still do something. So I started experimenting with collaging which I’d never tried before and I thought why not combine the two? Skateboarding and collaging. I was seeing a lot of people doing this just from being out with skaters, but no one was tapping into the business side of it. I see some guys from America like @watchyoudie and @yungspliff, they do the whole art stuff too, but the way I do it is more intricate. What mediums do you use? Connor Kawaii: I collect books that I think are interesting, cut them up and start collecting the images in a wallet. I start fishing through it and think about what pieces would look good together, lay them out on a board and stick them down. How have you found breaking into the creative industry? Connor Kawaii: It’s been quite hard, to be honest. It’s real hard building up a following. I model part-time and it’s way easier to gain a following that way because people want to see a pretty face so they’re more likely to follow you. But, if it’s a photo of a skateboard it’s quite hard for everyday people to relate. It’s about building up that support and fanbase, then eventually dropping stuff and that’s what I’m working at. What is the best thing about living in London as a creative? Connor Kawaii: Everything’s at your doorstep – there’s so much stuff to do. So many skate parks, as well. London is littered with it, there’s still so many I haven’t been to and I’ve been to a lot – I like seeing different parks and the different architecture they all have. There’s always stuff happening in London, good club nights and events – there’s always something to do. Gucci's AW18 collection is available now, you can shop Connor's look and shoes.

"Carmen Wu is the menswear designer who started her career in fashion because she was in love. Not with a particular designer that filled her with inspiration, or a collection that struck a chord somewhere inside of her, but with her ex-boyfriend, who she followed to London when he moved to the city. “When I got here, I started applying to university and ended up taking a place at London College of Fashion, before moving on to do a Masters at Westminster,” she explains. Wu graduated last week, and the rest, as they say, is history. “And I have a new boyfriend now,” she laughs. It’s in these boyfriends – both past and present – that the young designer finds inspiration. “I’m fascinated by their whole lifestyle,” she says. “I get inspired by what they watch on Netflix, what they eat, what they do, and, most importantly, what they wear.” This translates into sportswear-inspired styles including abstract printed hoodies, oversized shirts thrown over worn-out tees, panelled denim jeans, and dad caps emblazoned with ‘Loser’. On what her exes make of this, Wu explains that her collection is not to be taken at face value. “I want to bring humour into fashion,” she says. “I want my clothing to have a light-hearted element and I don’t want people to take it too seriously. And I want the people that wear it to be able to joke about themselves whilst still feeling totally confident. It’s a celebration of mundane boys, as opposed to something negative.” Despite a strong collection, Wu was not one of the students selected to show as part of Westminster’s graduate presentation – and so decided to take matters into her own hands. “When I found out I hadn’t been chosen, the first thing that came into my mind was that I didn’t agree with their decision,” she recalls. “I felt like I had to do something to fight back and stand up for my collection. And so I decided to do my own thing.” Teaming up with stylist Danny Reed – who co-cast the cover of the summer issue of Dazed – Wu threw a guerilla show outside the institute’s official one, where models wearing the collection hung around and chatted. “Danny and I met when he was a visiting tutor on our course,” she says. “We hit it off because we both liked each other’s aesthetic, and we’re both interested in the mundane, the average, or the wrong. Great minds think alike.” Featuring a line-up of unconventional models, Reed felt it was important to establish ‘the Carmen Wu boy’ from her very first collection. “It was important to us to street-cast the models,” he explains. “The guys modelling are a mix of friends, boys from Instagram, and Carmen’s boyfriend Joey, who is referenced a lot throughout the collection.” When it came to Wu’s vision of ‘her boy’, there was only one thing to consider: “is he cute enough to be my boyfriend?” she laughs. Sorry, Joey.

"To say that Philipp Plein loves a spectacle is quite the understatement – and Philipp Plein has never made an understatement in his life. Last night, the German designer put on a show that included rappers, snowmobiles, a Transformer, supermodels, and a literal spaceship. Here’s what went down. Philipp Plein AW18 was centered around the idea of winter in outer space. The show was held in a massive warehouse in the Brooklyn Navy Yard, and the whole place was covered in fluffy fake snow which eventually began to fall down in great quantities, sticking to everyone’s hair. The back wall featured a massive silver mountain below a sign spelling out “PHILIPP PLEIN” in lights and all caps. The entire evening was in ALL CAPS too. The night kicked off with a pair of snowmobilers bursting through the silver peak. And then came the rappers: Migos and Rich the Kidd performed, as did 6ix9ine, aka Tekashi 69. 6ix9ine’s single “Gummo” is currently at No. 24 on the Billboard Charts, but it peaked at No. 12. We aren’t fans, though. The rapper is currently awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty to the charge of “the use of a child in a sexual performance”, for making a video featuring a 13-year-old girl performing sexual acts. Here’s some recommended reading from the New York Times on the subject. Following the musicians, an enormous Transformer (presumably a human in a transformer suit, but still) covered in Plein logos appeared. It walked along the front row, asking attendees if they were “wearing Philipp Plein.” The Transformer then accompanied show-opener Irina Shayk for a lap around the venue – and it began to sing Frank Sinatra’s “Fly Me to the Moon.” I repeat: a giant robot sang a classic Swoonatra jam whilst walking with a supermodel in a fashion show. This being a Philipp Plein show, Shayk did not kick things off with something so simple as merely walking. No. Never. Instead, the model was lowered to the ground in the belly of a logo-bearing spaceship, off of which she glided to join her robot prince. A spaceship. A spaceship! After each model – including the likes of Halima Aden, Avie Acosta, Alton Mason, Snoop’s son Calvin Broadus, and an unbelievable double-amputee runner – completed their endless laps around the cavernous warehouse, they posed beneath the ship, which was shooting red lasers everywhere. For the finale, they all danced to “Bad and Boujee.” As you do. Just in time for the winter Olympics, Plein’s clothing showed a take on winter athletic wear; some models appeared with skis or snowboards, including one who was wearing a crystal bandeau top. Several models sported sleek catsuits. Backpacks were worn on fronts, and there were knee-high furry boots galore. There was of course a mens’ leather jacket emblazoned with dollar signs. Plein’s gotta give the people what they want. Or what he wants.

"Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana have been found innocent of tax evasion, with Italy's highest court overturning the pair's previous convictions on Friday. Italian prosecutors accused the Dolce & Gabbana designers of funnelling funds to a Luxembourg company in order to avoid paying taxes totalling €200 million. The pair had been under investigation for tax fraud since 2008 and were sentenced last year to 20-month suspended jail sentences. However, Italy's supreme court has annulled the convictions and cited the prosecution's case as ""unfounded"". Dolce & Gabbana released a simple statement on Friday night, saying: ""We have always been honest and we are extremely proud of this recognition by the Italian court of justice."" Prosecutors had argued that setting up the Luxembourg-based company Gado, a moniker comprised of their two surnames, was a deliberate attempt to defraud the state. The legendary designers have always maintained their innocence and had appealed against the ruling. The decision from Italy's top court is absolute, meaning that the case is now closed forever – or, as Dominco and Stefano put it: ""Viva l'Italia.""

"You can now walk around with a stuffed cat hanging off your arm that boasts a combined 142,000 followers across social media. A luxury, stuffed version of Choupette – the “sacred Birman with immaculate fur” owned by Karl Lagerfeld – can become your next cuddle buddy. The “Garbo of cats” has been immortalized in a new collaboration with German plush toy company, Steiff. Choupette doesn’t come cheap – she retails for £420 at STYLEBOP. She will be sold in a limited edition of 2,000. Choupette is accompanied by a signed certificate (because she has her own autograph), along with a brief explainer of whom, exactly, you’ve just adopted. “Hi, I’m Choupette,” the certificate reads. “Without modesty, I am the most famous cat in the world. I must admit I was born under a lucky star – at a very young age, I met the man of my dreams: Karl Lagerfeld! It really was immediate and mutual ‘love at first sight!’” Lagerfeld lapped up the idea to create a plush version of his beloved companion. “Choupette is such a famous and beautiful cat that when this request came to me, I was not even surprised,” he said in a statement. “Steiff is the perfect choice for this kind of collaboration. It’s the only company that has the required expertise to highlight the extreme and absolute refinement of this young princess.” Choupette is available from May 23.

"Copying has been a big conversation in fashion for the past couple of years, and for Vetements designer Demna Gvasalia, comparisons between his work and that of Martin Margiela have been made ever since his buzzy Parisian label first appeared on the fashion circuit. Returning to the runway this season, he addressed them head-on, in a collection that explored what he called the “elephant in the room”. The words themselves even appeared on a t-shirt, as drawn by children at a kindergarten near to the Vetements studio in Switzerland, and inspired by the time Margiela invited children to design his show invites. “I went back to my roots as a designer, I went back to Margiela,” Gvasalia said post-show, referring to the period he spent working at the Maison between 2009 and 2012. “I wanted to show what Margiela means for me, and for Vetements. It’s an approach, it’s not a person. It’s a way of loving clothes, breaking the rules with those clothes. And that’s what we did.” How did that translate into the collection? Well, there was lots of rule breaking. Jackets were worn inside out, trousers were too long, socks were paired with pool slides, clothes were creased, and there were – I kid you not – tribal tattoo style prints. The most obvious Margiela-ism was the cloven-toed boots, a reference to what is arguably the Belgian designer’s most iconic creation – the Tabi. Demna’s came in sparkly knee high lurex versions, and one pair had a stack of coins forming the heel. “I wanted to show what Margiela means for me, and for Vetements. It’s an approach, it’s not a person. It’s a way of loving clothes, breaking the rules with those clothes. And that’s what we did” – Demna Gvasalia In light of the explicit references, we had to ask: what does Gvasalia make of Instagram accounts which do side-by-side, who’s-copying-who callouts like the now-infamous @diet_prada? “It creates transparency and I think that’s a great thing,” he said. “Transparency I feel is something that will help fashion to evolve, in general. I think it’s great, I don’t think it’s a negative. I think it’s a very positive thing. It just makes us work harder! But that’s a good thing. It’s a healthy thing.” As for the idea that designers shouldn’t be allowed to allow their eyes to wander to what’s already out there? “Everything is an appropriation,” Gvasalia said – pointing out that even Margiela’s Tabi was inspired by a traditional Japanese style. “We live in a world that is full of references, and references exist to feed us, but not to feed us in order to copy – they feed us in order to create something new from it. And that’s I think what I put as the challenge for myself.”

"After last season’s ‘no after-party’ show, Alexander Wang wanted to make SS18 all about the party. Dubbed #WangFest, the designer presented the collection not once but three times – transporting the models in a party bus around the city. The last of the three events took place in a dead-end road in Bushwick, that became the venue for the afterparty as soon as the show finished. As the guests recover from their Wangovers (sorry) here’s everything you need to know about the collection. Starting at Wang HQ, the travelling show made two stops before it reached the fashion crowd in Brooklyn. Open to the public, the gang made their way from location to location, stopping off to shut down the streets and sashay on the makeshift runways. As for the bus itself, it was packed with the models and neon lights with a chic all-black exterior emblazoned with the words #WANGFEST. Of course this isn’t the first time Wang has partied on a bus, he loves them so much he also shot his SS15 campaign on one. Sticking true to the party vibe, the models wore outfits that looked like lacy slip tops and cashmere sweaters spliced together as if they had all run out of their 9-5 office job on a Friday and pulled on whatever they could find before heading to a cool party downtown. Others wore tailored jackets presented casually wrapped around their waists. If you’re one of those people who can’t decide between denim shorts or leather trousers when you’re off on a night out, you don’t need to worry – Wang made a case for wearing both layered on top of one another. After debuting on the runway for SS17 and then being sold out of the back of a truck last season, the New York label teamed up on a collaboration with adidas Originals once again. This season, the collection came in the form of hybrid leather/denim trousers with the signature triple stripe and the iconic trefoil logo reimagined upside-down. The standout piece though was the zip-up jacket with extra sleeves wrapped around the waist to cinch you in. Or alternatively to give you a permanent hug. No doubt wanting to make up for the lack of an after-party last season, Wang came back with a bang. Turning the outdoor venue straight into a post-show celebration, there was a bouncy castle – that we would have paid to see show attendee Kim Kardashian on – and giant ice sculptures all emblazoned with WANGFEST. Attendees enjoyed performances from rapper Cardi B, dressed in a full Wang look. Ashanti and JaRule also joined the performance list and in case you were wondering, yes they did perform their 2001 anthem “Always on Time” – even if the show wasn’t. In a first resident party boy Wang teamed up with hat designer Stephen Jones to create the chicest party hats ever. Together, the pair created black feather tiaras with diamante slogans like “PARTY ANIMAL” and “WANGOVER” and a cigarette smoke-effect version that ironically read “No Smoking”. Next season’s must have accessory?

"Prolific writer and unflappable legend Joan Didion has been hand-picked as the new face of Céline for SS15, alongside French ballet dancer and choreographer Marie-Agnès Gillot and British model Freya Lawrence. The definition of graceful ageing, Didion is lensed by Juergen Teller sporting a pair of sunglasses from the collection. Taking her infallible sophistication full circle, a portrait of a nonchalant Didion by Julian Wasser for Life magazine also served as inspiration for a shot in the brand’s resort campaign: model Daria Werbowy hanging out of a Corvette Stingray, shot by Tyrone Lebon (below). The queen of effortless cool is the perfect choice for a brand like Céline, and she's bringing that cool to a new documentary about her life – We Tell Ourselves Stories in Order to Live – directed by her nephew Griffin Dunne. As a writer for Vogue in the early 60s, she transformed fashion writing and infused her signature insight into a fruitful career as an author. Check out our Céline SS15 show report here.

"For the first time in Sarah Burton’s six-year tenure as creative director of Alexander McQueen, the brand has released a fragrance – until now. Today marks the launch of the scent, named McQueen Parfum, and its accompanying campaign. Shot by legendary photographer Paolo Roversi, the campaign stars Dutch model Maartje Verhoef, who has walked in a grand total of five McQueen shows, including the most recent at London Fashion Week last month. Roversi captures Verhoef, who poses in the woods of the 17th-century Chateau de Courances near Fontainebleau wearing a custom-made gown embellished with black floral appliqués, Roversi’s images succeed in capturing the dark romance that the brand’s creative director Sarah Burton inherited from her friend and mentor, Lee Alexander McQueen himself. Speaking on the fragrance itself, Burton says, “I wanted this fragrance to come from night flowers, the kind that exudes an eternal freshness once the day is gone... Here at McQueen, we are all about discoveries and the eternal blossom; originality in an atmosphere of tradition, craft, and daring.” McQueen Parfum comes in the wake of the house’s AW16 womenswear show – which was staged in London, as opposed to Paris, for the first time in 15 years. The venue (the Royal Horticultural Halls in Westminster) had personal resonance for Burton – the first McQueen show she worked on was staged there too. See exclusive behind the scenes images from the campaign shoot: Watch the ‘making of’ Shona Heath’s window display for the fragrance below: McQueen Parfum is available exclusively at Harrods, London on 1st March, and Alexander McQueen boutiques in London, Paris, and Monaco

"Move over, Naomi, Claudia and Cindy. In the battle of the supermodels, there can only be one winner – and that's Rihanna. In an interview with the Independent, Balmain's Olivier Rousteing says that the Bajan singer has replaced the iconic 80s and 90s models in terms of fashion power. ""When you look at an old Versace show, you loved the dress, but you loved Claudia Schiffer, you loved Cindy Crawford. Supermodels! With Rihanna you get that too,"" he explains. ""Today people are looking at Rihanna like they were looking at Naomi Campbell or Claudia... nobody wants to be a model, everybody wants to be a singer. That's the new dream. I think having Rihanna in the campaign is like having Cindy Crawford or Christy Turlington, but for my generation."" Rihanna has long served as Rousteing's muse and celebrity BFF, but she was also picked by the 28-year-old designer to be the face for his SS14 campaign, which was styled by her stylist Mel Ottenberg and shot by Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin. ""It was an amazing statement for the house, for fashion,"" Rousteing says. ""It was really important that she was doing the campaign because she's my muse, she's my icon, and she's my friend."" In a release for the campaign, Rousteing described her as an ""icon"". ""She owned the clothes,"" he says. ""That's exactly what I want. I love seeing a woman, the feeling of a model, a top model."" Rousteing isn't the only one who rates Rihanna's star power: Tom Ford has also stated that getting your clothes featured on Rihanna's Instagram is more powerful than a show review from a fashion critic. What do you think – is Rihanna the new supermodel for our generation?

"Retail giant Zara have created an “ungendered” section on their website – featuring unisex basics including t-shirts, tracksuits and jeans modelled by both a male and female model and designed to be worn by any gender. The news was first reported by Bustle, who commented that the decision was evidence of “how progressive the beloved store is”, and that it “helps break down the idea that there are only two genders”. Non-binary gender identity is a topic that has been brought to the fore over the last year, with pop-cultural talking points including Jaden Smith’s decision to wear skirts (including in a Louis Vuitton womenswear campaign) and Miley Cyrus’s announcement that she self-defines as gender fluid. Thanks to the likes of Caitlyn Jenner, Hari Nef and Dazed cover star Jazz Jennings, transgender issues and rights are also in the spotlight. Of course, the fashion industry has a long history of flirting with the rules of gender – notable examples include Yves Saint Laurent’s Le Smoking suits for women, or the time Jean Paul Gaultier outraged editors in the 80s by sending men in kilts down his runway. More recently, Alessandro Michele has been hailed for his gender-fluid vision for Gucci – where boys are seen donning pussybow blouses and jewelled rings. However, many gender non-conforming individuals struggle with “an industry ill-equipped to deal with trans and nonbinary people”, as Dazed writer Sean Faye put it in a piece on shopping while trans. So – will Zara’s new move open up a more progressive way of seeing the shop floor? Or is it simply an on trend rebranding of unisex clothing – which brands like American Apparel have been doing for decades?

"If Martin Margiela is known for his whites, and Valentino for red, then Simon Porte Jacquemus is without doubt represented by blue and yellow. The French designer’s Instagram is awash with shades of sunshine, sky, and sea, as he splits his time between his atelier in Paris and his hometown in Provence, where he hangs out by the pool or at the beach with his nephews and beloved grand-mère, rides barefoot around town on his scooter, and dances to loud pop music at provincial nightclubs with lifelong friends including Jeanne Damas. Sounds completely joyous? It is. Simon’s joie de vivre is as evident in every image he posts to IG as it is in his playful, sexy, woman-celebrating collections, demonstrating a sense of uninhibited happiness and humour that fashion can sometimes lack. It also serves as a reminder to appreciate what you have – the designer is a man of simple pleasures, and seems all the more content for it. “Jacquemus is not about nightlife and clubbing and things like that,” he told us back in 2016. “It’s more about fruit and vegetables and rolling in the grass.” And while, admittedly, it does look like Simon spends a lot of time rolling in said grass in the sun-drenched South of France, appearances can be deceptive. In addition to his womenswear offering, the (twice) LVMH Prize-nominated designer has been busy putting the finishing touches to his debut menswear collection, which he presents as part of a runway show in Marseille tonight. First announced back in February at the end of his AW18 show, he’s been teasing at what he has in-store for the boys ever since: first with a shot of French rugby player Yoann Meistri wearing a pair of white pants as he revealed the collection’s name, Le Gadjo, and later with a series of sneak peeks at final preparations for this evening’s event. As we count down the hours until he reveals what he’s been working on over the course of the last few months, here we outline some of the joyous lessons to be learnt from the designer’s Instagram account. The IG posts in which Simon dances and sings with friends are but a small part of the bigger picture: head to his Instagram stories for a lot more of this. In this video posted just a few days before the upcoming Le Gadjo show, the designer takes a break from last-minute preparations (note: a v good idea in itself) to dance on a terrace overlooking the sea at dusk with one of his beaucoup La Bomba pals. And not only does he dance, he sings too. Granted, not particularly well, but we love him all the more for it. The lesson? Close your eyes and just let go. Over the years, Simon has been honing the aesthetic of his label. Sure, he’s found models who are actually from Marseille for his shows and even cast his very own cousin once, but who better to represent the Jacquemus life, than Jacquemus himself? Here, we see Simon in a white dress from his Les Santons de Provence SS17 collection, BTS at the collection’s campaign shoot. Elsewhere (scroll back up to the cover to feast your eyes again) we see the designer on a black sandy beach dressed in a beaded dress, giant sun hat, and tiny handbag from his SS18 La Bomba collection – meaning ‘the bomb’. Goes without saying, but that’s exactly how we feel about Simon. For Simon, the south of France is more than just a constant source of inspiration, it’s his home and is where his heart will always be. Splitting his time between Paris and his birthplace, the designer loves to show off all his favourite things – most of them memories from his childhood. For his book Marseille je t’aime, one image shows an aerial shot of Simon lying in his grandparents’ field surrounded by his fashions. He’s literally down-to-earth. Other than us – the biggest fans IMO – Simon has fans all over the world, desperate to wear his clothes and become the Jacquemus woman (and man, shortly). Among them are Rihanna, Dua Lipa, Miley Cyrus, Selena Gomez, and even royalty in the form of Princess Lalla Meryem of Morocco. With all of that fame and adoration, Simon still hasn’t let it go to his head. He’s never to good to pose for a picture. He’s the people’s designer, and he’ll never let us down. One of the most endearing things about Simon is his ability to laugh at himself, which he does on the regular: take his throwback posts as proof if you’re in need of some. Including pictures of him as a gap-toothed kid, his forays into child modelling (including for Pampers and French Carambars), and later as an emo-fringed, moody (although we’re guessing not that moody) teenager, in an industry in which ‘cool’ is the ultimate currency, it’s refreshing to be confronted by someone who takes it all in his stride. Though Simon’s life may seem idyllic, as he dashes between Paris and Provence and frequently gets down amongst that aforementioned grass in the sun, he has had more than his fair share of sadness. When he was 18, his mother Valérie died, prompting him to start Jacquemus (which was her maiden name). He also dedicated his AW15 collection to her, and has explained he continuously designs for the girl she once was. “My mother was very warm, and also a bit childish in the way she would wear big pantaloon trousers or granny dresses,” he told AnOther in 2016. “Without any money she could look very special and artistic. She wasn’t ‘French chic’. She was too smiley for that, with her shiny eyes and shiny persona.” Now, the designer remains close to his family, with cousin Jean and his grandmother appearing regularly on his IG, all warm smiles and shiny eyes (and sometimes in pieces from his collections). Of his disposition, Simon explains: “I’m never sad. I’m not obsessed with being the best or the biggest. I just want to stay free.” *Insert ten heart emojis here* Unlike many of us who grew up in small, provincial towns and were desperate to leave at the first opportunity, Simon has always loved his hometown, and balances his city-based job with life in the countryside. He also really loves his grandmother’s donkeys who regularly feature on his IG, and the quiet moments he spends with them, getting back to nature out in the field. Okay, fine, so he’s prolific when it comes to documenting those quiet moments in his many, many stories... but when his stories involve heartwarming shots and videos of him tenderly petting the animals, you won’t find us complaining. You might think that with his family, love of nature, and pride in his birthplace Simon doesn’t have any more space for love in his life, but you’d be wrong. Following his AW18 collection, the designer finally announced what his ‘new job’ was – a new menswear line. “I was like ‘when I fall in love is when I’m going to do the men’s because he’s going to exist’,” the designer shared backstage. “When he’s someone I can see, someone I can smell and I know what he’s eating – I know everything about him.” Although we have since learned that our handsome hero is now single, that isn’t stopping his menswear line from continuing. We love you Simon, and we hope you feel the same.

"Already a staple of the label's front row and a star of its campaigns, Kristen Stewart is set to step in front of Chanel's cameras once again for a new short. The Karl Lagerfeld-directed film, which will be shown at the Chanel Métiers d'Arts show on December 1, will see the actress take on the role of the fashion house's founder, Gabrielle “Coco” Chanel – sort of. In a confusingly meta twist, Stewart will actually be playing an actress getting ready to play the French fashion icon, in a mock-teaser of a fictional biopic. “She played it really, really mean,” Lagerfeld told wwd.com. “You only see her in tests and she’s complaining about everything. She’s mean with the director; mean with the producer.” The film was conceived entirely by the Chanel creative director, and shot at Luc Besson's studio in Paris last month. Stewart will star alongside actress Geraldine Chaplin, who has already played the French icon in one of Lagerfeld's earlier films. “They make so many movies about Chanel, why can’t I make one?” he added.

"After a too-long hiatus, Nicolas Ghesquière's return to fashion as the new designer of Louis Vuitton was greeted with wild applause. Yesterday's show was a triumph of minimalism (albeit one that featured leather, PVC and lots of perversion), ushering in a new age for the venerable house. Today, Vuitton released A Dozen Girls, a portfolio look at the new collection – as photographed by iconic lensman Juergen Teller. Shot at the brand's Paris headquarters and interspersed with images of its location by the Seine, the series is photographed in Teller's characteristically unvarnished style and features twelve looks from yesterday's collection on models like Liya Kebede, Mica Arganaraz and Julia Hafstrom. Teller initially photographed Ghesquière for System magazine, in the designer's first post-Balenciaga interview. It's an interesting choice of photographer for Vuitton, given that Teller's work had been so closely associated with Ghesquière's predecessor. The German photographer had been shooting campaigns for Marc Jacobs's own brand since 1998, until the former declined to shoot Miley Cyrus for Jacobs's label's spring/summer 2014 campaign. Instead, David Sims stepped in. We can only hope Teller's images for Vuitton might signal the start of a long, beautiful relationship between the photographer and Ghesquière.

"Last night, in New York City, the likes of Lady Gaga, Billy Porter, Ezra Miller, and even Kendall and Kylie brought it to the pink carpet, as the camp-themed 2019 Met Gala got underway. On Thursday, the exhibition itself – Camp: Notes on Fashion – opens to the public at The Met Fifth Avenue and The Met Cloisters in NYC. Bringing together four centuries of OTT fashion and art, the show uses Susan Sontag’s 1964 essay Notes on Camp to frame the ways designers have embraced camp’s tongue-in-cheek spirit in their métier. If you have plans to be in the city before the end of September, Notes on Fashion is a must-see. And if you don’t, here are five reasons that needs to change. “One should either be a work of art, or wear a work of art,” Oscar Wilde once wrote – a quote that Sontag uses at the top of her 58-point list, in recognition that at its heart, camp is about the convergence of fashion and art in affluent societies as a subversive response to the status quo. The exhibition begins in the royal courts of Louis XIV and Louis XV where the concept of se camper – or “to posture boldly” – first arose, and traces its lineage over the past four centuries. Spanning menswear and womenswear, and including sculptures, paintings and drawings, the show is full of iconic designs by fashion legends including Yves Saint Laurent, Cristobal Balenciaga, Chanel, and Gucci. Camp, like fashion, is a sensibility rooted in aestheticism, artifice, extravagance, and theatricality, all taken to dizzyingly ambitious heights. “Camp is the answer to the problem: how to be a dandy in the age of mass culture,” Sontag writes. Camp: Notes on Fashion offers a unique view of the world through the camp-y lens of style, putting a dazzling array of modern dandy-worthy ensembles from the House of Schiaparelli, Moschino, and Gianni Versace on show, alongside quotes that illustrate a sensibility that is, as Sontag also wrote, “serious about the frivolous, frivolous about the serious.” “Camp is ‘a clenched fist and a limp wrist,’” as Richard Dyer said – a testament to the fact that the LGBTQ+ community has been at the vanguard of camp long before its current definition was first detailed in the early 1900s. Camp: Notes on Fashion is a true celebration of queerness and fluidity, and demonstrates fashion’s storied history when it comes to blurring the line between gender, paying homage to the trailblazers that paved the way, as well as contemporary designers continuing in their wake: Burberry’s AW18 rainbow cape, Thom Browne’s SS18 hybrid wedding dress, and a plethora of Marc Jacobs’ more androgynous works all on show. “It’s no coincidence that camp surfaces in moments of social, political, and economic instability, ” Camp curator Andrew Bolton writes in the exhibition catalogue. “Camp, despite its mainstreaming, has never lost its power to be rebellious or to challenge the status quo, should the situation warrant.” The exhibition is a timely response to the present day, recognising the deep polarities that have torn societies apart can be re-approached through camp’s use of irony, humor, parody, pastiche, exaggeration, and panache, restoring a sense of love and joy to a deeply battered world. Seeing Heatherette’s Hello Kitty dress alongside the iconic Marjan Pejoski swan dress Björk wore to the 2001 Academy Awards, as a soundtrack of Judy Garland singing “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” plays softly throughout offers a moment of escapism from what’s going on outside the building: and sometimes that’s all you need. Whether naïve or intentional, camp is an embrace of enjoyment, appreciation, and generosity. Camp is laughing with you – never at you. “Camp taste is a kind of love, love for human nature,” Sontag writes. “It relishes, rather than judges, the little triumphs and awkward intensities of ‘character.’” Who among us cannot relate? Camp is the perfect blend of style, glamour, and vulgarity. Vulgar because it knows better than anyone else, that you are totally naked underneath these clothes, and it takes great pleasure in this fact. Camp is choosing a slip of a mannequin with a flat bum to wear an SS01 Chloé bathing suit that warns “KEEP YOUR BANANA OFF MY MELONS” in all seriousness. In an exhibition that is realised in exquisite detail, it is a subtle touch that might be quite naïve – making it all the more sweet. Camp: Notes on Fashion runs from May 9 – September 8 2019 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. Book your tickets here.

"Taken from the autumn/winter issue of Dazed. You can buy a copy of our latest issue here. For the autumn/winter issue of Dazed, we profiled a new class of London design graduates accelerating fashion — from the torn-up and time-travelling creations of James Crewe, to the twisted body cages of Sam Chester, seen on Björk in her Autumn cover shoot. How many ways are there to walk? Your speed, gait and swing say as much about you as the clothes you wear. Of course, it’s not always the truth, and any time you’d like to look bigger or stronger, you can just puff yourself up with a little more swagger. Christian Stone was struck by the near-comedy of this artifice, which is so often bound up with ideals of masculinity. “Living in Brooklyn, I’d see men walking down the street in an almost monstrous way, taking these huge steps with hunched-up shoulders,” he says. “It seemed so abnormal. I found it fascinating.” Stone was watching a lot of The Walking Dead at the time, and became obsessed with how the gym-selfie phenomenon fetishises the male body. He was also questioning if we even need to define menswear and womenswear as separate. Why not put men in spaghetti strapped bodices made from Ziploc bags? Or turn women into bolshy, larger-than-life, puffer-jacketed figures? As you can see, that’s exactly what he did. Stefan Cooke’s placement in Paris wasn’t your average year in the industry. He worked as John Galliano’s research assistant while, unbeknown to Cooke, the designer was gathering material for his first collection under Maison Margiela. “He taught me to look at everything,” says the designer. “Open any book in a shop, and you’ll probably find one thing you love.” For Cooke’s award-winning final MA collection at CSM, he spent hours in charity shops, picking out “ordinary items” like Argyle jumpers, blue jeans bordering on ugly, rollnecks and leather coats. He photographed and digitally printed the spoils, turning them into new (and illusory) skintight items, at once ridiculously comfy and yet nothing like they seem. “It’s brilliant to see clothes that remind you of people-watching on the bus taken out of context,” says Cooke. “My sisters came to the show, saw the perspex vests and said, ‘It’s Dad!’ It wouldn’t surprise me if a lot of people saw their dad in these clothes.” James Crewe is spoiled for choice. If he could live in any other era, it would have to be 1930s Paris. “Montparnasse in the age of Brassaï’s Madame Bijou,” he muses. Then again, he quite fancies the idea of living as a medieval prince “in hose, cloth of silver, and my hair in tight ringlets”, too. The designer and model is a magpie like that, hoarding cultural and historical references in his mind, and stringing them all together into a gorgeous, mish-mashed vision. “I get quite ingrained in certain ideas, though I can switch easily,” he admits. “I suppose that’s what happens when you spent lunchtimes alone in the school library.” The story at play in his graduate collection? The two ill-fated Princes in the Tower, reputedly bumped off by their uncle, Richard III. “I reinvented the boys as pre-Renaissance princes who somehow come across Debbie Harry, and end up being corrupted by her purr.” Hence all the silver lamé: “I reimagined it as protective armour, slashed on the dancefloor at CBGB’s or Max’s Kansas City in 1970s New York.” Clothing is armour for 21-year-old Harris Reed. The more eye-catchingly flamboyant the dress, the thicker the barrier for the CSM BA student, a towering presence at 6ft 4in. “People used to tell me, ‘Wear what you want, just learn to run fast,’” the LA native explains. “That might work for some, but not for me. Every day is a stage; so I strut my stuff to Tesco Express and, when people heckle or harass me, I take it as a standing ovation!” This defiant attitude, the designs of Ann Demeulemeester and his fictional alias – a 19th-century gay urchin taking refuge in the baroque closets of an opera house – made up the moodboard for Reed’s final collection. Think ivory bodices, metallic flares and Yankee Doodle-feathered hats, as worn here by illustrator King Owusu. Soon enough, Reed’s work was gathering attention through Instagram, and Solange Knowles personally requested his designs for a shoot: “She’s a goddess, an activist and a mind-changer,” he says. “She represents who I design for almost more than anyone.” Glam, grotesque and funny ha-ha is the sartorial sweet-spot for CSM knitwear student Katya Zelentsova. A fan of the Peter Greenaway film Drowning by Numbers, the sensory overload of American artist Ryan Trecartin and ‘exquisite corpse’ (the surrealist parlour game that involves drawing body parts on folded bits of paper), off-the-wall humour is a common thread in her work. Zelentsova, pictured here with her friend and singer Cosima, likes to strip clothes of their original function, so that they take on a head-scratching silliness: “Like, ‘Oh! It’s a bra with ears,’” she laughs. Her love of crochet and Russian lace-making grew after she left her home country. “I grew up thinking Russian culture wasn’t cool, but you appreciate things from a distance and get nostalgic.” She made these pieces during a spell of heartbreak in New York. The therapeutic repetition of knitting and people-watching in Brighton Beach brought solace: “People there wear clothes everyone wore in Russia 20 years ago. It’s a bizarre place. But cool.” “When I was little, I would get my dad to draw figures for me, and I’d copy J.Lo’s outfits on to them,” says Manchester-born London College of Fashion graduate Maximilian Davis, pictured here with model and muse Jess Maybury. “People are scared to show their boobs. I mean, it’s provocative, but it’s just skin.” Davis decided to cut out the dress’s chest (worn by Maybury here) after seeing the Caravaggio painting The Seven Works of Mercy. In the Renaissance artist’s masterwork, a woman stuffs one of her breasts through the bars of a prison, offering her milk up to a man inside. “I went to Catholic school,” he laughs. “You can see my rebellion against that in my work.” Next up for Davis is a new job at Wales Bonner. He’s interned and modelled for the influential designer since she spotted him working at Selfridges. “She sent me a Facebook message like, ‘I saw the back of your head, it was amazing and beautiful,’” he grins. The rest is history. Like many teenagers from seaside towns, Sam Chester felt apathetic towards Hastings, the Sussex enclave where coach-loads of tourists turn up in search of spiritual or archeological evidence of a very old battle. Since leaving, though, they’ve been drawn back to images of the coastline (plastic beach lint, old rope, neoprene surf shoes) and the importance in coastal communities of passing down skills from generation to generation. “My dad taught me how to make sculptures from willow, and I wanted to continue but none of the basketry classes in London were affordable,” says the designer, who ended up taking a course at a church hall in Hastings. They experimented with sculptures that twisted around the body, utilising willow’s bendiness when soaked in water. “The sculptures represented my own feelings of being ‘caged’ within my body,” says Chester, pictured here with sister Emily. “She’s one of my biggest critics! But she’s earned the right. She’s suffered a lot of scrapes while I tried to perfect the final shape.” Muscle patches – those unsexy stickers used for knee sprains and sore joints – found a new use in Xiaoming Shan’s final collection, leaving impressions of nipples as they were stuck to the body. “The patches are for people to stick or remove as they like,” says Shan, who believes these playful adhesives remind us to embody beauty on our own terms. Paired with giant mobile-like shapes of polyester and silk, the result is a fun, vivid collection flitting between art and fashion. There are colourful echoes of the Memphis Group, the 1980s Italian design movement, or the birds that puff their feathers as part of wild mating dances in nature documentaries. “The garments can be anything you think they are,” says Shan, though adorning the body with a sort of graffiti was the guiding idea. Next, he hopes to set up shop with his own label. “I don’t want to follow fashions or other designers’ ways of creating brands. I want to create something new – something more artistic, but still wearable.” “I remember workers renovating my family home – the way they carefully covered our pink and orange hydrangeas with a shiny protective foil,” says Peter Movrin. “I found it so beautiful.” Amid the “ghastly uncertainty” of today, Movrin was drawn to that evocative Quality Street palette, or in fact anything that winked with unadulterated pleasure. “I created my own universe of elegance and glamour,” he explains. “It’s something we lack at the moment. I was thinking about workwear references, and the way the precarious meets the glamorous, obscuring the line between the so-called bourgeois and the proletarian.” Stitching together organza, foil and butcher’s paper (stolen from his family’s business), he married cheap with expensive – an apt ambiguity, given the trend for telling public porkies about what one can or cannot afford on social media. In this sense, the internet is another place for proletarians to play dress-up. More fun and foil: that’s what the world needs right now. “We saw a video of her on top of a mountain in Bulgaria, dressed in full costume doing Beyonce’s Single Ladies dance.” says Emma Chopova, explaining how she and design partner Laura Lowena came across artist Gery Georgieva. Georgieva - like Chopova - moved away from Bulgaria at a young age and shares a visual preoccupation with honouring and even prodding at their homeland’s traditions. Chopova and Lowena, who’re the second design duo to complete the MA Fashion course together at CSM (the first was Marques’Almeida) are interested in how people mix everyday clothes with costume; whether that’s traditional folk dress, or a uniform of some sort - in this case, 1980s rock climbing kit. Seeing a photograph of the French climber Catherine Destivelle in spandex laden with climbing clips was one catalyst, the other was a folk costume festival in a Bulgarian forest. “You had to be in traditional dress or you weren't allowed inside, Chopova says. “It was a magical, mystical place, and a lot of women were wearing sneakers under their big dresses, or their own t-shirts layered underneath, which gave this strange combination of old and new.” It was a reflection of how most people really dress - sometimes a piece of clothing is a cherished or conscious statement, and sometimes it’s just chucked on. “Seeing how people mix their own clothes has always been an important aesthetic to us.” Have you ever seen a Biedermeier china doll? They’re portly things, with long foreheads and cheeks like slapped bottoms. They’re sort of gormless but graceful too; something to do with stuffed linen bodices and their look of certainty. Preparing his final BA collection, womenswear designer Jordan Dalah was struck by them: “I wanted to treat each of the looks as if it is a different doll.” He says. Growing up in Australia, Dalah - who is half Hungarian - was obsessed with painting Tudor portraiture, and he set out to mimic both pigments and process. He chose leather in rich cherry, moss and cornflower blue, lining it all with hand-washed natural linen to emphasise this idea of paint being applied to a canvas. With careful attention to the way a fold catches a shadow, he struck a balance between classical Flemish painting (see those pillowy Jan Van Eyck-ish hats), and the rituals of Tudor dress. The winklepickers were inspired by men’s square-toed Tudor shoes: “They were handmade by my friend who makes shoes for mock medieval festivals - those reenactments in the countryside where everyone pretends to battle!”

"If you’re reading Dazed, you probably don’t need any introduction to Chloë Sevigny. Over the years, the American actress and model has captivated us with her acting abilities and great sense of style. Now, you can dress just like her – with a collection of her clothes up for sale on The RealReal. Announced on her Instagram account, Sevigny told followers to “shop my closet” with #springcleaning. “I think sites like The RealReal are very important in helping people satisfy that urge without contributing more waste which is, unfortunately, such an industry-wide problem,” she said in an article on the Metro. Back in 2016, she teased pieces of her archive – like the bunny ears made famous in the 1997 Harmony Korine film Gummo – with the caption “SAVE YOUR LUNCH MONEY, KIDS” Unsurprisingly, most of the items up for grabs were snatched up immediately, but there are still lots of options from Gucci, Proenza Schouler, Rodarte, and one of those Louis Vuitton x Jeff Koons handbags. With prices starting at £46, there is a chance for almost everyone to get involved. As if this wasn’t cause for celebration already, a portion of the proceeds will go to the Hetrick-Martin Institute, a non-profit LGBTQ organisation and youth service based in New York.

"On Saturday, amid the chaos of LFWM, 1 Granary debuted the latest chapter of VOID – a unique exhibition documenting the work of some of London’s most exciting young fashion talents – and, for the first time, an accompanying limited edition publication. Ripping up the rule book as to what traditionally constitutes a magazine, the initiative presented six separate zines, with each one dedicated to a specific designer. Working with their creative teams, each had full control over everything: from the layout and imagery, right through to the actual contents and even the binding. Among the designers invited to contribute this season were Charlotte Knowles, whose work aims to dismantle and reconstruct the idea of feminine sexuality, Sinead O’Dwyer, who explores female body image and perception through her wildly beautiful works in silicone, and CSM graduate Rebecca Jeffs, who is intent on deconstructing the codes of womanhood with her progressive, imaginative womenswear. “New designers are turned into rising stars rather that being given the time to grow and develop their work” – Aya Noël On the line-up of established industry talents were the likes of Sharna Osborne, Thurstan Redding, Harley Weir, and Ibrahim Kamara. Since its inception in 2017, VOID has been focused on supporting emerging designers as they make their way in fashion, linking them up not only with collaborators, but, perhaps more importantly, enabling them to build a network that will help them navigate the industry’s challenges in the early days of their career. As plans began coming together for the latest iteration of VOID, it was conversations surrounding these issues that were at the forefront of editor Aya Noël’s mind, as they discussed the ever-increasing pace of fashion, status anxiety, and more. “We talked a lot about the pressures of being young and finding your place in the industry,” she explained prior to the launch. “New designers are turned into rising stars rather that being given the time to grow and develop their work.” With that in mind, we caught up with Jeffs, O'Dwyer, and Knowles and her partner Alexandre Arsenault to talk about their experience of working on VOID, what they’re taking away from the project, and the ways in which they hope to make an impact on the fashion industry. Creative Director: Jasmine Raznahan Photographer: Sharna Osborne Stylist: Danielle Emerson “I’ve always been fascinated by the relationship between creative expression and the body, so I was naturally drawn towards fashion design and performance, and I love how many crafts, disciplines, and experts come together within the fashion industry – and that fashion design and imagery are so important to forming identity. On the other hand, though, fashion reinforces many ideals of elitism in relation to body shape and size, race, and class, starting with its educational institutions and running right through to the high street. With my work, I hope to change the idea that the design process needs to start with a tall, slim models, and that the beginning point and body ideal can include larger volumes, form, and sizing. Working as a young designer is difficult because you need money to start out, but it’s really hard to focus on your brand development when you’re always working other jobs to pay for your expenses. I’m so lucky to have the support of 1 Granary, to be able to reach out to them for advice and to answer questions, but in general I think it’s hard to figure out what to do in terms of business when you graduate and want to start out on your own. There’s not much room for trial and error, which can be really intimidating. “I’ve always been fascinated by the relationship between creative expression and the body, so I was naturally drawn towards fashion design and performance” – Sinead O’Dwyer Working on VOID has been amazing, I love what Jasmine, Sharna, Danielle, and I created. The project has helped me generate visual imagery that really begins to represent my world as a designer. It was such an amazing opportunity to see Jasmine and Sharna collaborate and generate ideas together with so much confidence and I was really inspired by them both. The dynamic on set between Sharna and Danielle, the stylist, was also really cool to watch, they are such a team. When we met for the first time we all instantly agreed on our model Agusta. Then a story built itself around her and her persona and the collection. We wanted to create a sort of abstract narrative of Agusta in different scenarios which we did using different sets, props and styling. Before when I’ve created visuals I think I could be quite controlling: I wanted to get all the details, to get the colours just right, and sometimes it would end up more like a lookbook. With VOID it was an opportunity to let Jasmine and Sharna take over. It wasn’t about shooting all the looks – I wanted it to be something much more raw than anything I’d created before.” DJA (Creative Director Marina Francisco) Photographer: Chris Rhodes Video: Albert Moya Stylist: Danielle van Camp “I started thinking about working in fashion when I realised it was a form of expression that allows you to create characters and a world of your own, which is still ultimately connected to reality. My work, overall, is a representation of how we see femininity and what it means to be a woman. Fashion is a form of discourse which is continuously re-defining and ‘improving’ our idea of that, and in the future, I hope to see other designers approaching womenswear with a higher level of sensitivity and intellectual rigeur. I feel very comfortable within my realm of design and creation, but I do feel the pressure when it comes to balancing and negotiating all the other elements that come into play, things like press and marketing and so on. In fashion, there’s an incredible mix of highly passionate and creative people, but for many there’s a real pressure to keep up with the speed at which it currently moves. My project was all about documenting a woman in her personal creative space, how her body language interacted with the clothes. It’s quite light-hearted and a little surreal. We wanted to cultivate an atmosphere in which the images read as self-timed photographs and still lifes, and we referenced performance art, as well as the rituals attached to both the utility and uselessness of clothing to evoke a new meaning for the viewer. The woman in focus is the author of her own gaze. There was an immediate and instinctive connection between everyone I worked with on VOID, and a mutual understanding of what the work is all about. Each person brought a new and distinct perspective to the collection.” Creative Director: Ted Lovett Stylist: Georgia Pendlebury Photographer: Harley Weir “Charlotte was interested in fashion from a young age – her grandma owned a small boutique and was very stylish - whereas I wanted to study art but ended up finding out about the likes of Rick Owens and Alexander McQueen on a number of forums and was swayed into pursuing that instead. There’s real power in youth in London fashion. A new generation are cultivating things here which is really exciting. As a brand, we’re intent on proposing a new archetype within fashion - creating a new wardrobe for the strong women populating the world of today and tomorrow. Or how we imagine it at least. Our VOID project revolved around intimacy and femininity: we were talking about a woman that could be the emblem of this, a kind of Aphrodite figure, who’s primitive, sensual, and dangerous. The shoot itself was great. We went to a big estate in the country and shot our model, Amalia, around the grounds and inside the house. Everyone we worked with was incredibly passionate, there was no pretentious attitude and it felt very natural. I hope they felt the same way about us, we can be pretty obsessive about the smallest of details.” (Alexandre Arsenault) VOID is available to buy now. Get your copy here.

"At the beginning of the year, Gucci announced that it would be donating $500,000 in support of ‘March For Our Lives’ – a march that followed the tragic school shooting in Parkland, Florida killing 17 people. Taking a similar stance on the issue of gun violence – which is estimated to have killed 9,879 people in America in 2018 alone – is denim brand Levi’s. “Americans shouldn’t have to live in fear of gun violence,” president and CEO Chip Bergh told Fortune. “While taking a stand can be unpopular with some, doing nothing is no longer an option.” In support of gun control, the company has started the ‘Safer Tomorrow Fund’ which will give over $1million over the next four years to help support non-profits and young activists who are campaigning to end gun violence in the US. Elsewhere, Levi’s is also encouraging its employees to get involved, giving them 60 hours a year of paid volunteer time, which Bergh is urging them to use towards the gun control efforts. “As a company, we have never been afraid to take an unpopular stand to support a greater good,” Bergh continues, noting the support Levi’s has pledged to racial equality and the LGBTQ+ community in the 165 years it has been around. “While each one of these stands may have been controversial at the time, history proved the company right in the long run. And I’m convinced that while some will disagree with our stand to end gun violence, history will prove this position right too.”

"Have you ever wondered what £15k worth of Louis Vuitton handbags would look like broken down and reconstructed into a toilet? Of course you have! But if you’re struggling to imagine what it might look like, it’s your lucky day because artist Illma Gore has created a golden toilet made entirely from LV bags. Not that anybody asked... The artist – who is known for creating that naked Trump portrait (complete with micropenis) – created the fully-functional toilet for online retailer Tradesy and it is currently on sale in LA for £76,000. Unfortunately the toilet does not come with LV-branded toilet roll, but you could probably use a couple of 100 dollar bills if you’ve got money to fork out on it. “I personally love the idea of what it felt like to cut up a $2000 bag,” Gore said on creating the toilet. “The urge to destroy is just the same as a creative urge.” Gore’s other items available on the site include an LV-monogram bust of Abraham Lincoln and a Gucci-print missile – because what else could you possibly need for your house?

"If you’re not familiar with GAIKA’s The Spectacular Empire, it’s an ongoing project by the multi-disciplinary artist (and Dazed political editor-at-large) that combines music and fashion while looking unfalteringly towards the future. Following the release of his recent EP, GAIKA presented his latest collection under the label Armour in Heaven, created in partnership with emerging London-based designer (MA) Menikmati. Held during LFW Men’s earlier this month, the presentation took the form of a party that blended music, visuals, and fashion and was hosted at Ace Hotel’s restaurant Hoi Polloi. Entitled Unnatural Systems 2110 – Phase 3, the collection itself was produced using cutting-edge technology to create four future-forward uniforms. Made from upcycled materials, translucent fabrics, and skin-like fine latex, the line was expanded upon and further explored through GAIKA’s music and film narrative throughout the night. Shot during the evening's event, this new film features three repetitive sequences filmed in atmospheric black-and-white, as the models move around the space wearing the futuristic attire. Watch the video above.

"Tom of Finland’s work is instantly recognisable. Always homoerotic and often featuring stereotypes of gay men with bulging muscles and even bigger bulging appendages, it’s not exactly hard to notice. One person who has always been captivated by the work is designer Nicola Formichetti. Now he’s taking his love of it one step further, launching a collaboration with his brand Nicopanda and the Tom of Finland Foundation. “I have always been a fan and collector of Tom of Finland so for me, it is a natural partnership. When I visited the Tom of Finland Foundation in LA, there was mutual love and admiration so I wanted to bring together the world of Nicopanda and Tom of Finland through this collaboration,” said Formichetti who is supporting the Tom of Finland Foundation with a percentage of the proceeds contributing to help promote and preserve erotic art. In addition to supporting the Foundation, the collaboration launches in line with NYC’s Pride, a celebration that Formichetti feels strongly about. For him, “Gay Pride is a time of celebration and unity – it’s the perfect time and place to celebrate Nicopanda’s collaboration with Tom of Finland. We need to unite during these times – bring together all types of people to celebrate great creativity and artwork regardless of gender, sexual preference, or skin colour. Participating in Pride this year with this project is important to me.” The accompanying lookbook – shot and styled by Formichetti himself – shows a clear blend of both creatives. Those who aren’t gay men need not worry because the collection is made for everyone – girls too. “I really love the idea of girls wearing Tom of Finland hoodies, t-shirts, tanks, and bomber jackets. I love that the bomber jacket and faux-fur coat are lined in pink with the artwork of this legendary artist – it’s very cheeky.” With its penis patches and tees depicting embracing, erect men it is likely you’ll be turning heads just like Tom of Finland’s work always does.

"Fashion’s obsession with the idea of the teenage boy runs deep. While this idea manifests itself in many different ways – from rebel to raver – it filters into countless collections and fashion images. This is the subject of a new exhibition – aptly titled Mad About The Boy – coming to the Fashion Space Gallery at the London College of Fashion. Curated by SHOWstudio’s editor Lou Stoppard, the exhibition will bring together work from some of this generation’s most feted creative talents: Raf Simons, Larry Clark, Meadham Kirchhoff, Gosha Rubchinskiy, J.W.Anderson, Larry Clark, Kim Jones, Tyrone Lebon and Nasir Mazhar. “The fluidity and possibility of the teenage years seems to unite fashion’s obsession with the boy: sparked, perhaps by a strange belief in the precious genius of youth – of a time of perceived infinite opportunity, spontaneity and creative freedom,” Stoppard explains. “Designers young and old return to the same themes, constructing, rehashing and shaping the dream male, season in season out.” Opening in January 2016, Mad About The Boy will come in conjunction with a series of talks, workshops and masterclasses. Here Stoppard explains more about the project: Can you give us a brief outline of this exhibition? Lou Stoppard: The exhibition deals with fashion’s interest in and portrayal of the teenage boy. It’s not so much about how teenagers themselves dress, more about how fashion constructs ideals of the young male. We’re not organising the work by designer or artist, but by theme – the notions and tropes that come up again and again: the boy as outsider, the boy as sexual being, the boy in the club, the boy in education. There will be a whole mixture of stuff featured – clothing, photography, ephemera. I’m not really looking to answer questions with the show, more provoke discussion and get young people to consider how youth is portrayed and obsessed over. What sparked the idea? Lou Stoppard: Lots of things. The fetishisation of youth is always something that has interested me... Some recent interviews I’ve done on SHOWstudio where I realised how nostalgic many creatives are for their youth – they see it, no matter what they've subsequently achieved, as this precious time of creative freedom and possibility. I wondered if that view somehow affected the way they went on to portray youth and young males in their own work. I also think you can’t ignore what's going on in fashion news. Some of the most discussed designers at the moment, Raf Simons, Gosha Rubchinskiy, Hedi Slimane are all youth obsessives. “Some of the most discussed designers at the moment, Raf Simons, Gosha Rubchinskiy, Hedi Slimane are all youth obsessives” – Lou Stoppard What are your highlights of it? Lou Stoppard: All the work is brilliant. I think it’s the mix that makes it special, to have early Kim Jones work next to recent Christopher Shannon or Raf Simons. Or original Nick Knight Skinhead prints next to new work by Tyrone Lebon or Jason Evans. I’m thrilled also to be able to restage a bit of a Meadham Kirchhoff presentation, SS13. It was such a special collection and display and I think so many people miss the label and their amazing work, so it’s great even more people will be able to see it and that their legacy will be celebrated. Obviously there's some amazing contributors, who's involvement are you most excited about and why? Lou Stoppard: It’s such a pleasure to collaborate with Tony Hornecker on the set. He did the amazing sets for all those great Meadham Kirchhoff shows so it’s really fitting. The way he’s staging the objects is so exciting – I hope it will surprise people and offer something new in terms of what people expect from a fashion exhibition. Why do you think fashion is so obsessed with youth culture? Lou Stoppard: I guess that’s what I’m trying to explore with the show – I wish I had the answer. I do think it has something to do with designers or image-makers reliving or revisiting their own adolescences – they’ll often use their platform to create things that always wanted to be a part of. That’s why so many pay homage to their favourite musicians or what-have-you. The spector of creatives’ youths is never far from their work! Why should people come to this? Lou Stoppard: I hope because it poses questions. It’s not a show dedicated to one designer or one medium, so in some ways it’s a bit strange and tricky. But I hope because of that people will impose a lot of their own thoughts and narratives onto things and start asking questions. I think the objects and images really speak for themselves and can’t help but spark conversation. Mad About The Boy will run January 8– April 2, 2016 at Fashion Space Gallery, London College of Fashion, 20 John Prince’s Street, London, W1G 0BJ

"Harry Styles loves Gucci. Just look at his tour outfits: both onstage and off he’s always wearing the Italian label’s looks. Clearly the feeling is mutual, with creative director Alessandro Michele tapping the musician as the face of its new tailoring campaign. Following on from Dapper Dan – who fronted last season’s campaign – Styles appears in the images shot by Glen Luchford. Set in a chip shop, the musician is dressed in the 60s-tinged collection, wearing suits with embellished lapels and emblazoned with ‘NY’ – and completes all the looks with a pet chicken. In an accompanying video, the chicken appears again as Styles journeying to the chip shop, but leaving his “accessory” behind. And now that Styles has a Gucci campaign under his belt, hopefully, it won’t be long before he makes a runway appearance. Alessandro, it’s up to you.

"Today in Milan, Bottega Veneta celebrated its fiftieth anniversary with a show that pulled out all the stops. Ditching their usual venue for a museum in the city’s centre, creative director Tomas Maier debuted a super luxe SS17 collection on a smash hit cast of models. From Guinevere Van Seenus, to Bella Hadid and her sister Gigi, Pat Cleveland’s daughter Anna and Victoria’s Secret Angel Adriana Lima, the casting crossed both generations and genres of modeling. But the show was truly stolen by the legendary Lauren Hutton, who strolled out in a trench coat with a smile. It was a nod to both Hutton and the brand’s history – her look was a tribute to an outfit she wears in 1980 film American Gigolo, complete with the red ‘intrecciato’ clutch bag which Bottega is bringing back from the archives. As for the collection, coats came with collars in Bottega’s signature woven leather, in various shades of black and brown. Skirts and dresses also came in leather – in bright shades of of pink, red and camel. Elsewhere, the collection comprised of loose tailoring in pastel hues, while Gigi Hadid and Hutton closed the show in semi-matching ensembles, walking arm-in-arm in what was a symbolic meeting of two different generations of supermodel. Once Hadid and Hutton had made their way past the army of cameras and outstretched iPhones, Maier led a group of the house's stay down the runway. It was a touching finale to a fantastic show – and as the press notes commented, “Bottega veneta is about the craftspeople... They are the heart of the brand.”

"Water van Beirendonck has never shied away from politics, but it takes a special kind of designer to send out an anti-terrorism message in Paris just two weeks after one of France's deadliest terror attacks in decades. So hats off to the Antwerp Six founding member, who responded to the Charlie Hebdo shooting by opening his AW15 runway show with a see-through tunic bearing the words: ""Stop Terrorising Our World"". The slogan comes courtesy of his AW06 collection, also titled Stop Terrorising. Van Beirendonck told French newspaper Le Point why he was compelled to resurrect it. ""I brought back this slogan because of what happened in Paris two weeks ago,"" he said. ""Initially, I didn't want to make statements but when you see what is happening in the world, you must react."" But van Beirendonck also said he was not just responding to the tragic events at Charlie Hebdo – his collection, with appliques trumpeting ""Demand Beauty” and “Warning: Explicit Beauty"" – was also a reaction to another incident in Paris. Remember the city's green blow-up Christmas tree, the one that many thought resembled a giant green buttplug? Artist Paul McCarthy's installation prompted a rightwing backlash and even led to an attack on McCarthy himself. Vandals lated deflated the sculpture, and it was removed from Place Vendôme. Backstage, van Beirendonck expressed his disapproval of the censorship endured by McCarthy. ""He was really limited in expression,"" he said.

"How New York design collective Vaquera ended up creating a collection to coincide with dystopian Hulu series The Handmaid’s Tale is anyone’s guess, but they seem the perfect fit for dismantling oppression with their stereotype-averse garments. The Hulu series, which is now available to stream, is based on Margaret Atwood’s 1985 novel The Handmaid’s Tale. It takes place in a future society formerly known as the United States, called Gilead, where a totalitarian regime has risen to oppress its people. To offset a plunging birthrate, the remaining fertile women (a Handmaid named Offred, among them) are forced into sexual servitude in order to repopulate the world. Vaquera – which is Patric DiCaprio, Bryn Taubensee, David Moses, and Claire Sully – are creating a collection riffing on the outfits worn by those women groomed to bear children in a dystopian future. A bonnet and a red cape were all the designers had to go on as a starting point. “Our concept is to subvert the dystopian mode of dress in the story by creating Handmaid inspired looks that question oppression versus empowerment,” the collective says. “We are interested in discussing contemporary iterations of the Handmaid's uniform and the way they contrast with clothing that is designed to empower the wearer.” Atwood’s book returned to the bestseller list as President Trump took office back in January. The irony is not lost on Vaquera, who hope that their collection can speak to the suffocating oppression we face today. “The novel and show are reminders of the implications of a police state,” Vaquera continue. “We are interested in the similarities between our current political climate and the society described in the story. There are systems already in place that terrifyingly similar to those in the story.” The collection will be revealed this June, in a performance rather than a typical runway show. “We are exploring a more performative mode of presentation. We want to involve the audience more.”

"Alexander Wang took to the track to reveal his inaugural H&M collection in New York last night – or more accurately, he took over the Armory on the Hudson, a gargantuan indoor track and field complex in Harlem. The choice of location was more than calculated: basically, if you weren't already a gymn bunny, you left Wang's show wanting to drop twenty. The show's adrenalin-pumping opening featured free runners descending from the rafters to do parkour stunts and trampoline off the walls of the multi-level runway set. Then it was time for the collection to hit the stage, with Wang's sports-inspired aesthetic taking front and centre: activewear as interpreted in neoprene scuba caps, knitted two-pieces and football vest-inspired tops and bras. Hardbody women like Anna Ewers and beefy male models were the order of the day, tattooed in strips of black athletic tape and holding onto Wang-branded sports gear like hockey sticks and boxing gloves. After Wang did his signature lap around the runway for his bow, people scrambled for the pop-up store in a locker room set. The whole night was capped off with a gig from NJ rapper Sharaya J and a surprise performance from her hip-hop mentor – the one and only Missy Elliott, who performed ""Get Ur Freak On"" and ""Work It"". ""Tonight’s event for the launch was about high energy and a full experience that goes beyond fashion; from the attitude and speed of the show, to the pop-up store in a locker-room setting, and the performances by Missy and Sharaya J at the after party,” Wang said. “I wanted for everyone to be able to just let go and have fun and hopefully we achieved that tonight.” Either that or he just gave everyone a serious case of gym envy.

"Last night, Raf Simons made his New York Fashion Week Men’s debut with a show that paid homage to the Big Apple – the city he now calls home, thanks to his new role as chief creative officer of Calvin Klein. Simons was in the middle of designing this collection when Donald Trump was elected President of the US. Backstage he said that he couldn’t help but speak up and bring a “kind of energy” that stands against the intolerance and hate the new POTUS embodies. His cast donned garments emblazoned with slogans such as “YOUTH PROJECT”, “OUT OF THIS NIGHTMARE” and “I ❤️ NY”, along with droopy sweaters, woollen arm warmers and belts made from duct tape – things that seemed to hint at the notion of security and protection. At the same time, his models wore necklaces that looked almost like rosary beads. The show represented a major moment for New York menswear which has struggled to generate the same amount of excitement as the other fashion capitals. Charged with the energy and fresh ideas that Simons is almost singularly capable of, the show feels like the first bit of good news to come from across the pond in a while – except perhaps that of Beyoncé’s pregnancy. Stay tuned for Patrik Sandberg’s review of the show.

"Yesterday, upon entering the Givenchy show space in Paris, we were confronted by a horrific car crash. Shards of glass were littered across the floor, vehicles were disturbingly intertwined and for the duration of the show, masses of smoke emerged from the wreckage. This wasn’t just a prop, or some sort of spectacle; the installation felt alive – steaming, pulsating and exuding a strange sort of energy. an undercurrent of fetishism ran through the collection It was only when the models began circling the wreckage, skin on show and draped in fabric so tight that it revealed every inch of body, that it raised the possibility that this season Riccardo Tisci was aligning sex and destruction. As his spectacular collection unraveled and hypnotic smoke continued to fill the show space, David Cronenberg’s highly charged 1996 film Crash came to mind. It’s a film that deals with sexual taboos. More importantly, it explores one that’s still very controversial – car crash sex, the sexual gratification from potential life-destroying events. Much like Crash, an undercurrent of fetishism ran through the collection. Tisci’s models emerged on the runway concealed under a mass of Swarovski crystals. From a distance, it appeared to be some sort of mask – which suggestively only left their mouths exposed – but it soon became apparent that this was the result of a strange and almost ritualistic 12-hour transformation process. Then came the body harnesses, another exercise into restriction, and the collections’ metallic colour palette – a cross section of yellows, reds and silvers which evoked the trance-like state of terror and shock. Imagine all the blurring colours you would witness mid crash. It ignited a sense of chaos and disorder, much like the scene of the wreckage itself. But to be clear, this collection was not about car crash sex. However, Tisci’s decision to use a smoking crash as the backdrop for the collection wasn’t an impromptu one – it was a statement. When you think about the other great shows we’ve seen in Paris – Comme des Garçons for example, where Rei Kawakubo sent out her collection to a disruptive and highly uncomfortable soundtrack (leaving everyone on edge) – none offered such dangerous or destructive offerings. What Tisci achieved yesterday was something else entirely. He forced his audiences to align two components – beauty and harrowing devastation. Tisci had left us fetishising the crash By the end of the show, as audiences rushed to the crash installation to begin taking photographs, I couldn’t help but think that Tisci had left us fetishising the crash. We’d spent the last thirty minutes watching it, accepting that this kind of destruction had a place in fashion. And enjoying it. Much like Cronenberg's characters, who fetishise cars and the sexual high of a crash experience, had we just succumbed to the same taboo?

"For adidas Originals’ latest release, the German sportswear label turns its attention to the streets, and, more importantly, to what’s going on on them after dark. Joining forces with South London electronic duo Mount Kimbie and former Dazed 100 filmmaker Frank Lebon, adidas’ newest iteration of the classic Nite Jogger silhouette is worn by a number of rising talents, as part of a short film which debuts today. Including New York rapper Wiki, London singer Obongjayar, and Tokyo-based spoken word poet Cai, they are the creatives who “come alive as most of the city readies to close its eyes,” a voiceover asserts. A series of images which demonstrate the dynamism of a city after dark were also shot by London-based artist Bafic to accompany the video. The sneakers themselves are constructed using lightweight nylon ripstop, and utilise the style’s signature hi-vis, reflective technology. Sitting atop an innovative BOOST midsole, they’re finished with a message reading ‘speed of nite’ written in Morse code to the tongue and outsole. Check out the full video below.

"The most memorable thing to pop up on my Instagram explore page recently was a meme that read: “2018’s nearly over y’all, and all I’ve got to say is what the fuck was that?” A sentiment shared by many after a year that was, to say the least, a political, social, emotional, technological, and environmental shitshow. One thing we could rely on through it all, though, was the fashion industry’s ability to tap into this whirling cultural maelstrom and deliver us some zeitgeisty material to wrap our brains around and put our bodies into. Only this year, it wasn’t human bodies that fashion was interested in, but rather those of a new generation of CGI models. As the IRL world becomes ever more disturbing, fashion appears to be seeking solace in the realm of AI and tech, blurring the increasingly wobbly parameters of reality with a new generation of digitally rendered avatars. At the forefront of this bold new world was Miquela Sousa, better known by her social media handle @lilmiquela. Created back in 2016, Miquela is the frontrunner of a new pool of artificial influencers which includes characters such as Perl, Lil Wavi, Miquela’s sometime sidekick Blawko, and his girlfriend Bermuda. Now commanding a following of 1.5 million and counting, 2018 was arguably the year Miquela made the leap from novelty internet sensation to legitimate industry player. While the perpetual 19-year-old – who we first featured back in 2016 – has always been known for her keen fashion sense, routinely rendered wearing the latest labels and trends, 2018 saw brands tripping over themselves to court her. Back in February, Miuccia enlisted her to take over the Prada Instagram at its AW18 show, before Pat McGrath gave her a shout out on her own platform. The legendary make-up artist declared that she was: “SO SHOOK to DEBUT my LATEST MESMERISING #McGrathMuse @lilmiquela”. Magazines couldn’t get enough of her, either, with the digital superstar appearing in editorials for V, Interview and Vogue (in the September issue, no less), and covering independent titles including 032c, Wonderland, Highsnobiety, and King Kong. She has also fronted campaigns for brands such as Outdoor Voices and UGG, and collaborated with various streetwear and fashion labels, frequently using these as opportunities to raise money for activist causes such as RAICES, a refugee charity, and Trans Lifeline. Since its launch, Miquela has also been appointed as Dazed Beauty’s very own arts editor, and was named as one of Time’s 25 most influential people on the internet (...no big deal). Another notable CGI personality is fashionista Noonoouri. With her Bratz doll-like cartoon eyes (decorated with Kim Kardashian’s KKW make-up line no less) Noonoouri is the creation of art director Joerg Zuber, who launched her back in February this year. Whereas Miquela is more in tune with the street, Noonoouri is a luxury lifestyle player, appearing immaculately polished in current season looks from the likes of Dior, Jacquemus, and Off-White. Her feed is peppered with short, ethereal videos, executed with the glossy fantasy of a luxury campaign. She defines herself as “cute, curious, and couture”, and recently graced the cover of Madame Figaro alongside Carine Roitfeld, before ‘attending’ Dior’s 2019 cruise show back in May – where she took over the label’s Instagram for the evening. “As the IRL world becomes ever more disturbing, fashion appears to be seeking solace in the realm of AI and tech – blurring the increasingly wobbly parameters of reality with a new generation of digitally rendered avatars” While Miquela and Noonoouri might better fit the category of multi-hyphenate influencer/model, other CGI girls fit more neatly into the role of traditional mannequin. E-commerce site Yoox this week launched a “fashion-conscious avatar called Daisy”, who will try on outfits in the CGI YOOXMIRROR suite, modelling clothes for you to consider. CGI model Shudu claims to be ‘The World’s First Digital Supermodel’, despite only existing since 2017. The creation of British photographer Cameron-James Wilson, this year Shudu featured in editorials for Cosmopolitan and Vogue Australia, and also scored a campaign for Balmain, in which she appears alongside robo-girls Margo and Zhi. Dubbed the ‘Virtual Balmain Army’, the models are signed with ‘The Diigitals’ – a digital modelling agency which describes itself as a place where “a portfolio of diverse digital identities can be appreciated.” Such claims of diversity have given rise to controversy, however, particularly in Shudu’s case. While the fact it seems to be mostly male creators behind these female avatars feels distinctly Pygmalion-esque, many argued in particular that a black female character created by a white man further perpetuates a damaging history of cultural appropriation. “It’s objectification in its purest form. Now brands can borrow Shudu’s deep melanated skin and Miquela’s feisty online persona without the hassle of smashing the glass ceiling to let POC reach the top,” explained Kemi Alemoru, as she argued against the rise of CGI models of colour earlier this year. Debate has also ensued as to how these new digital models might impact the careers of real models, channelling more widespread fears about robots replacing humans in the workforce. One brand directly addressing this uneasy subtext is, of course, Balenciaga. The primary proponent of high fashion satire and acerbic cultural commentary, the label recently released a digital campaign featuring CGI models, but not as you’ve seen them before. The campaign shows a number of artificially rendered figures who, as they are being watched, begin to bend and contort into weird, inhuman shapes. This uncanny imagery reflects the general anxiety about what such technology means for the future of reality in the digital age. But hey, we’re all essentially avatars of ourselves on Instagram – so having actual avatars front fashion campaigns is pretty much our culture’s logical next step.

"Luxury accessories brand MCM are teaming up with contemporary British designer Christopher Raeburn for the forthcoming London Collections: Men. Fusing the German label’s heritage with Raeburn’s sophisticated approach to technical sportswear, they’re set to debut a collaboration which will champion sustainability, whilst also creating a unisex capsule collection fit to serve as a modular uniform for “the modern-day global nomad”. In the past the designer – who was voted 2015’s Breakthrough Designer of the Year by British GQ – has taken used military parachutes and Swedish field garments, reimagining them into ready-to-wear pieces. Here, the same approach is applied to a full capsule collection, with items inspired by MCM’s iconic Visetos canvas. MCM have also made recent efforts to embrace the sustainable, with both brands’ shared focus on travel, deconstruction, and functionality making them fitting partners. The unveiling of the collection, set to happen on 11th of June, was conceived in partnership with design studio Universal Everything and, according to Raeburn, has been created to reflect “the experience of someone who travels and lives fluidly between cities and countries that really represents a new generation. A generation that is made to move.” Of the collaboration itself, Raeburn chimed: “I think MCM is an incredibly forward-thinking brand in taking this collaboration for their 40th anniversary. It makes a clear statement about sustainability and MCM’s intentions to continue their work with innovation.” As the discourse surrounding fast fashion and our attitudes towards sustainability grows ever-louder, it’s reassuring to see luxury labels beginning to react positively to the issues currently facing the fashion industry.

"We’re not entirely sure how it’s happened so fast, but we’re already in August – meaning 2020 is just around the corner. And what does a new year bring? A new Pirelli calendar, obvs. With legendary photographer Paolo Roversi at the helm this time around, the calendar’s theme centres around Shakespeare’s Juliet, as the likes of Indya Moore, Mia Goth, Emma Watson, Kristen Stewart, Rosalia, Yara Shahidi and Chris Lee step into the role of the star-crossed lover. In anticipation of the calendar’s launch, Pirelli now releases a series of behind-the-scenes photographs of next year’s stars at work. With Stewart shown lying across a table and Rosalia standing in front of a number of glowing church candles, Roversi is seen directing them how to pose and capturing their individual interpretations of who Juliet actually is. Though, as the photographer himself puts it: “I am still searching for my Juliet and I will be searching all of my life. Because Juliet is a dream.” Over the course of the last few years we’ve seen Albert Watson celebrate the women chasing their dreams as part of a largely monochrome edition of the calendar, Tim Walker paint a portrait of black excellence featuring Naomi Campbell, RuPaul, and Puff Daddy, and Peter Lindbergh release a completely unretouched iteration in 2017. Stay tuned to see exactly what the final 2020 version looks like. Check out the gallery above.

"The archetypal Victoria Beckham woman is sexy but sophisticated; buttoned-up but never uptight. This week's AW15 show in New York was a case in point, with its clingy knits, slim-cut coats and largely monochrome palette – but a new behind-the-scenes film shows another side to the classic polish. You'd normally associated GoPro cameras with extreme sports videos, but Beckham has been using one to cover her shows for the past four seasons (you can watch one GoPro-enabled stream for SS15 here). In a twist on the selfie stick phenom, she enlisted nine of the models in her show to tote around a GoPro before the show: Maartje Verhoef, Julia Nobis, Mica Arganaraz, Alexandra Elizabeth, Julie Hoomans, Emmy Rappe, Julia Hafstrom, Julia van Os and Irina Schnitman. Creative director Jonny Lu with D.O.P. Cameron Smith built a customised GoPro harness worn by the models. They say Fashion Week is an endurance sport – now you've got the GoPro footage to prove it.

"Oh, the life of a model, plucked from obscurity and thrust into fashion’s glaring spotlight. A crazy schedule of castings, long days, late nights and parties, and the rush that come from stepping onto the catwalks of some of the most talented designers – Rick Owens, Raf Simons, Demna Gvasalia and Shayne Oliver among them. That is, if it’s German agency Tomorrow Is Another Day that’s snapped them up. Founded by Eva Gödel in 2010, the agency and its boys have challenged the concept of muscular, hyper-masculine male models and literally changed the face of menswear in the seven years since its inception. With photographers, artists, musicians and designers amongst them, the agency is much more than just its unconventionally pretty faces too – the boys of Tomorrow Is Another Day are known for their character and creativity, much in the same way as the progressive brands they model for are. “I’m getting to work with people that don’t just stand there and do a job, they have character. And then they become friends” – Paul Anton Herrmann That creativity lying within the agency’s ranks has resulted in a short film this season – Yellow Days, shot by model Paul Anton Herrmann. Berlin-based Herrmann made his debut in Gosha Rubchinskiy’s SS17 show in Florence and was signed to Tomorrow Is Another Day soon after, but he’s also a self-taught filmmaker and photographer. Yellow Days follows a number of Gödel’s recruits as they skate and smoke their way through the SS18 edition of Paris Fashion Week, including Jakob E, Anton J, and Leon D. Hermann set out to capture the raw moments between the shows – as he put it, “just our life during fashion week. Walking to and from venues, skating, drinking together in the evening.” And if you were wondering about the name? “Yellow Days comes from a song I listened to on the train to Paris and I thought it fit really well – the whole time we were in the city it was like 36 degrees!” Shot on an old VHS camera, the model cites Dexter Navy (whose other fans include M.I.A. and A$AP Rocky) as an influence, but says that he’s just as inspired by his best friend Steffan Grap (founder of skate brand Champagne Towers – “he’s always the first to see anything I do, and the other way around”) and the boys that make up the agency’s books, who make great subjects for budding filmmakers. “The modelling industry seems to have changed a lot and, in my eyes, that’s really good – I’d rather shoot interesting people that have something to say. At Tomorrow Is Another Day, I’m getting to work with people that don’t just stand there and do a job, they have character. And then they become friends, which is great too,” he says. “Who doesn’t want a job where they get the hang out with their friends all day?” @Paulherrmnn | @tomorrowisanotherday_agency

"Having collaborated with the likes of Stüssy, Vans and Schott before, Erin Magee’s label MadeMe’s has now teamed up cult female streetwear brand X-girl. Sharing the same values of “tomboy aesthetics and Riot Grrrl ideals,” Magee has often cited the brand and its founder, Sonic Youth’s Kim Gordon, as a continual source of inspiration in her own endeavour to create pieces “for girls, by girls”. To model this ten-piece capsule collection, which consists of reversible puffa jackets and features original Mike Mills artwork, Magee enlisted Kim’s daughter Coco Gordon Moore, who is pictured here shot by photographer Ricky Saiz. It’s actually the first time the Gordons have been involved in any X-girl project since the rights were sold to a Japanese company in 1998. Where the mainline MadeMe collection currently features motifs like an ‘Earth Crisis’ slogan which pays tribute to current affairs, Magee channels her rebellious energy into a collection that is decidedly more optimistic. Rainbow stripes, bright reds and pastel blues – shot through a lo-fi lens – recall the original 90s spirit of the legendary X-girl. Shot by Collier Schorr, Coco Gordon Moore starred on the cover of Dazed’s winter 2015 issue and in its accompanying story, she discusses making art, having Kim Gordon and Thurston Moore as parents and her profound disinterest in fame. “My Instagram is private,” she says. “I’m a pretty private person in general... I’ve seen first-hand what fame can do to a person, and I have no interest in it.” Head here to read more. Stocked at Opening Ceremony and VFiles in the US, the new collection is now available on www.mademenyc.com.

"After releasing some footage taken behind the scenes at the shoot last week, Chanel has debuted its AW16 eyewear campaign starring its newest ambassador Willow Smith. Following in the footsteps of Cara Delevingne who featured in the campaign last season, the 17-year-old star is photographed by Chanel’s creative director Karl Lagerfeld, posing in the brand’s latest eyewear range. “A multifaceted artist, writer-composer-singer and actress, Willow Smith is the embodiment of her generation’s spirit,” reads a statement from the house. While Smith has been wearing Chanel for a number of years, her relationship with the house became more official in March when, after attending its AW16 ready-to-wear show, she became one of its ambassadors – a title held by a small and very select group of Lagerfeld’s muses. However this isn’t Smith’s first foray into fashion – signed to The Society Management in New York and Elite Paris, she also featured in Marc Jacobs’ David Sims-shot AW16 campaign alongside Cher, Kim Gordon and Winona Ryder. Head to the gallery above to see the full campaign, and below to watch its accompanying film.

"Jeremy Scott has had a wild year. Between scaling the heights of classy kitsch as creative director of Moschino and designing Katy Perry's costumes for the most watched Super Bowl performance in history, the Kansas-born, Americana-obsessed designer has scarcely let up to breathe. So how does he do it? We're about to find out. Scott announced on Instagram last night that he has recorded the past year of his life on film for an upcoming documentary. ""EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE THAT I HAVE BEEN FILMING A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT MY LIFE AND WORK OVER THE PAST YEAR WHICH WILL BE RELEASED IN THEATERS LATER THIS YEAR,"" he wrote, posting a picture of himself holding a very directorial-looking clapboard. Further details are thin on the ground, but we do have one confirmed cameo in the documentary – Scott's close friend and muse, CL from 2NE1. In addition to his announcement on Instagram, he posted a behind-the-scenes shot with the K-pop star. So how excited are you for the story of Jeremy Scott? Liked this?

"In celebration of ‘the beauty of living, of reality, of today’, Prada launched its Resort 2020 campaign on Instagram earlier this week. With flowers taking the staring role, the Italian house intended to explore the precariousness of the every day. Starring an array of models who each pose with a bunch of flowers, the bouquets are wrapped up in bespoke Prada paper, featuring images from previous campaigns, including black and white portraits shot by American photographer Drew Vickers and street style-like images by Keizo Kitajima. Now, Prada has employed some of its favourites to star in the campaign in their home cities. Captured alongside the likes of skater and model Blondey McCoy and @museummammy, aka Dazed 100-er Kimberly Drew, fashion icon Grace Coddington is also on the line-up. Seen smelling a bouquet of flowers, her face half-immersed in the fashion paper, the former American Vogue creative director is captured outside a flower shop in New York. But it's not just Coddington and McCoy that are able to get in on the floral Prada action: a number of florists around the world are wrapping their bouquets in the label's bespoke paper in celebration of the release of the new campaign. Pick one up in Milan, New York, Shanghai, London, Moscow, Paris, and Tokyo. Take a look at the campaign above and Prada’s SS20 show below.

"Converse has released a new campaign for its latest shoe, the classic Pro Leather, which has been re-introduced to the American brand’s line up. Joining the Chuck Taylor as one of the label’s most recognisable and iconic trainers, the shoe is inspired by retired American basketball player Julius Erving, AKA Dr J, and his influential style in the basketball community. Initially released as a basketball shoe, the simple structured silhouette has been given a contemporary update. Coming in both high and low tops, the shoe will first be released in the classic white and red on October 24. Also coming in blue, yellow, and black, these colours will be available in early 2020. Featuring the likes of model Paloma Elsesser, her brother skater Sage Elsesser, basketball player Kelly Oubre Jr and more, the campaign reflects on the style of Dr J. Playing in the 70s, Erving popularised the shoe at a time when athletes were having an increasingly influential impact on the fashion world. “I evolved into leading the class style-wise,” Erving said in a statement. “The Pro Leather was a change from the canvas. There were some experimental shoes before it, but this became the one to compete in. The look was off-the-chain. It was a work of art. At the time, it represented an evolution of Converse basketball … Although it was simple in its design, there was a lot of tech in the shoe. I am honoured that people related to it. I am honoured it continues to live on.”

"Earlier this year, Converse released its ‘Spark Progress’ project, celebrated young female talents. Among the five creatives, was longtime collaborator of the brand and Royal College of Art graduate Feng Chen Wang. For her latest partnership with the American footwear brand, Wang has returned, joined by contemporary French labels Koché and Faith Connexion. With the aim of reimagining Converse’s DNA, through the filter of sport and utility, each designer created their own capsules – available online now – featuring clothing, shoes, and accessories. Faith Connexion’s collection embraces a sense of elegant utilitarian fashion, featuring and leopard/camo print mash-up on sportswear clothing. While still being inspired by Converse’s outdoor heritage, t-shirts with street art show the collection to remain true to the Parisian label’s celebration of fashion, art and street culture, within youth communities. “Faith Connexion is a community, it's a tribe, it's something that happened when we started this and it just pulled in energies of all different types,” says creative lead Maria Buccellati. “From street artists to designers to music people, we join all of this together and find something special about it that we can share with the world and mix into a fashion brand that is unique and is speaking a language.” Elsewhere, French designer Christelle Kocher – founder of label Koché – used her sports-couture approach to design the collection. Her use of constructed patchwork mixed with Koché’s interpretation of femininity, shown by the hints of lace detailing, adds a playful energy to classic Converse pieces. “I like it to be sophisticated but with comfort, with a strong attitude,” Kocher explains of the collection. “I want girls to feel empowered.” For her first womenswear collection, Feng Chen Wang designed pieces around a red and pink colour palette. Heavily influenced by basketball culture, her collection includes 70s windbreaker style jackets, along with her version of the iconic Chuck Taylors. The words ‘Girl Power’ appear throughout her collection, from sneakers to jerseys. Head over to Dazed’s Instagram account to learn from Koché how to fuse streetwear with high fashion and how to build a creative community from Faith Connexion as part of our Life Lessons series. Converse Reimagined is available now.

"We all know by now that fashion can be pretty terrible for the planet and people on it – but not everyone is resigned to this as an unchanging fact of life. Stella McCartney’s commitment to ethical and sustainable practices is well-documented – she famously turned down a job at Gucci because she wouldn’t work with leather, and refused to sell her fragrances in China because of demands around animal testing. Founded back in 2001, her company is a testament to the fact that being fashionable doesn’t have to cost the earth (or any animals their lives). First launching a vegan-friendly fragrance and starting to power all her UK stores with wind and other renewable energies way back in 2003, McCartney has watched as the rest of the industry has become more aware of the impact it has – with brands as huge as Versace, Tom Ford, and Armani all joining the cause to go fur free. Her own groundbreaking moments include when she worked with biotechnology company Bolt Threads on the Mylo Falabella Prototype 1, a handbag constructed of an alternative to leather made from mycelium – the root structure of a mushroom. Yes, really. This commitment to innovation is woven through every inch of her new flagship retail space on London’s Bond Street, which, through its construction, pushes her vision to new heights. From crystals buried under-foot for good energy, to fur-free-fur lined elevators recycled from seasons bygone; from a papier-mâché wall made from her office’s waste-paper, it’s Stella McCartney’s ethos, plus her aesthetic, from floor to ceiling. It also, FYI, has the cleanest air in London. The designer tells us more about the relocation, how to be a sustainable brand, and why choosing the environment is so important in fashion. Why do you think so few brands commit to sustainability? Stella McCartney: I think there are many reasons for brands not to commit to sustainability in the way that I do. I think my core belief system is about how you live your life and how you reflect that in everything that you do, whether it be fashion or food or travel. Everything that I do is a commitment to sustainability and to being responsible and ethical. I don’t eat animals, so why would I kill them for fashion? I think that very few people start coming into a room with that starting point, so that conversation doesn’t always come about. But I think that it’s also incredibly difficult to be sustainable in fashion. It’s the second most harmful industry in the world to the environment, and there’s a reason for that. There’s a reason that, up until now, it’s continued being incredibly harmful because that’s all that people know, and there’s a lot of money to be made in that way. I’m here to question it, I’m here to challenge it. Is the challenge of being a sustainable brand exciting, too? Stella McCartney: It’s one of the only punk rock things that’s really happening in the industry now; to actually stop and say ‘No, this isn’t acceptable, and we need to work together as a team, as a collective to make change’. And to actually create policies that benefit and encourage people to be better in practice and better in business. You have to commit, you have to believe in it and you have to care, and the problem is most people don’t care. Do you think the only way to be truly modern is to be sustainable? Stella McCartney: For me the future is technology, it’s also that the youth of today won’t stand for a lack of transparency and they won’t stand for the incredible destructiveness of the fashion industry. They’re going to demand more mindfulness, more sustainability and more ethics. If you want a business and you want to connect to a young customer – which it seems is what everyone wants to do – you have to do it in a way that responds to their needs. The fashion industry cannot ignore that, and needs to deliver more for this new and future customer on every level. “I don’t eat animals, so why would I kill them for fashion?” – Stella McCartney So much about fashion is at odds with sustainability, how have you carried your ethos into the building of an entirely new space? Stella McCartney: Sustainability is a massive part of the store. We have purposefully made an effort to use more handmade, organic and sustainably sourced elements in the store design. It’s the cleanest air in London, thanks to the breakthrough filtering technology of Airlabs that removes 95% of the air pollutants and harmful gases. We brought nature into the space with all the trees and moss and even a bespoke internal rockery, which for me is just so exciting. We’re using reclaimed timber in some furniture and even the fur-free-fur from my previous collection has been re-purposed for the interior of the lift. We also have pieces from other stores that we’ve brought into this store; like the ceramics made of all natural ingredients. The actual collections are obviously incredibly mindful and sustainable, there’s no dead animals in there which obviously is the most sustainable, kind and ethical thing that we do as a house. How did you ensure that the look of the store would translate across seasons? Stella McCartney: The idea of seasonality is really interesting in this store because we have nature, we have life – we’re working with mosses and stones and trees, therefore you’re going to feel and see the seasons. There’s an outdoor garden in the courtyard upstairs; we could have done anything up there, but for me to be able to have a garden inside a building in Bond Street, just feels so luxurious. What do you want people to feel when they enter the space? Stella McCartney: We’ve got so many different emotional experiences. I want to engage with people who may not (usually) come into the store and don’t even know who Stella McCartney is, as well as of course take care of our loyal clients. I want the people that come to Stella McCartney to feel special because they are special to me. How are you planning to make people feel special? Stella McCartney: So we have the ‘Members and Non-Members Only’ club which you are invited into via a code on your mobile phone. It is a really personal and curated space – it will allow customers to connect with me and the brand in a more intimate way. We will have a different experience each time like showing the inspirational journey that I go through with my team every season when we have to create a new collection. The customer will be able to see what it is like to be in my studio with me, creating that collection.

"It’s that time of year again – where the world’s biggest retailers attempt to pull our heartstrings all the way into their stores with Christmas campaigns about sad old people, poor but virtuous children and homewrecking penguins. Oh, wait, actually not that last one. Today, H&M becomes the latest to throw its hat in the ring with a campaign directed by famed visual perfectionist Wes Anderson. Set on Christmas day, it features a train (the H&M Lines Winter Express) that gets delayed by the snow, following conductor Ralph (Adrien Brody) as he prepares a festive surprise for the travellers. The film, named Come Together, is full of Anderson’s beloved visual quirks – symmetry, retro interiors, uniforms, precisely aligned stationary – and of course features Brody, who has previously starred on a train in The Darjeeling Limited, as well as in Anderson’s other acclaimed films The Grand Budapest Hotel and Fantastic Mr. Fox. “This story may resonate more than ever at a time in the world where we could all do with giving a stranger a hug,” the actor commented of the short. It’s not the first time Anderson has lent his lens to the fashion industry – back in 2013, he directed Castello Cavalcanti for Prada featuring Jason Schwartzman, and returned in 2015 to direct an ad for their fragrance Candy with Roman Coppola. Watch Come Together above.

"What is the meaning of cult? The spring/summer 2019 issue of Dazed dives into the mystery of cult appeal, bringing together the models who’ve set the agenda for cult status for decades, with the new generation of creatives whose work was shaped by them – celebrating ageless inspiration to be found in agenda-setting work. As the first of eight print covers, Alek Wek is shot by Tyler Mitchell, while in a tribute to her hometown and distinctive body of work Mariacarla Boscono is lensed in Rome by Charlotte Wales. A cross-generational collaboration brings together McQueen-muse Debra Shaw, breakout London-designer Mowalola Ogunlesi, and photographer Campbell Addy – Shaw and Ogunlesi also sat down for a unique in-conversation in Paris, discussing visibility for black creatives, and superhero fashion. Elsewhere in the issue, 13 year-old rap star Matt Ox is a sign of changing times for hip hop, Jeff Goldblum wears Prada and reflects on four decades in film, and Claire Denis discusses sex and sin in deep space with Robert Pattinson, who stars in the auteur’s new film, High Life. Cult no-wave pioneer, Lydia Lunch reflects on her storied career as a disruptor of good taste, Charlie Fox curates a chilling guest edit ahead of his upcoming twin gallery shows, and synthwave syren Tamaryn selects LA’s up and coming Darkwave bands. Poet and artist Diamond Stingily responds to an archival piece from Kathy Acker in our literary section, while generations of UK photographers from Martin Parr to Hanna Moon dive into their archives for photos that reflect life in Brexit Britain.

"Hot off the back of their car wash-themed Milan Fashion Week show, Moschino have unveiled the campaign for their new fragrance, starring original supermodel Linda Evangelista. Shot by Steven Meisel, the campaign features Evangelista (the photographer’s long-term muse) posing with the fragrance, which resembles a bottle of glass and surface cleaner Windex. The brand’s SS16 show featured iPhone cases which also took the shape of the Windex bottle – these went on sale and promptly sold out, almost immediately after the show. However this isn’t Evangelista’s first outing for Moschino – the ""We don't wake up for less than $10,000 a day"" supermodel recently starred in the brand’s AW14 campaign, which saw her shot in monochrome (again by Meisel) wearing Jeremy Scott’s McDonalds-inspired collection for the house. Pictures of her taken by the photographer in the 90s also served to inspire the beauty at this season’s show. Known for his Warholian appropriation of everyday imagery, Scott based his SS16 collection for Moschino on car washes and construction sites. The show saw a bevy of the designer’s favourite models – including Bella Hadid, Lexi Boling, Stella Maxwell, Pyper America (sister to Lucky Blue Smith) and Anna Cleveland – take to the catwalk in traffic cone hats and road sign fascinators, luxe road maintenance uniforms and silver work dungarees, along with dresses with car wash bristle fringing. “They are sophisticated and they are in a hurry and they are on a construction site but they’re too rich to be here and all these people are paying attention to them but they need to go!” said Scott backstage at the show, describing his SS16 girl. “The key word was ‘cunty’!” Watch Moschino’s SS16 show below:

"If you’re not following Balenciaga on Instagram, you definitely should be. A never-ending hole of eclectic and seriously likeable images, the brand enlists creatives all over the world to interpret its collections in-between its shows. The latest person to join this is fine art photographer Catherine Opie. Starring in the images are musician Shannon Funchess, and models Caroline Schechtner and Jenny Shimizu. The latter has been previously shot by Opie for a series in 2009, but initially found fame the 90s, walking for the likes of Calvin Klein, Prada, and Jean Paul Gaultier as an openly gay model. Styled by Lotta Volkova, the trio appear in Balenciaga’s Autumn 2018 collection, posing on chairs that are often integral in Opie’s work. Known for her iconic portraits, over the years Opie has taken images of the S&M scene in San Francisco, teenage footballers, bikers, and self-portraits of herself breastfeeding. While the collaboration between Opie and the Parisian house was only for Instagram, we hope there’s an Opie-shot campaign in the works. View the images in the gallery above.

"Natalie Portman stars in the new Miss Dior campaign in a film called It's Miss, Actually. In the ad, shot by celebrated Control director Anton Corbijn, Portman plays a bride-to-be who clearly isn't all that enamoured with the idea of getting hitched in the Cote D'Azur. ""The story is about escaping, about getting away from all the things that tie you down in life,"" Corbijn told Vogue. ""Natalie Portman was fantastic. She is real, she's genuine. You can see it on the screen, and people relate to it. I think that this 'truth' is more important than beauty. Being a beautiful woman is not enough. She's a real person, a good person, and her personality makes the difference."" Portman's character looks over a beautiful balcony at the ceremony below but, despite the picturesque scene, wears worry all over her face. Her father, bedecked in a bowtie waits patiently on the steps below, only to be disappointed by his freedom-seeking daughter. Eventually, unable to go through with the wedding, Portman elects to run away from the altar, throw off her wedding dress and escape in a helicopter, while another man kisses her neck, all to the rousing soundtrack of Janis Joplin's ""Piece Of My Heart"". Portman is no stranger to Dior; she's been a long-running muse of the brand and has previously been shot by Sofia Coppola and Tim Walker. Check it out below: Liked this?

"If John Waters’ biggest fan had an instagram account, it would be that of Crete-born Jonny Seven’s eponymous page @jonny_seven. Essentially, it’s an ode to mundanity, with a side order of the eerie, the gross, and the uncanny thrown in: think flip flops with a picture of feet printed on their soles, a mannequin’s arm hanging from its crotch, jeans that tell onlookers to fuck off, or a lit cigarette burned through a flower. “I try to create an environment where words like fashion, beauty, or romance take on a different meaning to what most people might initially think of,” Seven explains of his feed. “That’s why I often use the hashtags #fashion or #beauty in pictures that aren’t necessarily related to them. It’s a way to redefine those words with a sense of humour and sarcasm.” Much like Waters, Seven takes the things we know so well and depicts them in a strange way. It’s like a tiny noise coming from a huge object. When there’s so many images that aim to please, these make you feel a little uncomfortable – but that’s the point. “Fashion, which is the main theme of my account, is really important to me,” he adds, “it’s like seeing fashion everywhere, from the most beautiful to the most disgusting and disturbing thing.” Seven takes inspiration from midnight movies as well as people on the street: the way they ride the subway, what they are wearing, and how people interact are all example he gives when describing what makes the perfect post. Mundanity is about both specificity and ubiquity rolled into one place – that’s why Ryan Gosling smiling with a doll as if it’s his girlfriend works perfectly for Seven’s grid. You both know it and you don’t – which is what creates that feeling of uneasiness when looking at the pictures. “Usually my followers send me images of weird things they see during their day,” he continues. “I’m really happy that some people relate (to) my instagram account and the environment that I try to create.” He’s also a furry fan, a theme which crops up regularly on his grid and has inspired him to start furry fandom zine Triha (which means human/animal hair in Greek). “I was always attracted by the furry community and I have been a furry myself for one and a half years. The first issue, entitled ‘Dreams are Toys’, is about my main fursona, Bjorn, who is a blue bear. The content is focused on the dreams he sees during hibernation. I took photos and created collages, referencing some of my favourite dream sequences in cinema (Dumbo, Wild Strawberries, Brazil and 8 ½). The first issue will be launched this fall.” @jonny__seven

"We’ve only just finished the SS19 season, but the industry is already gearing up for the AW19 menswear shows in January. Following in the footsteps of Craig Green, Raf Simons, and Gosha Rubchinskiy, Glenn Martens’ Y/Project has been announced as the guest designer at Pitti Uomo’s trade show in Florence. “It was the first city I ever visited without my parents when I was 17,” the designer told Business of Fashion. “Now that I have the opportunity to show there, I want to connect it with the historic background that makes up part of Y/Project’s brand DNA.” While the label presents both womenswear and menswear, it’s the latter that will be the focus – although there will likely be some women’s looks on show too. “Our womenswear has much more followers but the core of each collection is shown during men’s season so Pitti Uomo presents a big platform to put our menswear in the spotlight,” Martens continues. “I hope it’s going to help our growth.” The date of the show is currently unconfirmed but will take place during Pitti’s schedule from January 8-11.

"Although it may feel like we have just gotten over this year’s Met Ball and the looks which made their way down the way pink carpet, the infamous institution has just announced its theme for 2020. As we prepare to enter into a new decade, the Met’s annual fundraising event, or, more accurately, your-chance-to-act-as-a-fashion-critic-for-the-night-event, has revealed the theme for its latest exhibition will be called ‘About Time: Fashion and Duration’. Following on from this year, which took inspiration from Susan Sontag’s Notes on Camp, next years event will look to another literary heavyweight, Virginia Woolf, and her seminal time-travelling novel Orlando. Although we can all agree the Met is about one thing and one thing only, the red carpet looks, there is also an exhibition which takes place too. For 2020 we will see the New York museum showcase a century and a half of fashion history from its extensive archive, presenting it along a disruptive timeline. Wanting to challenge the way we think about fashion history Andrew Bolton, Head Curator of the Met’s Art’s Costume Institute said the show is about “reimagining of fashion history that’s fragmented, discontinuous, and heterogeneous.” Explained in a press release, the exhibition will compare designers from different eras, such as Alaïa‎ and Vionnet, or juxtapose two designers from a certain period who were competitive, such as Rei Kawakubo and Georgina Godley in the 80s. Look back at our BTS Met Ball 2019 pictures below.

"Seven months, four campaigns and one show into his tenure, former Versus Versace designer Anthony Vaccarello is now getting into his stride at Saint Laurent. Today, less than a month after launching its third campaign film featuring Travi$ Scott, the house has dropped its latest offering: #YSL04 – Evening Part 1. Photographed by Collier Schorr (who shot Zayn Malik’s Dazed cover and, for our winter 2016 issue, Stranger Things stars Finn Wolfhard and Millie Bobby Brown), the film depicts a club scene. It stars a group of Vaccarello’s muses, many of whom modelled in the SS17 show – Freja Beha Erichsen, Cara Taylor, Hiandra Martinez, Jourdana Phillips (who walked exclusively), Mileshka, Sasha Kichigina and Selena Forrest. It also stars the show’s only male model, Florida-born photographer David Friend and another guy – British model and musician Josh McLellan. The film actually gives us a clearer picture of what Saint Laurent menswear is going to look like under Vaccarello because, along with the sheer tulle shirt worn by Friend, it features a slim-fitting black suit modelled by McLellan. A foretaste of things to come? As for the soundtrack, it comprises of Erichsen reading a text by Andy Warhol over Beethoven’s Symphony No 7. Watch #YSL04 – Evening Part 1 below:

"For MM6’s SS18 presentation, all tradition was thrown out of the window. Instead of the typical scene where models appeared in the space like statues – not even daring to blink – for the MM6 event the models walked around the fake store on Floral Street and even joined the general public on the street as an invitation to invite anyone and everyone into the brand’s world. If you were to attend you will have also noticed Dazed’s creative director Robbie Spencer live-styling as the even went on. As for the clothes, they were illustrated with scribbles and jottings from MM6 members all the way back in 1998. In addition to the clean and simple silhouettes, there were also two limited edition tees that will be available from the Conduit Street store to commemorate the event and bring together the present and the past. Head to the gallery above for exclusive images from the presentation.

"It's been two years since Prada tapped Wes Anderson to direct the Léa Seydoux-fronted Prada Candy campaign film, but the director's influence has clearly lingered. The Italian house's latest video for its Galleria bag, The Postman Dreams, channels his witty surrealism and comedy – courtesy of LA filmmaker and photographer Autumn de Wilde. De Wilde has created five short films, all revolving around the character of a postman who wouldn't look out of place in The Grand Budapest Hotel. In the first installment, the bored mailman snoozes on the job, caressing the imaginary Prada handbag of his dreams before getting a rude awakening. “I loved the idea of our hero visiting so many different worlds every day and dreaming up fantastic lives for the people her encounters,"" De Wilde told Style.com. ""I have long had a romance with the art of letter writing and collecting vintage stamps, so that and my fixation with uniforms made it all click.” Earlier this year, de Wilde appeared in front of Petra Collins' camera with her daughter Arrow in a film for COS, which shone a light on her career as a female music photographer dominating her hometown. Her love of Hollywood, as captured depicted in Collins’ short, has had an evident effect on her direction of Prada’s five shorts. ""Prada loved my visual take on L.A, so bringing Italy to my hometown of Los Angeles was the idea from the very beginning. What I love about this city is what a bizarre melting pot of obsessions it is,"" she said. You can watch The Postman Dreams below, and head over to Style.com to watch two of the other films in the series.

"Three decades ago, An Vandevorst and Filip Arickx spotted each other on their first day at Antwerp’s world-renowned Royal Academy of Fine Arts: a meeting that would lead to one of fashion’s most distinctive personal and professional collaborations. Hot on the tails of their design heroes the Antwerp Six – the motley crew of Belgian designers who made waves in the late 80s – the pair emerged in 1998 with a bang, establishing their label AF Vandevorst with a pioneering debut show. Inspired in equal parts by Fluxus artist Joseph Beuys and choreographer Pina Bausch, the duo took over the glass-ceilinged courtyard of a school in the Marais and arranged models across 32 vintage hospital beds – recalling, in Vandevorst’s words, “the behaviour of a woman lying on her bed and the integration of that environment into her wardrobe”. Sheets, pillows, blankets, pleats and wrinkles were rendered both clinical and sinister, stamped with their (now signature) red cross, a motif derived from Beuys. It also sparked the duo’s obsession with uniform and its double-edged connotations of safety and tyranny – a tension that filters down to even their more everyday, wearable pieces. To celebrate reaching the milestone of 20 years, AF Vandevorst debuted a retrospective collection during Paris couture week, alongside the launch of a limited edition book – complete with a hand-embroidered red cross on the cover, of course. A few months on, its latest venture is a one-week residency at Selfridges, running from today until the May 6, with book signings, an installation that references their legendary debut show, and the launch of a ten-piece capsule collection in collaboration with super-stylist B Åkerlund inspired by selected pieces from their favourite collections. For many designers, delving into a 20-year archive and selecting their favourite pieces to reinterpret would be an overwhelming prospect. But at a time when many houses are looking back at their previous accomplishments to beat a new path forward (see also: Prada and Versace), AF Vandevorst’s archive meshes so seamlessly with today that not a single piece feels dated – a testament to their clarity of vision and willingness to tell a decades-long story at their own pace. We caught up with Vandevorst and Arickx ahead of their residency to discuss performance, the Belgian design community and where they’re headed next. A lot of your archive pieces still look modern today, was it always your goal to create timeless works of design? AF Vandevorst: We design everything from the heart, our creative process is very emotional. We consider every piece an element of the AF Vandevorst story and every collection like a chapter of our book. In that way you could say, if you like the book, you will also like each chapter! Of course, there are parts in each chapter that are stronger and others that are more soft and less dominant, to keep the balance. During the 40 seasons we only kept the most relevant pieces to us. Apparently, we made the right choice as they are still relevant today. They survived time, and somehow became timeless. You’re known for shows that function more as theatre than a conventional runway. What do you think that format add to the viewer or customer’s experience of the clothes? AF Vandevorst: As narrative is so important in designing our clothes, we apply it to everything we do: from the show, to the showroom, to the store. The story behind it as important as the product that comes out of it. Each presentation gives soul to a collection and we find it essential to pass this beauty on to our audience. We also like to challenge and surprise ourselves by showing our work in an unconventional way, so the book felt like a logic translation and continuation of this and our work, through two-dimensional images. “Our story is very visible in our collections, as it’s so personal. Our work and life are very intertwined, so it feels natural to share it with our audience” – AF Vandevorst You’re very clear with your points of inspiration. Do you think it’s important as designers to be transparent about what inspires you? AF Vandevorst: Every designer should decide this for him or herself. Our story is very visible in our collections, as it’s so personal. Our work and life are very intertwined, so it feels natural to share it with our audience. The book also features quotes from other Antwerp designers, how has the Belgian fashion community shaped your career? AF Vandevorst: Although we are all very different, we do have a lot of respect for each other. Perhaps there’s a certain Northern approach, or it’s the mix of realism and surrealism that connects all of us. This defines Belgian fashion for the outside world. Belgian designers such as Dries (Van Noten), Walter (Van Beirendonck) and Ann (Demeulemeester) definitely paved the way. It was partially because of them we decided to study at the Antwerp Fashion Academy, a school that pulls that creativity out of you, and gives you the opportunity to develop your own personality, to discover who you really are. Why does it feel important for you to remain independent as a business? How do you balance concept and commerce? AF Vandevorst: We do have a business partner but they respect our creativity and let us be who we are, which is an important and reassuring way to work. Commerce is a necessity as it makes it possible to continue the story and to create concepts – and so the balance is secured. You’re obviously master storytellers – what’s the next chapter for you? AF Vandevorst: To co-produce. We love to collaborate with other disciplines to enrich our world, and to be able to tell more and other stories and to share them with people we admire. Where do you see AF Vandevorst in 20 years time? AF Vandevorst: We’re not the kind of people that think way ahead. We like to live in the present and to explore the landscape as it appears. We love and hate the pace of working last-minute, but in a way we always end up there – we like to enjoy and explore every minute and challenge ourselves until the very last breath.

"Taken from the autumn/winter issue of Dazed. You can buy a copy of our latest issue here. You have seen her photo before. Birmingham, last April: Saffiyah Khan, unfazed, hands in her pockets, gazing calmly at the red face of an irate EDL member. The still went viral and, in a big way, the student-activist’s courage was emblazoned across social media. Six months later, Saffiyah Khan is using her platform in creative and subversive ways. After unveiling her photography work for the first time last summer at Birmingham’s Punch Records, she then dabbled in the fashion world, signing to modelling agency Elite and making her runway debut as ""Lady Justice"" in Dilara Findikoglu’s SS18 show during LFW. Seen here in Repossi for Dazed’s autumn/winter 2017 issue, we catch up with the British activist and artist to talk grassroots movements and her powerful enmeshment of art and politics. Punch records in Birmingham exhibited your work as a photographer this summer — you’re behind the lens this time! Can you tell me a bit more about how the show came about and how you got into photography? Saffiyah Khan: The exhibition was a photo documentary of a youth engagement project based around the south Asian music influences, and how young people could couple it with modern sounds to produce a track. I got into photography a couple of years ago after my mum gave me her old DSLR, but I really picked up on it when I got my first film camera. Now I shoot digital because film is sadly just not affordable. You’ve also been modelling here and there and made your fashion week debut in London with Dilara Findikoglu. Is modelling something you want to pursue further? SK: LFW was amazing and it was an honour to walk for Dilara. At the moment, I’m enjoying modelling and I’d like to see where it goes, although I never planned to be doing it!What role do you think art and fashion can play in protest and activism? How can creative projects engage with politics? SK: I see art as a creative medium which needs to exist in politics in order to engage. Political art makes politics accessible to everyone, it asks the audience for their interpretation and opinions — it’s something which is rarely encouraged in politics. It shows that everyone has an opinion on politics and this is important. I also believe politicians need to find more creative ways of reaching out. Looking back at the photo that went viral last April, how did it feel to be catapulted into the limelight so suddenly? SK: It hasn’t been too taxing. Everything has been fun. I’ve been busy! That’s sort of a downside I guess, but I love being busy. For a couple of weeks, it was totally strange to see your face in places where you don’t expect to you see your face. It's been sick to see people out there who are so interested in equality. It wasn’t a self-advertisement that I’ve done any work on since, I’ve been open. I'm active on Instagram and Facebook, I don't have Twitter. I made sure there was kind of a cause there which I now have a platform to think about and show attention to. At least people know it’s a problem that far right groups still exist. Should all protests be peaceful? SK: I think it would be nice if protests were peaceful… The problem is anti-racist protests are a response to racists. And their ideology is inherently violent. They have their opinions and we should respect them… Yes to a degree that if you believe in working people out of their home because the colour of their skin. I think you need to respond however they’re playing it to you. Obviously responding peacefully is a goal. Always. I don’t respect anyone who goes out looking for a fight. But at the end of the day, fascist groups, racist groups, islamophobic groups have become physical, so you have to be physical back. Who inspires you? SK: I never really pick out names for the specific people that stand out to me. Obviously there’s the big political names, people that bring about change. But people who inspire me is people in their communities who are part of grassroots projects. They are working and never get any credit because they almost speak to a problem that is faceless. For example, people who care for homeless people. That shouldn’t be their job but no one credits them anywhere near enough. Homeless people are facing a problem they shouldn’t have to. People don’t get recognition and again it’s for that reason that I can’t really name. What hopes do you have for 2018? SK: I think I’m going to be modelling because I find that really fun. I’ll definitely still be doing photography. I’m channeling my energy into my portfolio trying to be very self critical about it. Nail that down. Photography hopefully will continue improving. And Politics definitely as well, I’ve always been involved with politics.

"Natacha Ramsay-Levi was chosen as the newest creative director of Chloé in March last year after getting her start at Balenciaga (under Nicolas Ghesquière) and then following the designer to Louis Vuitton, where she worked as his right-hand woman. For her debut show for SS18, she struck the perfect balance between adhering to and innovating upon the label’s tradition. In February, the designer returned to Paris to present a 70s-inspired AW18 collection, which now has an accompanying campaign in the form of a dreamy film. The designer’s second collaboration with acclaimed photographer Steven Meisel – who also worked on Chloé’s SS18 – the new film’s longshots pan over an industrial pier on the bank of New York City’s East River, soundtracked by Empress Of’s track “Everything Is You”. There, the Chloé sisterhood – including Rianne van Rompaey, Liu Wen, and Dazed’s spring cover star, Kris Grikaite – shift between a series of vignettes, cycling (sometimes literally) between perches on stone steps and a runway-style concrete slab in sharp, wide-collared ensembles and dresses embellished with metal hardware. Following the success of her first two collections for Chloé, Ramsay-Levi will present her third in Paris this September. Watch the campaign film below:

"The Fawcett Society has said that the charity's controversial ""This is what a feminist looks like"" t-shirts are made in entirely ethically, refuting claims by the Mail on Sunday that the garment was manufactured in ""sweatshop conditions"". ""We are pleased to confirm that we have today seen expansive and current evidence from Whistles that the CMT factory in Mauritius they used to produce our ‘This is what a feminist looks like’ T-shirt conforms to ethical standards,"" said Eva Neitzert, deputy chief executive of the women's rights charity. The t-shirts were designed by Elle magazine and sold by Whistles, with all proceeds going to the Fawcett Society. Deputy PM Nick Clegg, Labour leader Ed Miliband and deputy leader Harriet Harman have been pictured in the shirt. Actors like Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Benedict Cumberbatch and Tom Hiddleston were also photographed by Elle in the garment. Whistles launched an urgent inquiry after the Mail on Sunday investigation revealed that migrant workers were paid 62p an hour to make the £45 t-shirts at the CMT factory in Mauritius. According to the Fawcett Society, the high street retailer has since produced ""expansive and current evidence"" which ""categorically refutes"" the claim that the factory is a sweatshop. Neitzert said: ""We have been particularly pleased to receive evidence that 100% of workers are paid above the government-mandated minimum wage and all workers are paid according to their skills and years of service. The standard working week is 45 hours, and workers are compensated (at a higher rate of pay) for any overtime worked."" The workers are also allowed to join a union and there is a strong union presence in the factory. The Fawcett Society also stressed that an audit in October 2014 by an independent not-for-profit organisation also did not reveal any concerns about the working conditions, welfare or health and safety of the factory employees. In short, this isn't a sweatshop at all. Maya Forstater, a researcher who blogs on sustainable development, says that CMT certainly doesn't look like the ""fly-by-night back-alley operation"" implied by the Mail. ""This looks like a well equipped, purpose built factory,"" she writes. ""As the NGO Labour Behind the Label has said the conditions are industry standard. I’d go further and say it looks like one of the world’s better apparel factories."" She adds: ""Low wages and communal dorms may be an unpalatable contrast to the t-shirt’s empowerment message, inflated pricetag, and celebrity endorsement, but the reality is that work on this unglamorous side of the fashion industry has been a way out of poverty for many millions of women and men, and a first rung towards industrial development for many countries."" Still, that doesn't quite negate the uneasy feeling you get when you consider the existence of a £45 t-shirt made for less than a pound per hour. (It's called late-stage capitalist guilt.) But if we're going to get worked up over the existence of sweatshops, the least we can do is make sure we know what one actually looks like.

"This afternoon London Fashion Week Men’s draws to a close. The last four days of shows have been a testament to the talent of our city’s designers – there was Craig Green’s “anonymous travellers”, Martine Rose’s “American Psycho-style bankers” and J.W.Anderson’s “idea of getting lost in the womb of fashion.” These three designers – like many of London’s fashion talents – were supported in the early stages of their career by Lulu Kennedy’s scheme Fashion East. Fresh off the back of their most recent showcase on Saturday, Kennedy and her team have opened a space in legendary department store Selfridges which will be selling goods by Fashion East alumni – past and present – for the next three months. Like a semi-permanent pop-up, the store boasts collections and one-off pieces by the likes of Kim Jones (artistic director of Louis Vuitton’s men’s ready-to-wear), Charles Jeffrey, Craig Green and many others besides. “We've got a really nice mix of old and new people, which I think is great,” says Lulu. “From Art School and Rottingdean Bazaar who showed two days ago, and Caitlin Price, Matty Bovan, Mimi Wade and Richard Malone who showed with us in September, to some really old timers like Husam El Odeh, the jeweller, who showed with us in 2002.” “Ryan Lo is doing a phone case, Gareth Pugh is doing some music with Matthew Stone and I got Louise Gray to do all the visuals and art direct how it looks in the store,” she continues. “Oh my god, and we’ve done Ashley Williams and Claire Barrow art prints!” When it comes to sharing her favourite item on sale, it becomes apparent that Kennedy is not just an avid supporter of these designers, but an active customer of theirs too. “I've already got the Kim Jones archive t-shirt (I got him to reproduce them from like a million years ago at Fashion East) and the Art School earrings,” she says. “And I’m getting a new Christopher Shannon phone case and the Matty Bovan dress. Rottingdean Bazaar have got mad badges coming in, so I’ll probably get some of them too. It’s all just looking very, very yummy.” Other items include a zine titled Boys in Pain by Charles Jeffrey, a pouch wallet by Craig Green, a chiffon top by Marques’Almeida and a t-shirt by Simone Rocha, along with iPhone covers by Christopher Shannon, Mimi and Per Götesson – and much, much more. Addditionally, several designers – including Martine Rose – will have their SS17 collections stocked inside the space. The Fashion East store at Selfridges is open from January 9–March 31, 2017.

"Since it first launched last year, the rag & bone Photo Project has stayed true to its intention “to create an innovative approach to seasonal fashion campaigns,” featuring a different woman who embodies the spirit of the brand each season. Joining the likes of Binx Walton before her, this time, the visuals star The Girl On The Train actress, Haley Bennett, shot here by prolific fashion photographer, Glen Luchford. Continuing his work for the project, the esteemed photographer turned his lens on the actress who has been steadily building her CV since debuting in 2007’s Music & Lyrics with Drew Barrymore. Her recent turn as Megan Hipwell, the girl who goes missing in the adaptation of bestselling thriller, The Girl On The Train has set the tone of her more mature projects since – including her upcoming role in Thank You for Your Service, a film about war-induced PTSD set to be released later this year. Bringing the same dedication to the set that day, rag & bone CEO Marcus Wainwright commented, “Haley was exceptional to work with – she brought an incredible creative energy, style and perseverance...she danced until her feet were swollen.” Pictured in dynamic poses against a simple white background, the focus is on the “Quality Guaranteed” nature of the New York label’s SS17 collection, brought to life by Bennett’s dynamic energy. For her, “the spirit of this rag & bone collaboration was all about movement and fluidity. Being comfortable in your skin and the clothes you’re wearing.” Directing these movements was specially-brought-in choreographer, Stephen Galloway, who Bennett described working with as “an incredible treat.” Improvising with an overriding sense of spontaneity, the actress said “the shoot took on a life of its own,” acknowledging that “Glen had the very difficult task of capturing that.” But, as per the seasoned pro, he managed this “beautifully,” creating a series of images with a fluidity of a film sequence.

"2018 isn’t even here yet, and already we have something to look forward to. The iconic activist and designer Dame Vivienne Westwood is set to get her first feature-length documentary in March next year. The new film directed by Lorna Tucker – entitled Westwood: Punk, Icon, Activist – will debut at Sundance, and include interviews with her friends, family, and collaborators. Westwood rose to prominence in the 70s, dressing the Sex Pistols and being at the forefront of the punk scene thanks to her and Malcolm McLaren’s boutique SEX. The designer continued to grow her brand through the 80s and 90s and designs today alongside partner Andreas Kronthaler. They presented a circus-themed SS18 collection earlier this year. Of course, in addition to design, Westwood is also known for her activism. Over the years, she has stripped off for a shower campaign with PETA as well as creating an Ethical Fashion Africa campaign, which saw her taking to the streets of Nairobi aiming to empower female workers. Also announced today is a new t-shirt designed by Westwood for War Child UK, which campaigns to suspend arms sales to Saudi Arabia. Although there is little revealed about the documentary right now, one moment we hope will be featured is when she turned up to Buckingham Palace for her OBE without any underwear on. You can’t get any more punk than that. Westwood: Punk, Icon, Activist will be released in UK cinemas on March 23 2018. In the meantime, revisit the SS18 show below:

"In Brazil, the recent election and popular support of President-elect Jair Bolsonaro has prompted protests in the country against racist, sexist, and homophobic comments he’s previously made. While fashion is not always seen as a viable form of political protest, São Paulo-based underground label Estileras’s main objective has been to question what is seen as the norm since it was founded two years ago. “Fashion might have become one of the tools of enforcing the status quo, but in the end it tells us more about the system than anything else,” founding duo Ricardo Boni and Brendon Xavier tell us. “Then you can challenge it.” Both self-taught, they quickly realised after meeting at a party that neither of them were interested in the local fashion scene, or any other more traditional forms of fashion. “For us, getting dressed was only possible because of thrift shops,” they explain. “That’s how we first got into the reusing and recycling side of fashion.” “We want to create a new scene that opens people’s eyes to the fact that clothing is just fabric – not gender, sexuality, or political views” – Estileras From there, the two honed an aesthetic, creating looks out of recycled garments stitched or safety pinned together. Elsewhere, hand-scrawled illustrations appear on jackets and tops. The standout though, is what they call ‘Monster Shoes’ – a Frankenstein-like mash-up of different styles of shoes, cut and spliced together to create a monstrous platform. Ugly sneakers, before ugly sneakers were even a thing. “What the fuck is a trend anyway?” the pair retort at any suggestion of a link to mainstream fashion. Continuing to do things their own way, the label has amassed a larger creative community – an Estileras family. “We collaborate with so many amazing artists from different fields and we’re all connected,” the duo says. This community often appears in the label’s images, a mix of different backgrounds, body types, sexualities and gender identities. “We don’t fit into fashion and we don’t want to,” they continue. “We want to create a new scene that opens people’s eyes to the fact that clothing is just fabric – not gender, sexuality, or political views – even if it’s mostly expressed otherwise.” While the election of Bolsonaro is one that the pair disagree with – “disgust and anger” are how they describe their feelings towards him – they are far from defeated. “Fear was already a constant living here,” they conclude. “But now it has become the fuel for revolutionary acts.” Here, we speak with the duo about the political unrest in Brazil, the Estileras community, and continually doing things their own way. How did you first get into design? Estileras: We had doubts about going to fashion school, but our lives eventually led us to other places that recognised fashion as an important role in art expression. Nightlife is all about looks and our scene in particular was all about freaks, so clothing was not a parameter to judge as much as it was to display your ideas. How did you first start the label? Estileras: We met at a party and we became aware that we were the only ones in our scene that were ripping clothes and repurposing pieces in different ways to their original forms. We had the idea to do an editorial that showed off a small collection of jeans we made. We upcycled them and shot the pieces on some of the most badass people in Brazil like Linn da Quebrada, Jup do Bairro, Slim Soledad, Luna Georgia and Ah Teodora. What is the local fashion scene like? Estileras: There are lots of scenes and groups that have their own unique style in São Paulo, but those who work directly with fashion are the same European/American spin-offs, trying to sell beauty as a burden. Clothing is not seen as art by anyone, or a medium that is worthy of having many layers of concepts. Our specific scene has many different ideas and styles – we like the ugly, the weird, and it’s the way we live so we have a strong connection to the idea. We want to work in and occupy spaces in fashion and art through our connection to weirdness. We never wanted to be part of the traditional fashion scene in Brazil, to be role models. How would you describe the label? Estileras: We make a mockery of fabric. We created our style to communicate a dialogue with people, companies, galleries, etc. We remake clothes, create images, videos, performances, parties, and art. Now that we have our own studio, we want to invite people to collaborate with and help rethink the boring usual with us. What did you want the label to represent for others? Estileras: In Brazil we would say: ‘A moda quem faz são vocês’ (fashion is who you are). We don’t want people to give a flying fuck about the industry rules – live your tastes through whatever fabrics, textures, colours, and in any way you want. We want to appeal to people who don’t live in reality, like us. Why is upcycling such an integral part of the label? Estileras: There is already so much clothing in circulation, so we need to be more careful with all the waste we’re creating. It’s already bad enough that the arts, music, fashion, politics etc are a reference of a reference – we live in a cycle. We need to be more conscious of everything that surrounds us. We affirm the system that obligates us to work, spend, and waste forever and we need to try and stop that. “We don’t want people to give a flying fuck about the industry rules. We want to appeal to people who don’t live in reality, like us” – Estileras How do you think Brazil’s artistic community will be affected by recent political changes? Estileras: It’s hard to know for certain because Bolsonaro’s party tactics are to deceive and spread fake news. The new narrative is that artists have a plan to sink the country into an era of communism – it seems impossible, but lots of people believe it. He also has plans to end the Ministry of Culture and recently addressed the nation with the most violent words, encouraging people to arm themselves against people who are a supposed communist threat. It’s the beginning of a witch hunt, but at the same time we have some amazing representatives in Congress who can help turn things around. It’ll be a hard battle though. What advice would you give to people who might be scared by the changes? Estileras: Be aware and try to connect with others who share the same feelings as you. Don’t waste your time arguing – especially if you’re not in a safe space for discussion. It’s also good to remember that fear often leads to exaggeration in the news, which creates more fear. Most importantly, be open to having dialogue with those who need support. How do you plan on growing the label? Estileras: We’re about to launch our website with some new and exclusive images. We have some collections coming up, ‘runway shows’, performances, zines etc. We just want to keep working and criticising everything that is constantly shoved down our throats. We will keep supporting our scene and forming a network with many professionals to help us in many different areas. There is so much life outside the internet and we need to find a way to turn this political nightmare into a potent revolution. @estileras

"This is Fashion Weak, a five-part salacious/spiritual/sometimes sad series of essays about how a former unconvincingly closeted musical theatre major managed to get past the VIP New York City “fashion world” ropes, making a trainwreck of an entrance. The paparazzi are not waiting for me as I exit the Mercer Hotel post-ugly cry. Shame, because it’d be a Daily Mail picture perfection documentation of a tragic “What does he even do?” celeb, if, you know, I was famous. I’m not looking so cute, so I guess it’s a good thing my RSVP for that night’s Katy Perry-hosted Met Gala after-party at the Boom Boom Room was denied. I hate black tie events, anyway. And people. People scare me. I’m rocking a so me cat-fur-covered-from-head-to-toe look: adidas track pants, a Champion (or, “SO Vetements!” – as a socialite recently vocal fried...ugh!) baseball hat paired with a Spice Girls reunion circa 2007 tour t-shirt. My most prized fashion-forward possession is under an equally as spicy dud – a bomber I was gifted the morning prior, when I was stable/happy-ish wrapping up a press trip in Mexico City. On the back of the bomber, it reads MEXICO IS THE SHIT in gold lamé. This punk-ass piece was a bit Lost In Translation in CDMX – my farewell-amazing-city selfie was photobombed by a local’s middle finger. Anyway, the terrifying paps are unravelling because Kendall and Kylie Jenner are in town for the Met Gala and are staying at the luxe hotel. I learned this from Courtney Love, who’s also in town for the Met – she and Frances Bean will be Marc Jacobs’ dates – because I’ve just left her room where we Buddhist chanted for over an hour. “Nam-myoho-renge-kyo! Nam-myoho-renge-kyo!” we chant with another Buddhist on a puffy couch and with roaring lioness-in-heat vibrations. It’s all about the vibrations and, as a trio, ours are kind of like a triple layered guttural Hole chorus. We’re in this harmonious thing together. “New Year’s Resolution: Get your shit together. Get tested. Don’t die. Etc. Maybe the severe nostril popper burns were what woke me the fuck up on January 1, 2015” Chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is meant to be “like the roar of a lion,” said Nichiren Daishonin, a 13th-century Buddhist monk who insisted that chanting NMRK (and portions of the Lotus Sutra) would provide wondrous soul-soothing benefits – tapping into every human’s inherent Buddha nature, transforming sufferings into happiness, accomplishing one’s human revolution, changing one’s destiny and fulfilling dreams in the present and the future. These are teachings which members of Buddhist lay organisation, the monk-less Soka Gakkai (translation: Value-Creating Society) International, follow to obtain peace, love and happiness. To be BFF with the universe! There’s no high like a Buddhist high. I would know! (And there’s no comedown. Well, except for that first Monday of May you’re currently reading about.) In other words, Courtney Love basically summoned my hibernating spirit. And with perfect timing! I’ve hit many a rock bottom, though the ringing in 2015 by smooching an Ezra Miller-y-looking indie rocker when the clock struck midnight in an embarrassing Brooklyn music venue’s bathroom while his girlfriend wondered where he was rocked my world in a catastrophic natural disaster kind of way. Yet I survived, as always. It was pretty fucking bad though. Also pretty bad/sad was when a Pitchfork/David Lynch/fashion world favourite (and whom some – not me! – have called a wannabe Courtney Love) accused all of us of stealing her pills from her thrift purse in the green room. I was never a pillhead, I shakily shouted, before Uber ghosting and zipping over the Williamsburg bridge to my second home: a grimy gay bathhouse, where amphetamine-sharing bottoms were perpetually aplenty. AAAAH!!! ‘Twas the final cocaine straw! New Year’s Resolution: Get your shit together. Get tested. Don’t die. Etc. Maybe the severe nostril popper burns were what woke me the fuck up on January 1, 2015. They hurt! They were ugly! I couldn’t do this shit anymore. This wasn’t me. I was, Courtney iconic album title reference, Pretty On The Inside, dammit. I would not be a victim of my mental disorder(s) and delusions! I’d soon learn that chanting is all about wiping off your spiritual cocaine-smudged Ikea mirror, and seeing yourself how you want to be seen. The true you. Chanting/praying for your inherent Buddhahood to emerge. (“Buddha” means “Enlightened One,” which, for me, translates to just being your best, non-messy, victorious slaying self.) Let’s rewind: I met and interviewed Courtney back in 2013 at a Coachella after-party at the Parker Palm Springs’ luxe Gene Autry Residence (basically a fat ass house hidden amidst a secret garden) where she was staying, and where I think I remembered her ordering a $1000 caviar quiche to her room. I was also meant to stay at the pimped-out pad, but I was sort of kicked out by association with a problematic publicist (not by the lovely Love – long story). Anyway, we developed a mostly industry-related on-and-off text relationship, and I’d go on to interview her several times. About a week following that New Year’s Eve/morning rock-bottom, and like a true compulsive Bipolar, I emailed Courtney’s publicist and nabbed a comped ticket to a Courtney-starring experimental-ish rock-pop musical theatre piece. I needed some healthy self-medication/inspiration, AKA a distraction from the fuckery flickering like a tweaking-out strobe light in my defective brain. Also, any excuse to get out of bed. It was gonna be quite the experience! This wasn’t an arena rock show with a mosh-pitting audience – it took place in a 60 people black-box theatre, where a lot of minor keys and cello playing happened. I went alone. I like being alone when I’m sad. But Courtney’s uber-vulnerable performance resuscitated my soul, which resulted in me texting her a bit after to congratulate her on being so amazing, so damn fearless – I was beer brave, gulping post-show Stellas with a friend/fellow mentally ill sexual compulsive at Metropolitan, a gay beard-heavy hangout in Williamsburg. “It’s all from chanting man!” she texted re: all of her recent successes, including an upcoming guest-starring role on Empire. I didn’t know what the fuck she was talking about. I responded: “Oh wow! I wish I could chant. I can’t even do yoga!!” “I’ll teach you! Come over at 10 tomorrow morning.” “Ok cool… do I wear sweats or something?” “JUST COME!” Fuck me with a yoga block in child’s pose. I am terrified. I assume it’ll be some Hollywood intimidating shit, miserable wealthy skeletons cross-legged on Persian rugs whilst chain-smoking. It’s not like I was starstruck or anything – but why would a rock ‘n’ roll icon want to help little tragic me? Maybe Courtney sensed my darkness via my penchant for the side-eyeing moon emoji. Empathy is probably important in Buddhism, I thought. JUST COME! “Why would a rock ‘n’ roll icon want to help little tragic me? Maybe Courtney sensed my darkness via my penchant for the side-eyeing moon emoji.” A bathrobe-clad Courtney greeted shaky ass me at the door of her West Village townhouse with a Marlboro Lights kiss on the lips. (She’s since quit.) I was blushing and sweating, so I removed my American Apparel hoodie. She then plopped onto the floor on a Persian rug surrounded by construction paper and coloured pencils where she’d get back to sketching self-portraits. She doesn’t look up when she barks “Alex is a mess!” to Genie, who appears to be zenned out on an antique chair in front of Courtney’s Buddhist altar – there’s burning incense, a couple prayer beads and a singing bowl. I love those things. Also, an enshrined scroll of sorts with a bunch of Chinese Sanskrit characters all over it. I carefully tiptoe toward Genie, through Courtney’s maze of designer pumps. Genie’s angel energy chills me out. She tells me in yoga voice that the scroll is called the Gohonzon. It’s “the object of devotion” and, as SGI’s prayer book describes, the “embodiment of the Law of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, expressing the life-state of Buddhahood, which all people inherently possess.” Oh, ok! (Just Google it.) While Courtney goes the effective tough love route (“Help him!!!”), Genie is the soul sis type – she’s obviously a Pisces (Courtney is not down with Astrology) who teaches yoga to children and, like Courtney, boasts the kindest of hypnotic heaven blue eyes. And really good glowy skin. It’s that enlightened glow that got me. Sign me the fuck up! My editors were ignoring me that week, which was a blessing in disguise, because I then was available to chant with Courtney twice a day, morning and night, for hours, and for what felt like a Buddhist boot camp of a week. (In between, we binge-watched season two of The Comeback, proving Courtney has immaculate taste.) Giving chanting a chance was crazy because I used to hate the vomitous universe chatter. Like, REALLY HATE. Soul rot would commence as soon as the It Girl of the month hyper-blabbered about karma and the planets or what-irritating-ever in the bathroom of a dishevelled-hipster haunt, the Beatrice Inn (RIP), so I’d quickly scoop up and feed her cocaine key bumps to shut her the fuck up. An Olsen was always waiting in line and I didn’t want to be rude! But I was so desperate to cease feeling so doomed. I’d try anything, so long as it was free or comped by my Medicaid. I wouldn’t say I’m now enlightened or anything – that’s so dramatic – but, ever since miraculously joining SGI in early 2015, I’m better than ever. And I’ve tried it all. Really. My most recent shrink told me to “picture a lamp in your heart,” so I quit. I still see a psychiatrist, though, who recently upped my Wellbutrin and Lamictal another 100 MG when I begged to go holistic. He’s a great listener. There’s also that one week in an LGBTQ-only rehab – refer to my previous essay. I’m so done with AstrologyZone.com every other week, and fuck right off Reiki – the “healer” told me I was “spiritually a mess” followed by spritzing my face with lavender essential oil before offering me a “very reasonable for NYC” packaged payment plan. Off to 15th Street’s SGI culture centre, I went. Chanting is always there for me, and it doesn’t cost a thing. It deducts your misery bit by Buddhist bit. You should be jealous of my soul’s credit score. Or, as we practising SGI Buddhists call it, my life condition. Unlike my freelance schedule, the twice-a-day chanting gives me a healthy, and even an inspiring routine. For example, I’ll convince myself that my Mercer Hotel breakdown was a karma-clearing breakthrough. Because it’s totally okay to cry for absolutely no reason! I’ll turn “poison into medicine” (this is very big in SGI)! I’ll slay my fundamental darkness and joyfully jump out of bed and chug a cold brew pre-morning chanting and look up to my colourful inspiration wall above my desk, with a quote from Courtney on a hot pink post-it that reads: “Just create value every day. When you inspire people, you create value.” And a neon yellow post-it with Genie’s cute advice to tell the unhappy thoughts that’ll inevitably arise in an attempt to ruin my happy: “Cancel, Cancel!” I’ll metaphorically Windex the shit out of my Gohonzon, my spiritual mirror. And I’ll see myself how I wanna be seen. The Windex is the Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, and with it, I’ll polish my life condition, fulfil my present and future dreams, and cancel, cancel the “You’re so fucking crazy” mess I’ve heard from many an asshole (and from myself) for so long. I can finally see my true self! Because everything you need is inside of you, that is, if I’m listening to the teachings. Depends on the day. The aforementioned good vibes is me on a good day when I’m really dedicated to taking care of my spiritual hygiene. Commitment, passion, an actual attention-span, optimism, a zest for life – they’re fleeting. Definitely not listed on my resume. In other words, I’m not the most active of Buddhists in my organisation. Chanting is not a madness cure-all for me. It’s like highly concentrated vitamins. But Bipolar II disorder is a condition that can’t be cured. That’s just a fact. The masochistic compulsive behaviour, the cameo clouds of depression, feeling inadequate and the crushing guilt over being so sad in an already sad enough world. It’s all there, along with the “What’s the point of even waking up?” I’m very aware that all of this is in the shadows, waiting to pounce on my stability when I least expect it, when I finally feel worthy of being happy. So, I nervously wrote these essays. To reflect, to research and to I guess understand why I’m like this. To laugh at the absurdity, to remind myself that, though it doesn’t feel like it, I’m not alone. According to a Google search, there’s 200 classified types of mental motherfucking disorders! It’s sad and annoying that so many of us are accustomed to putting on a rehearsed smile and/or isolating underneath cigarette-burnt sheets... because we don’t want the world to see our ugly. Unless you’re Lana Del Rey, it’s not cute to be a Debbie Downer. Many with mental disorders aren’t even here anymore. The worst is finding out this kind of news via social media, which tends to result in me stalking the dead’s memorialised Facebook account, combing through the “she was full of light!” and “rest easy” comments. Where the fuck were you when they needed you the most? Well, to be honest, you probably didn’t know. They would never allow that. In their defence, they were protecting you and keeping you away from their internal hell. I get it. I also get how I’m coming across to some readers: you might be hate-reading this because you’ve heard this all before. Or you really cannot relate. Lucky! So many of us are “sick”, so many of us get puke-y with those who tweet about “suffering from mental illness” and who write mental-health-related think-pieces. Same! Wow, another delusional, mediocre writer who’s branding him/herself/they as a mess? So lovable. Another privileged narcissist details his/her/their unremarkable rehab stint and learns nothing? Groundbreaking. If he hates his career so much, why doesn’t he just quit? He’s not made for New York. He’s not Bipolar, he’s just an attention whore! Stop right there. I own it. I get it. I am trying to get it. Still trying. So I will choose to push through the pain and panic because I know that I’ll be stable and, gasp, even happy hopefully soon-ish. I power pumped through the paparazzi as I made my Mercer Hotel exit with Genie. They were disappointed that we were not the Jenners. But we didn’t care. They were just doing their jobs, and I was just trying to get it together, which is basically my full-time job. In my Buddhist practice, we’re taught that we are all the same, anyway. The Jenners, the psych ward patients, and Courtney Love, who some might see as a salacious celebrity, but who I see as my Buddhist sponsor. I never needed to be on the front-page of The Daily Mail to show me who I am not. I just needed some tough love to remind me of who I am and who I can be. I’m not my illness. I’m also not great at writing Lifetime-y happy endings. I’ve got self-diagnosed PTSD from all of the years of faking it. Instead, I’ll just write my own headline. I’ll even put it on a post-it. Affirmation: I’M PRETTY ON THE INSIDE. That’s good enough for me.

"There’s a lot of reasons we want to go back in time right now – to escape the current political climate, to turn back the clock on our actual climate, and, of course, to bring back the killer looks. Since its inception in 2015, Italian label Corelate has taken inspiration from contemporary culture, so it makes sense that its latest collection draws on our present nostalgia for previous decades. Inspired by the shapes, colours, and textures of the 80s, the collection harmoniously merges modern streetwear with the bold eccentricity of the past. Shot in London, the lookbook sees models leisurely browsing the sunny market in bright scarves and smart shirts, casually snapped by shadowed figures, before presumably rushing off for a creative business meeting. Corelate’s designer Maurizio Tedeschi draws on both the functional formality of 80s power dressers, as well as the unconventional aesthetic of the punks for AW18. The pairing of street codes, including hooded jackets and bucket hats, with workwear items, such as collared shirts and briefcases, returns us effortlessly back to the present day. The collection adds a twist to the traditional, from jersey sweatshirts with raw-cut bottoms, and smart wool coats reinterpreted with coloured patchwork, to tailored trousers in a variety of materials. For the first time in its winter collection, Corelate has introduced new shoes, offering their take on the bright and incredibly comfortable ‘dad’ sneakers we’re still so obsessed with. Our blue sky market days might be over for now, but Corelate’s AW18 collection will keep you warm and looking sharp until the sun manages to claw its way back out. Corelate’s AW18 collection is available now.

It was upon becoming bored with her personal account – and “uploading pictures of myself and following friends and friends of friends whose pictures I didn’t even like” – that Entenza started the @sinneroconnor Instagram as a way to visually express herself, while following accounts that inspired her: specifically those that illustrate a ‘precise and charismatic world’. “@sinneroconnor is all based on my personal taste, so I’d say it’s a rather bizarre artistic account,” she explains, “But the content has to be authentic – faithful to my interests, while being artistic, meaningful and underpinned by cultural history.” When it comes to the things that interest Entenza the most, it’s movements from the past, the birth of new cultures, alternative ways of thinking, and the way in which they have changed, developed and influenced current culture as we know it. Specifically, “the creation of the punk movement”, “the development of surrealism in various artistic mediums” and “the creation – and use of psychedelic drugs – and how they have influenced many artistic and political movements”. Scroll through @sinneroconnor’s feed and you’ll find stills from films like Greg Araki’s Doom Generation, Léos Carax’s Tokyo!, and Gaspar Noé’s Enter the Void, alongside tears from iconic goth zine Propaganda, photographs of Studio 54's 'Disco Granny', and newspaper cuttings chronicling the skinhead era. There’s fashion too, from Walter Van Beirendonck’s Wild and Lethal Trash show, to Alexander McQueen’s AW01 What a Merry-Go-Round collection, while art makes an appearance in the shape of performance pieces by Marina Abramovic and Yael Davids, works by Kieth Haring, and everything in between. As for the name, Entenza is a huge fan of Sinead O'Connor. “At the time of making the account, everybody was talking about Sinead O'Connor because of her polemics. She had tried to kill herself and she was talking shit about her kids, so I decided to create a word play on her name.” Meanwhile, the bio for the account reads “sin is life, life is sin” – which alludes to Entenza’s belief that us mere mortals live in a cycle of sin. As Entenza explains, “Human beings are not yet ready to become superior beings, so our lives – and ourselves – are all based on sinning and being a sinner.” @sinneroconnor

"In just three short seasons, Katie Hillier and Luella Bartley – who were previously at the helm of Marc by Marc Jacobs before it shuttered – have carved out a niche for grown-up whimsy, creating looks that, most importantly, they would want to wear. “The motivation comes from my personal identity crisis and confusion with growing up into middle age womanhood,” explained one half of the duo, Luella Bartley. For the SS18 collection – that was inspired by Sarah Lucas (whose images dominated the moodboard) – this is no different, with playful elements like animal prints, bunny handbags and fishnet tight material layered over tailoring making up the looks. “We got particularly interested in the symbolism of fabrics this season, the weight of a man’s Savile Row suit and the strange femininity of hosiery,” said Bartley. “So the inspiration came from that and the idea of using both extremes together.” The result produced masculine silhouette suits in striking gold or lilac, and camel coats with tufts of fur appearing out of the collar. For the campaign – photographed by David Sims, with art direction from Dazed’s Jamie Andrew Reid – the idea was to capture the “perversity, playfulness and innocence of it all,” according to Bartley. The accompanying video – with animation and sound by Eddie Whelan – is equally fun. Instead of the typical steely fashion gaze, the model appears looking inquisitively or confused into the ether. “As I said it evolves with our personal preoccupation with femininity and identity and character, the age-old question of womanhood and style and what it means and why we care,” mused Bartley on the future of the brand. Wherever it goes next, there is no doubt that having fun will be the main objective. Watch the campaign film below:

"Naomi Campbell is back – not that she really went anywhere – tonight sashaying down the catwalk at Off-White’s SS18 show. Fresh from her appearance at Donatella Versace’s SS18 tribute to brother Gianni – where she appeared alongside fellow supermodels Cindy Crawford, Claudia Schiffer, Carla Bruni and Helena Christensen – this time Campbell walked in a show that was a tribute to the late Princess Diana. Closing the show (and rightfully so) the entire room gasped (also rightfully so) when she stepped out onto the red carpet runway. She didn’t even finish her lap before people started clapping and cheering her on. Dressed in an all-white look that consisted of an asymmetric blazer with cycling shorts, she wore plastic-wrapped shoes from the new Off-White x Jimmy Choo collaboration. A more elevated collection for designer Virgil Abloh, he wanted to express how Diana was his current muse. “Off-White has always been about the modern woman, the empowered woman, the businesswoman and I wanted that show to be influenced by her presence,” he explained backstage. And while there were overt references – like the skirt suits and patterned tea dress – the soundtrack was also inspired by The People’s Princess. “That score was made up of birds and native animals that were from the area she was born,” Abloh explained. While the Paris shows continue and we pray for another appearance from Campbell, we are desperately trying to figure out a way to look that good in spandex… Head to the gallery above for backstage images from the show.

"Earlier this year, Paco Rabanne released its first fragrance collection under the direction of Julien Dossena. Named Pacollection, the range of six perfumes explores the personal nature of scent through unique character archetypes: Fabulous Me, Genius Me, Dangerous Me, Erotic Me, Strong Me and Crazy Me, all contained in unusually squishy metallic bottles. “They all have a freedom about them,” Dossena told Dazed Beauty. To celebrate the new range, we invited a group of free-spirited talents – Maxim Magnus, Sasha Trautvein, Fenn O’Meally, Brent Faiyaz, Chen Xue and Rhea Dillon – on a shoot with Dexter Lander to explore the ‘Fabulous’, ‘Genius’, ‘Dangerous, ‘Erotic’, ‘Strong’ and ‘Crazy’ sides to their personalities. Styled by Gary David Moore in Paco Rabanne AW19 (we definitely have our eye on musician Brent Faiyaz’ red snake-print jacket and model Chen Xue’s gold slip-dress), each was also asked to play Dazed’s version of ice-breaking party game ‘Never Have I Ever’ using the metallic Pacollection perfume bottles as props. During the shoot we learned that model and presenter Fenn O’Meally has been skinny dipping and been caught cheating – “at least at family games night”, she added, and that Faiyaz has kissed a stranger but never managed to kick a bad habit. Relatable. With the ‘Never Have I Ever’ videos up on our Instagram stories today, (here!), and you can take a look at the full set of images in the gallery above.

"Have you unintentionally bought into Ivanka Trump’s clothing line? Potentially, after it emerged that G-III, the company who owns the rights to the eponymous brand, has been replacing labels with new tags bearing the name ‘Adrienne Vittadini Studio’ – a pre-existing American clothing company. According to Business of Fashion, who uncovered the apparent switch, the newly labelled clothes were shipped to Florida outlet chain Stein Mart where they were then being sold to unsuspecting customers. The discovery comes after alleged weak sales (following retailers like Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus dropping the brand), and a boycott initiated by Grab Your Wallet against Trump-owned or affiliated companies. The campaign distributed letters that could be sent to apply pressure to retailers to discontinue stocking items. Apparently, one Stein Mart customer took protesting into their own hands – spitting on an Ivanka-labelled blouse in disgust. Despite a seemingly universal shunning, in a statement to BoF, a representative for G-III maintains “the Ivanka Trump brand continues to grow and remains very strong.” Whether it was a mistake or an intentional profit-driven deception is still unknown, but the organisation claims that neither Ivanka nor anybody else at the company was aware of the change. (WYS Adrienne Vittadini?) With sales figures for the first quarter of 2017 to be published shortly, we can only hazard a guess as to why G-III may have wanted to play down associations with Trump.

"In a collaboration that re-imagines the “ultimate pop culture sneaker” Nike Air Force 1, streetwear giants Nike and Berlin-based label Acronym explore the motion of athletes putting on and removing shoes to create an all new design. “Acronym is about autonomy. It's freedom to experiment and having a platform for ideas that we want to pursue,” explains the brand’s lead and Nike collaborator Errolson Hugh. Updating the putting it on/taking it off process and improving functionality was the most important element for him, with the collection drawing inspiration from military and industrial gear, as well as sportswear. Skipping the mood boards and roughing up a design, the team took an engineer-like approach to improve technicality, particularly with the introduction of a zipper. “Technicality in fashion is something that, when we began Acronym years ago, was a completely foreign idea,” muses Hugh. “Nobody was really pursuing that or understood the need for it. At least not on a practical physical level. There were plenty of things that 'looked technical', but nothing that we thought really worked.” Acronym are of a lucky few to have the opportunity to toy with the sneaker’s design and, admittedly, although Hugh was aware of the shoe’s impact on pop culture, he’d never worn one himself. “The advantage of that turned out to be that we could proceed in a radical way, because it wasn't a sacred object to us. If it would have been a shoe that I'd grown up with, or was wearing every day for the last 20 years of my life, I would probably have been afraid to do some of the things that we did,” he says, adding, “If you don't bring your ‘A’ game and deliver, you'll never live it down.” In celebration of the collaboration, Dazed teamed up with London-based filmmaker Rollo Jackson to explore underground movements in a dystopian city, watch it here. The NikeLab Lunar Force 1 x Acronym® will be available September 17 at nike.com/nikelab and in select global retailers

"Founded in 2013, the LVMH Prize was created to honour and support young designers around the world. Following 4000 applications of 102 different nationalities, today’s finale – held at the Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris – announced Japanese brand Doublet as the grand prize winner and awarded South Korean born designer Rokh with its special prize. Presented by Jaden Smith and Emma Stone, the fifth edition of the coveted prize was judged by the likes of JW Anderson, Maria Grazia Chiuri, Nicolas Ghesquière, Marc Jacobs, Karl Lagerfeld, Humberto Leon and Carol Lim. Each of the nine finalists, including A-COLD-WALL*’s Samuel Ross, Charles Jeffrey, Eckhaus Latta and Dazed 100-er, Ludovic De Saint Sernin, competed for one year’s worth of mentorship with LVMH experts. Masayuki Ino, Doublet’s founder and creative director, took home the top prize of $300,000 as well as a year’s mentorship. Doublet follows in the footsteps of last year’s winner Marine Serre, who has quickly established herself as a force to be reckoned with on the Paris scene following her 2017 victory. Additionally, Rok Hwang (of label Rokh) will receive $150,000 to build his London-based fashion brand. Soon after his nomination, the young designer told Dazed “I don’t think there will be any chance for me but I’m very happy I came this far and I’m grateful for everything, any exposure and attention.” Clearly, he's been proved wrong, and with the backing of LVMH, it's certain that this pair of young designers are about to make a big mark on the industry – a huge congratulations to them both.

"If you aren’t familiar with Pitti Uomo, it’s the little brother to Milan Men’s Fashion Week and takes place in Florence. Held bi-annually, most of the attendees opt for three-piece suits, but with guest designers invited seasonally, it also brings the fashion pack with it. That much was apparent to observers – including our faithful documenter Yu Fujiwara, who recently photographed attendees on the streets during the AW18 show season. “Despite the recent genderless movement, Pitti Uomo feels very macho in a way, but at the same time with a ‘boys will be boys’ sort of charming-ness as well,” he says. Fujiwara – always withdrawn from any sort of spectacle – gave no time to potential Pitti peacocks, instead capturing the true essence of the event and going beyond the main venue to capture the city itself. What did he find? Alongside some dapper gentlemen and those with a love of streetwear, some local authority officials. Oh – and plenty of curious locals too.

"Since hip-hop became a thing, its biggest names have been obsessed with Ralph Lauren. Among those who have name-dropped the all-American brand over the years are Kanye West, Nas and Wiz Khalifa. There are also superfans like New York’s Lo Lifes gang, who were so smitten with the 90s garms that they would shoplift them. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of one of its iconic collections, Ralph Lauren is bringing back its Stadium line. The archive collection was unfortunately unavailable after its season but is now back – and better than ever. In addition to the original pieces – that have been re-released for you to be able to invest in a piece of cultural history – the new collection will also feature reworked pieces to bring it into 2017. Inspired by American athletes from the 20s and 30s, Stadium was released in 1992 as a celebration of the Summer Olympics and became an unofficial uniform of sorts. The twelve-piece offering features the bold graphics and vintage-looking typography that make the sportswear items so covetable – many of them have been in high demand since its 1992 release. Standout items from the new collection, include a reworked coat with a drawstring waist and internal cuff detailing, a red windbreaker and a track jacket with red and white stripes highlighting its cut. Launching tomorrow, the collection will be available from Polo stores and in limited supply at a pop-up at Selfridges on Edward Mews. We are not are condoning shoplifting though, even if you are a wannabe Lo Lifes member. The Limited Edition Polo Stadium Collection will be available in global Polo Ralph Lauren flagship stores and select retail partners from September 21.

"Among the endless Instagram accounts paying homage to the heady days of the 1970s – and a sea of girls with Farrah Fawcett-locks, in denim hot pants and floral, ruffled-sleeve blouses – lives @rewindbeauties, an account with a unique point of view. Started by Mica, a London-based creative writer and curator – who was frustrated at the lack of representation of people of colour on the aforementioned 70s accounts – @rewindbeauties is on a mission to better represent the era, while sharing thoughts on intersectionality. Growing up, Mica found herself fascinated by the photographers, counterculture and political movements of the 70s, along with old-school Volkswagens and a pair of platform shoes (or two) – all of which feature on her account. Expect archive clothing adverts, vintage cars, nostalgic interiors, images of musicians, poignant political press imagery and riotous moments from history aplenty. Highlights include images of protesters at a “Feminists Against Racism” rally in Tallahassee, Florida in 1977, feminist graffiti on a 1979 Fiat advertisement in London, and work by Jamaican photographers Neil Kenlock and Rose Murray that sit among a host of other politically-charged images that document global history. Here, Mica tells us more about her account. How would you describe your account? @rewindbeauties: As an archive of beautiful people, places and things. There are many layers to it, but to put it simply I’d say ‘intersectional nostalgia’. What made you start @rewindbeauties? @rewindbeauties: I was frustrated at the lack of representation on accounts that focused on the 60s and 70s. I think the fashion and movements are fascinating, but not everyone was blonde or from the US, so I began to explore imagery that noted black people and communities of colour. I’ve always collected images; as a child I’d make collages by cutting things out from magazines and leaflets. As I got older, I began to do more research and use old photos for art inspiration. It wasn’t just the subject that interested me, but the photographers and the politics, the counterculture and the revolutionary movements of the era too. So I combined my new found photographs amongst platform shoes, Volkswagens and images of Woodstock, and began posting under @rewindbeauties. What’s your main mission? @rewindbeauties: To share relatable imagery and have a platform for women to see fabulous clothes, learn about the baddest babes and exchange ideas. The aim is to make intersectionality mainstream. The term was coined by Kimberlé Crenshaw in 1989, noting how our experience of oppression differed – even intensified – when we take into account the overlapping layers of our identity: gender and race, as well as class and sexual orientation. I don’t think it’s something people should be in awe of. I have never been a woman without being black, so I find the concept fairly simple. What’s the criteria for a @rewindbeauties post? @rewindbeauties: I try to make sure the images are good quality and not something I’ve seen often. I also have an obvious rule – no fascists or bigots, no matter how much of a babe they look. Relevant is also great – even if the image is from 1966, if it can relate to current affairs then it’s a keeper! “I also have an obvious rule – no fascists or bigots, no matter how much of a babe they look” – @rewindbeauties You’re starting a shop soon... @rewindbeauties: I’ve been sourcing stock for Rewind Beauties for nearly a year and I’ll be selling vintage clothes and reworked pieces I’ve embroidered amongst other things. I’ve also had the opportunity to connect with photographers and artists, so I’m looking forward to collaborating with them. I’d also like women and girls from across the world to be able to sell their artwork to an audience in the same headspace. What do your references reveal about you? @rewindbeauties: Probably that I like colour and fashion, and I know representation is important. I’m sure it reveals that I am very political – images are a form of activism, too. Who are your favourite artists? @rewindbeauties: Guan Milan was a game-changer and I find Fauvism fascinating. Jurell Cayetano and Chris Ofili are so different, but they both use colour like magic! Judith Baca is also an activist, she has a lovely eye – her work is so important. But Frida Kahlo hands down is The Babe. My GCSE art teacher showed me her work and I’ve been obsessed with her symbolism and fearlessness ever since. And photographers? @rewindbeauties: So many! Graciela Iturbide, Danny Lyon and Jamel Shabazz. I love Jack Garofalo, Jennie Baptiste and Malick Sidibé. I think Gordon Parks has a phenomenal way of telling stories. Who do you count as the most inspiring women? @rewindbeauties: Susan Sontag was a great writer and activist – her essays in 1966, “Against Interpretation”, were ahead of her time. Angela Davis because she is non-stop. I grew up hearing stories about her, and last year I attended a talk of hers at the Southbank Centre. She had the whole audience absorbed. Pam Grier – I loved her style and the roles she played in film. Grier is the main reason I became so interested in Blaxploitation. Andre Lourde was an amazing activist! Her writing and poetry are a 10. She actually died the year I was born, but I've learnt so much from her words. One thing in particular that she noted was, “Caring for myself is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation, and that is an act of political warfare.” Self care is so important for everyone, but I think it's a beautiful reminder to activists. Has anything unexpected come from your account? @rewindbeauties: Most definitely – so many stories and loads of amazing energy! Additional context has been given to images and I’ve connected with women around the world who understand the importance of intersectionality. We are learning and unlearning all the time. So much solidarity. From times when there’s been natural disasters as well as acts of terrorism to messages of support for the migrants in Calais. When my brother died, I had followers send truly beautiful messages. It’s still unbelievably hard, but people that I’d never met sharing their truth and sending support was unreal. I’m really grateful for that. Who do you love to follow on Instagram? @rewindbeauties: @4frontproject, @themakingsofmama, @the70z, @reclaimyourpower, @seventiees, and @thebazaarbohemian.

"If SS14 saw the Proenza Schouler boys conjure tough rose-gold breastplates and sinuous metallic dresses, their AW14 collection is all hot colours, distorted Pollock prints and sculptural silhouettes. Little wonder that their new Marie Chaix-styled campaign strives to capture that same electric sunset glow, setting into motion the energy, action, and color explored on the runway. In this exclusive image (above), photographer David Sims catches Netherlands-born rising star Julia Bergshoeff (DNA) in the middle of shooting a sideways glance, the viewfinder's perspective tipping to catch her eyes. Maybe it's suggesting we're all tilting at windmills to enter Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez's world – but to be honest, theirs is the kind of slant we'd like to have on life. In an April interview with Dazed, Hernandez explains the process behind their perspective-altering collections: ""I don’t know how to explain, just that we don’t overthink it. We’re like, ‘Oh, I need a colour for this thing,’ and a car goes by with a great colour on it and we’re like, ‘Oh, that’s a great colour.’ Just like that, we’re picking up information from living, and it feels contemporary somehow."" Take a look at the rest of the campaign below; read our AW14 show report of the collection here or check out our backstage images in the gallery above.

"While Jefferson Hack and Rankin were busy sewing the seeds that would eventually become Dazed & Confused in London, across the Atlantic, Marvin Scott Jarrett was coming up with the concept for a magazine that changed the face of American culture. Established in 1992 out of a tiny, one-bedroomed apartment in Malibu, Los Angeles, Ray Gun quickly became a powerhouse of music and style – as the likes of Missy Elliott, Sonic Youth, and David Bowie graced its covers, and Henry Rollins, Björk, and Iggy Pop filled its pages. With a lifelong predilection for the eclectic music coming out of the UK and a deep love for British publications including NME and The Face, Jarrett founded the magazine with the intention of creating a radical, uncompromising publication for kids across America with whom Rolling Stone just didn’t resonate. Throughout the course of the 90s, Jarrett is credited with bringing the likes of British bands Inspiral Carpets, Blur, and Jarvis Cocker to a passionate new audience of US music fans, and introducing them to the work of European creatives including Corinne Day and Wolfgang Tillmans. Much like the contents inside the magazine, the design and aesthetic approach of Ray Gun was pretty innovative, too. Led by art director David Carson, pages were printed back to front and upside down, leaving people wondering whether the move was intentional or not. “Ray Gun didn’t set out to be radical or disrupt anything. We were just doing our own thing, and I think because it was authentic it ended up making a lot of noise” – Marvin Scott Jarrett The articles themselves often went in some unique directions, too – just take the time an (apparently slightly dull) interview with Bryan Ferry ended up being published in symbol-based font Dingbats, rendering it illegible, for example. “My executive editor freaked out when it came back from the printer,” laughs Jarrett. “For me, it was in the spirit of punk rock and roll. Visually it was awesome and, somehow, it worked.” (Sadly there’s no mention of how Ferry himself reacted when he saw it). In January 2000, just eight years after it started, Ray Gun was over, with Jarrett shutting the cult magazine down to focus on other projects (including Nylon, which he founded in 1999). Now, almost 20 years later, its legacy is celebrated in the form of a new book, Ray Gun: The Bible of Music & Style, which compiles the best covers, fashion shoots, and interviews in one place, with contributions from the likes of former cover stars Liz Phair and Flaming Lips’ Wayne Coyne. Here, we talk to Jarrett about Ray Gun’s earliest days, his best memories of working on the magazine, and whether or not he’d consider bringing it back in 2019 (or beyond). “We started it as three people in my dining room in a one bedroom LA apartment. It was me, executive editor Randy Bookasta, and my partner Jacqueline, and David (Carson) would do the art direction from San Diego. First of all, we had to think about it from a higher, conceptual level – the idea was to make a music magazine that had really cool design and production values, inspired by the alternative scene that was happening in the 90s that wasn’t so well documented in the US. But we didn’t set out to be radical or disrupt anything, that sort of just happened. We were just doing our own thing and I think because it was authentic it ended up making a lot of noise, which was fantastic. It resonated with a lot of people around the world.” “Of course – it set the tone for everything that was to come. When we’d got the visual style, which was the genesis for the big idea, we started thinking about and putting content together for issue one, thinking about who best represented the title. Henry Rollins was really interesting to me because not only was he this alternative punk guy, he was all about his poetry and had his own publishing company, which I thought was really cool. Sonic Youth were the quintessential, archetypical, post-punk noise band from that time, so obviously they were in, it just made sense. And we got Spike Jonze to shoot them, actually, which was great.” “I grew up listening to British music:, and was inspired by Bowie to start playing my own music actually. And then I put my love of playing music together with my love of magazines and started making music magazines. At one point, I lived between London and Los Angeles, working on Ray Gun LA and an MTV magazine called Blah Blah Blah from a little office in Old Street long before it was cool. But I’d always been in touch with that side of the world. I used to buy NME, which was like my bible, and I wanted to bring what I loved about that scene to more people. One of the best things about making a magazine is turning people onto different music and new cool things they might not have otherwise heard about. Eventually, I worked a lot with British graphic designers across five titles and they ended up being some of the greatest issues. Being between the UK and the US was inspiring and amazing – it gave me more of a global outlook on things.” “I was really influenced by the style of The Face, it was one of the main reasons I wanted to make magazines, and obviously fashion was a huge part of that. We called Ray Gun ‘the bible of music and style’ because I really wanted it to have that fashion element. It could never just be music, because music and fashion are so interlinked and related, and in the early 90s you were seeing that crossover more and more. We had some amazing people shoot for us: Corinne Day contributed to every issue, Wolfgang Tillmans shot style stories and a couple of covers. We gave them a lot of freedom to experiment.” “I love them all! But probably one that stands out is the 30th issue with David Bowie. He inspired me so much that the magazine’s name was taken from his song “Moonage Daydream”, so it was amazing to actually get him for a cover. It was also a significant moment because it signalled the end of the relationship with David Carson, because he turned in a cover I wasn’t happy with and I changed it at the printers. Otherwise, I love the Jesus and Mary Chain cover for some reason, just the little picture of the brand and the typography is really cool. I spent a lot of time delving into this for the book and it never gets easier. Shooting Marilyn Manson was incredible. Even the KISS cover was super cool to work on. We basically set them on fire, since we didn’t have the ability to use computer effects like you can today. Radiohead was an amazing cover too, especially as I’m a big fan.” “People ask me all the time if I’d bring it back, particularly now The Face has been relaunched. I don’t know. Maybe I’ll bring something back, or maybe I’ll bring something new. I have wheels turning in my head right now, and I want to do something, because I’ve got that bug again. I’ve been developing a few different things simultaneously, but we’ll have to see which one comes first – me included.” Ray Gun: The Bible of Music & Style is published by Rizzoli and available to buy now.

"Feng Chen Wang may have graduated from London’s prestigious Royal College of Art (RCA) back in 2015, but for the last few seasons the talented Chinese-born designer has been busy winning over New York’s fashion elite. For her AW19 show she’s returning to the city that schooled her, bringing with her a collection she cryptically says will be inspired by “the idea of connecting bodies together, layering and entwining fabric.” As always, functionality will be key – so don’t expect to see any fake pockets. “I always look to the human form when designing a collection,” she says of her primary inspiration: bodies. Wang has built her reputation on experimenting with silhouettes; she drapes, deconstructs and works fabric into surprising new shapes, offering up her own take on tried-and-tested menswear staples. This theme might be continuous, but Wang has spent the last few months considering her own role in the fashion industry as a female designer. The results are evident in her ongoing partnership with Converse, the latest instalment of which debuted late last year at Shanghai Fashion Week. “I took inspiration from the first women’s basketball team and ‘girl power’, but I was thinking about my role as a female designer too, and the way I grew up. (That) inspired me to bring a sense of reality to my designs.” Not only are the designs slick and functional – think plenty of mesh and jersey in unusual silhouettes – they marry the brand’s reputation as a sportswear favourite with Wang’s own design DNA. The result is a collection built with city life in mind; that also marks the latest chapter of a long creative partnership with Converse, which stretches back to her SS17 collection. “We first started working together then – models wore Converse trainers for the show – and we haven’t stopped. I always say our relationship is kind of like dating; the more we know each other, the more we like each other!” As well as innovative twists on wardrobe staples like hoodies, tees and track jackets, the collection also features Wang’s take on the iconic Chuck Taylor – otherwise known as the shoe that became a cultural phenomenon. Since the original Chuck 70 was released back in – you guessed it – 1970, the blueprint has been reimagined by everyone from Jonathan Anderson to Rei Kawakubo. Her own spin on the classic design offsets the trademark Converse white canvas with leather overlays in a variety of colours. “(These partnerships) open doors for me,” she explains of its creation, “but they’re a challenge too. You really have to understand (the brand’s) history and culture, and figure out how to translate that for today.” The capsule also features a few of her trademark touches. The pops of bright colour bring the same life that acid yellows, neon oranges and watercolour blues bring to her mainline collections, whereas the cut-up leather overlay echoes the flashes of skin usually revealed by slashes in her designs. This has been a signature of Wang’s since an acclaimed debut (shown as part of VFiles’ MADE SS16 collection) collection based on her father’s battle with cancer, a story translated into a beautiful show fronted by models trailing blood bags down the runway. The sombre inspiration was interpreted in an abstract way; shapes echoed the silhouettes of outsized organs, and intricate zipper patterns represented surgical wounds. Naturally, some millennial anxieties also crop up as inspiration. “My SS19 collection ‘My Half’ was about relationships,” she recalls. “(It was) about communication and how that connects people; how your ‘other half’ might actually be yourself.” These musings on connection spawned an artfully deconstructed collection, while the title was most literally represented by a metallic, high-shine top slashed to reveal half of the body. Wang’s return to the London schedule for AW19 makes a lot sense given the extent to which she looked at her own story when working on her reimagination of iconic Converse staples. The capsule may be a sign of things to come; it demonstrates the fusion of classic silhouettes and forward-thinking design marking Wang as one of the most interesting names in menswear right now.

"With May here, it’s time for another Met Ball to take over the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. This year’s theme – Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination – is sponsored by Versace, and hosted by Rihanna, so will obviously be a huge event. In preparation of Monday’s big event, independent specialist Byronesque Vintage’s founders Gill Linton and Justin Westover have set up a hotline to confess your fashion sins to cult designers Rick Owens and Gareth Pugh. When reaching the number, a voice message of both designers reading Depeche Mode’s “Personal Jesus” will play, also accompanied by documentary clips of cult worshipping. “There are a lot of fashion sins committed on the Gala red carpet every year and this year’s theme was literally a gift from God,” Linton explains to us. “We have a personal shopping service, which is a bit like being the priest taking confession for all the deadly sins.” Open from tomorrow, the hotline is your way of anonymously confessing your sins, be that your penchant for fashionable crocs, or thigh-high Uggs. And if that isn’t enough to make you a believer, the Met exhibition will surely have you praising God when it opens. To reach Rick Owens call +1 800 666 2498 and for Gareth Pugh +1 800 666 9524.

"The landscape of London Fashion Week is rapidly changing. Yesterday Scottish designer Jonathan Saunders announced his resignation and the closure of his company and, less than 24 hours later, Canadian designer Thomas Tait has announced that he is quitting the runway. Instead, the designer says that he will be presenting his new collections via one-on-one appointments with press and buyers at Paris Fashion Week. “It’s a small and strategic decision to take the time I feel my work deserves, and to refocus and redevelop how we actually present the clothes,” said Tait in an interview with WWD. “There is so much work that goes into what I do, and it’s very much part of the brand DNA to really develop something that inside and out is extremely well considered,” he went on to say. “So I often feel as if – with a catwalk show – although you have a sort of sensationalised moment, I do tend to leave the experience of the show and feel as if there is so much more we’ve been working on that no one could reasonably pick up on in the moment of the show.” As for whether he’d ever return to the runway, he’s definitely not ruling out the possibility. “I’d be lying if I said I have no vision of returning to the runway; that’s definitely on the map,” he said. “It could be in a couple of seasons, it could be in a couple of years. Who knows? But I want to come back with something that will hopefully exemplify my experience over the last few years showing at London Fashion Week and also be a testament to the time that I am taking now to reassess how people interact with the clothes.” Last season Tait, who was the youngest student ever to complete Central Saint Martins’ MA Fashion course, has received critical acclaim for his signature blend of conceptual couture and hardcore tailoring. Last year he won the LVMH Young Fashion Designer Prize and, just last month, won the Emerging Womenswear Designer at the British Fashion Awards. But Tait isn’t the only designer making this kind of reassessment; yesterday Hunter Original announced that it would be leaving the London Fashion Week schedule and communicating directly with its audience via music festivals and its stores. Is the runway show a tired and outdated concept? Some designers certainly seem to think so. Watch Thomas Tait SS16 below and check out the gallery above for backstage images.

"For its latest Code Coco watches campaign, Chanel takes over the Ritz Paris – once known as Mademoiselle Chanel’s home away from home. After unveiling the collection in the late designer’s apartment at 31 Rue Cambon, models Alice Dellal, Soo Joo Park, Nozomi Iijima and Alma Jodorowsky are captured enjoying the lavish life at the luxurious Parisian location in a new short film. Inspired by the iconic 2.55 bag – which was first created by Coco Chanel in 1955 – the Code Coco watches are something of a jewellery-enthusiast’s dream: proposing the label’s renewed codes, the timepieces feature the 2.55 bag’s clasp and lacquered dials set with brilliant-cut diamonds. Watch the campaign video below, and head to Chanel’s website to find out more.

"Paris Fashion Week is now well underway, with the likes of Rick Owens, Raf Simons, and Virgil Abloh (twice!) all presenting their SS19 collections. Next up, was Pigalle’s Stéphane Ashpool, who decided to take things in a different direction to the traditional show format. Here’s what went down. Pigalle designer Ashpool presented his previous collection in a dance school as a tribute to his mother and close collaborator Doushka, a native Serbian who had stints dancing as a ballerina and performing at the Moulin Rouge. This time, he took things one step further, putting on a musical extravaganza in Salle Pleyel, a 2000-seat concert hall minutes from the Arc de Triomphe. Personally directed by Ashpool, the show moved between music and contemporary dance, offering a fully-rounded insight into Pigalle’s USP. Titled Sound of Paris, the collection was a celebration of the French capital’s dynamic creative scene, featuring the likes of Bonita, Bonnie Banane, Ichon and Muddy Monk – and that was just the music. The show also featured actors, dancers, and an orchestra. For evidence of Ashpool’s genuine love of his hometown, you only had to look around – the auditorium was packed with fans of the label and the community that has evolved around it. Hats off to Larry V, who came out in a feathered fedora and a silver three-piece suit and encouraged the already rowdy audience up on their feet for a singalong moment. Ordering everyone to throw their hands up in the air, it took a long-time professional to really get the crowd going. Larry (who we learn is an icon for a younger generation of Parisians) spent the whole set clutching his briefcase that was also, inexplicably, lit up from the inside – just one of the bonkers moments that made the show a riotous spectacle. Naturally the outfits were also designed by Ashpool, and they offered an intergalactic twist on Pigalle’s codes. While Parisian rapper Ichon delivered a barnstorming set flanked by dancers in sunflower yellow sweatshirts and drop-crotch trousers, it was the guitar-wielding duo Papooz who came out in possibly the best outfits of the night, between them rocking a glittery bomber with a distinct flavour of Bowie and a knee-length maroon silk robe that had an appropriately extraterrestrial rockstar vibe. Beam me up, Stephane. With the night being all about music, it was no surprise that Ashpool teamed up with Beats by Dr Dre to create a special collection of headphones. No matter where you were sitting in venue you will have spotted them. The first pair: glitter-covered in silver and red, to match the Beats logo. The real showstoppers though were the pair that were sprouting a variety of blue feathers. The combination of music and style. As a friend of the label, Ashpool collaborated with the footwear brand to create five custom styles of the Chuck 70 in different colourways. The shoes will be released in a hyper-limited run in conjunction with The Sound of Paris. Where most fashion week seating plans revolve around a rigid hierarchy of power players, Pigalle’s show worked in reverse. The entire auditorium was given up for attendees to seat themselves as they wished, and you were just as likely to be sitting next to a superfan of one of the acts performing as you were a fashion editor. In the same spirit of Virgil Abloh inviting thousands of art students to attend his debut Vuitton show earlier in the day, it was a cheering insight into the future of fashion. As streetwear continues to storm high fashion’s Bastille, it’s time for big brands to open their doors and loosen up. When it’s this much fun, why wouldn’t you?

"After numerous reports throughout the year that Ivanka Trump’s fashion label was suffering from weak sales, she has now announced it will be closing. Following his election as US President, Donald Trump said Ivanka was treated “unfairly” as her label was dropped by multiple retailers, but reports suggested sales were plummeting before the result. According to a representative of the label, the decision to close “has nothing to do with the performance of the brand and is based solely on Ivanka’s decision to remain in Washington indefinitely”. Right. Ivanka said: “I am beyond grateful for the work of our incredible team who has inspired so many women; each other and myself included.” Twitter (obviously) responded to the news, with one user saying that Ivanka is choosing to focus on fascism over fashion. Chelsea Handler tweeted: “Ivanka Trump is shutting down her fashion brand to spend more time not helping reunite families separated by her father.” While the label will no longer be producing clothing, you could still be purchasing it unknowingly as the Business of Fashion discovered earlier this year. G-III – the company that owns the rights to the brand – was switching out its clothing labels to read ‘Adrienne Vittadini Studio’ (a clothing company that already exists) instead.

"Taken from the autumn/winter issue of Dazed. You can buy a copy of our latest issue here. Ahead of the Givenchy show at Paris Fashion Week on Sunday – the first with Clare Waight Keller at the helm as artistic director – provocateur-in-chief Nobuyoshi Araki has taken a dive into the deep, red sea for the autumn/winter issue of Dazed. Celebrating the legacy of Waight Keller's predecessor Riccardo Tisci, Araki captures Nana Komatsu (an actress, recently seen in Martin Scorcese’s Silence) and Emma (a model, who goes without a surname) in the Parisian house’s AW17 collection, which takes the iconic silhouettes from Tisci’s trailblazing 12-year tenure and reimagines them entirely in Givenchy red. It’s the ideas of the Parisian house’s old master, spotlighted by the Japanese photographer’s brand new muses.

"Dazed 100-er and hit star of Pose Indya Moore last night paid homage to lives of all the American trans women who have been murdered this year on the red carpet – through a bespoke pair of earrings. The long gold earrings were decorated with 16 ornate frames, each holding the picture of those who have been killed in the US this year. Moore wore the statement piece to collect a Daily Front Row Cover of the Year award, which they won for their recent cover of Elle. They are the first transgender person to grace the cover of the American magazine, after Hari Nef featured on the cover of Elle UK in 2016. They accepted the award in honour ‘of the truth that the best award and the award we all deserve is to be able to get home safe’ – as they later posted on Instagram. Designed by Areeayl Yoseefaw aka @beadsbyaree, the earrings are a variation on the jewellery maker’s ‘keepsake’ earings. Taking to Instagram, Yoseefaw wrote: “Indya Moore’s jewellery served as an altar… In their hour of celebration, they put their sisters in the forefront. They spoke for those who cannot and became a light for everyone.” “Right now the Supreme Court (is) voting on whether or not trans people can access employment, shelter, and healthcare in the same ways that you all have access,” Moore said in their speech. Often using Instagram to raise awareness of the mistreatment and violence aimed towards the transgender community, they recently posted a screenshot detailing the news of two young black transgender women who were murdered. One, Bailey Reeves, was killed after the earrings were made. In their memory, Moore carried a frame with Reeves’s face in it. Reflecting on the night Moore later wrote: “Just like me these women dare to exhaust their freedom to exist by being visible, however, instead of being celebrated, they were punished for it. An existence that requires bravery is not freedom. A life that requires bravery is not free.”

"Anticipation was running high for John Galliano’s second Artisanal collection for Maison Margiela and naturally, he didn't disappoint. Fuzzy cellophane skirts, unfurled tapestry dresses, embroidered potato sack coats and a bride complete with a shrink-wrapped tentacle train made their way down the runway. But there was also something unexpected on the Couture Fashion Week catwalk – three guys: John Whiles, Roan Louch and Carl Hejm Sandqvist. Like their female counterparts, the models wore dresses – Louch and Sandqvist with rose breastplates made of mirror and enamel, Whiles with a blue turban that match his lipstick. Louch has in fact modelled for Margiela before – in the house's resort lookbook – but for the other two, it was their debut. It's not the first time haute couture models have strayed from the gender binary path. Trans trailblazer Andreja (then Andrej) Pejić and drag queen Conchita Wurst have both walked in Jean Paul Gaultier’s couture show (for SS11 and AW14 respectively). This show is another example of the fashion industry's rising favour for gender fluidity. Stay tuned for a full report of Maison Margiela Artisanal AW15.

"Red carpet dressing is in a weird place in 2018. The year began with the Golden Globes, with the women who attended wearing black in support of the #TimesUp movement, formed in the wake of the Weinstein scandal. As well as taking aim at Hollywood’s culture of sexism and sexual abuse, the parade of dark dresses was also a protest aimed at the gendered and vicious double standard of the red carpet: men wear suits, while women in elaborate gowns have their achievements sidelined so their looks can be pitted against one another. The response to the efficacy of an all-black protest was mixed (why not boycott the ceremony all together?) and by the time the Oscars rolled around in March, the red carpet was pretty much back on its best-dressed-worst-dressed bullshit. Yesterday, it was announced that 100 top actresses and female figures in film would stage a protest on the red carpet at the Cannes Film Festival, which opens today, in support of #MeToo. This news got lost in the noise coming from another red carpet, however, considering the fact that yesterday was also the Met Gala. The annual ball accompanies the opening of the Costume Institute’s exhibition, with guests invited to dress to the show’s theme – this year it was Heavenly Bodies, an exploration of Catholicism in fashion. Stars turned out in their best saintly looks – Katy Perry wore some obnoxiously oversized angel wings, Lana Del Rey channelled the Virgin Mary, and Rihanna was a sexy pope in custom Margiela by John Galliano. Before you get in my mentions, let me say this: I love seeing people express themselves through ridiculous OTT couture. I’m also fully aware that there are limitations to using the red carpet as a space for resistance. But considering fashion’s own #MeToo scandal and the fact the theme was, you know, Catholicism, this year’s Met Gala was a missed opportunity for protest. Bar Lena Waithe, who showed up in a floor-trailing rainbow pride cape as a nod to the Catholic Church’s problematic history of LGBTQ+ issues (the Vatican has called being gay a ‘moral disorder’, FYI), and the warrior-esque Joan of Arc looks worn by Shailene Woodley, Zendaya, and Michelle Williams, there weren’t a whole lot of statements anywhere. So why didn’t fashion have its own #TimesUp red carpet moment? Firstly, there are practical considerations, like not pissing off Anna Wintour and risking never being invited back, and the fact that, for the most part, guests are invited and dressed by a particular brand, which limits the scope for political statements somewhat. If your ticket is being paid for by H&M, they might not be so thrilled if you go as a giant billboard for the Repeal Movement, which seeks to revoke Ireland’s strict (Catholic!) law on abortion in the referendum on May 25. The #TimesUp protest of the Globes was a very direct response to the film industry’s sexual assault revelations. Meanwhile, fashion’s reckoning didn’t really even get started. Rumours circulated for months about a New York Times piece about allegedly abusive photographers. Despite naming Mario Testino and Bruce Weber, when it eventually materialised, it was nowhere near as extensive as expected. Then, the Boston Globe’s Jenn Abelson and Sacha Pfeiffer (who was on the team which won a Pulitzer for uncovering, wait for it, the widespread cover-up of sexual abuse by the Catholic Church) detailed more allegations – Patrick Demarchelier was named, but ‘25 others’ were not. An extensive list of names accused of misconduct was published by the Instagram account @shitmodelmgmt, and within a few days was taken down. “Our #MeToo moment was a long time coming, but never quite got the same momentum as that of other industries – it already feels like a memory” Unlike in the film industry, which saw carefully penned and generally very lacking apologies issued by everyone from Louis C.K. to Kevin Spacey, fashion figures have avoided accepting responsibility. Guess Jeans founder Paul Marciano rebuffed Kate Upton’s allegations (corroborated by a third party) that he groped her, calling her claims “preposterous”. Facing a lawsuit, Bruce Weber said he “unequivocally denies” any charges, a position also taken by stylist Karl Templer, who was named by the Globe, as well as Testino’s lawyers. Demarchelier dismissed claims as “ridiculous”. “If you don’t want your pants pulled about, don’t become a model! Join a nunnery,” Karl Lagerfeld said in a recent interview with Numéro. An unfortunate reality is that most of the victims willing to go on the record against high profile fashion names were relatively unknown male models rather than A-list female celebrities, meaning ultimately that their claims were less impactful and less easy to parlay into a ‘wearing black’ statement. And sadly, fashion seems far too insular, blind to its own flaws, and ultimately protective of its own to have the reckoning it really needs (if you don’t believe me, go and see which high profile figures are still happily liking Bruce Weber’s Instagram pictures). Our #MeToo moment was a long time coming, but never quite got the same momentum as that of other industries – and to be honest, it already feels like a memory. Fashion has moved on. We can’t forget, though. As the news trails off, as fewer people come forward, as the noise dies down, it’s vital we don’t plaster over the cracks that have shown in fashion’s façade, that we make sure the exploitation that was allowed to happen is no longer sanctioned or swept under the rug, that we learn from all of this moving forward. Because whether cruel bullies or out and out sexual predators, I have no doubt that abusers are still out there in the industry, still getting booked for jobs. Maybe you don’t think that the Met Gala, the most-publicised singular fashion event of the year, is the place to take a stand on these issues. But if not, where is?

"It’s pretty (okay, very) well-known that Martin Margiela is a man of few words and almost total anonymity. But last night, at the Belgian Fashion Awards, the elusive designer made his presence known when he received the night’s grand prize. Awarded the Jury Prize award for ‘his entire career and his obvious impact on the history of fashion, today’s collections, and more than likely the ones to come’, Margiela responded with a letter – come on, you didn’t think he was actually going to show up, did you? “I am very touched and indeed honoured to receive this award, here in my native country. Especially because I stepped down from fashion already ten years ago,” the letter read. “This evening my memory goes back to 1983 when I received, here in Brussels, my very first recognition: the second prize of the ‘Golden Spindle’ contest, handed to me by the then only foreign jury member, Jean Paul Gaultier.” Margiela went on to detail the reason he stepped away from his eponymous label in 2008, citing, like many designers before him, the rapid pace of fashion and the rise of social media as huge pressures on his creative output. “I felt that I could not cope any more with the worldwide increasing pressure and the overgrowing demands of trade,” he wrote. “I also regretted the overdose of information carried by social media, destroying the ‘thrill of wait’ and cancelling every effect of surprise, which was so fundamental for me.” Other winners at the awards included Willy Vanderperre, graduate designer Federica Di Leo, and Y/Project’s Glenn Martens, who took home the prize of Designer of the Year. The awards show marked the start of a month-long series of workshops, talks, and installations celebrating Belgian design at Brussels’ MAD Institute. Take a look at the full programme here, and read Martin Margiela’s letter in full below. “I am very touched and indeed honoured to receive this award, here in my native country. Especially because I stepped down from fashion already ten years ago. This evening, my memory goes back to 1983 when I received, here in Brussels, my very first recognition: the second prize of the ‘Golden Spindle’ contest, handed to me by the then only foreign jury member, Jean Paul Gaultier. Many say that fashion has a short memory as it is obsessed by actuality and novelty. But some recent exhibitions about my work exemplified the opposite. Again, my homeland Belgium was the first to honour my work at the MOMU Antwerp, and then my adoptive city Paris followed with two more, at Palais Galliera and Musée des Arts Décoratifs. A beautiful tribute to a period of hard work and dedication starting at early age and lasting for more than 30 years, until 2008 – the very year I felt that I could not cope any more with the worldwide increasing pressure and the overgrowing demands of trade. I also regretted the overdose of information carried by social media, destroying the ‘thrill of wait’ and cancelling every effect of surprise, so fundamental for me. But today, I am happy to notice again a growing interest for creativity in fashion, by some upcoming designers. This evening, I feel proud and fulfilled and I wish to thank wholeheartedly all of you for your precious support back then and today's recognition.”

"Last week, Celine revealed its first campaign since Hedi Slimane took over as creative director. Now, another couple of images have been released, straight from the label’s Paris couture house. The pictures, posted to Celine’s Instagram, are two black and white portraits, in-keeping with the back-of-the-head shot from the first half of the campaign. They’re also similarly sparse on sartorial details; one shows no more than the model’s head wrapped in crystal-studded netting, while the other model wears just a length of dark fabric around their neck (is it a scarf?). Both images also showcase the simplified (and É-less) logo redesign revealed with the house’s first two images. As for seeing Hedi Slimane’s actual designs for Celine – besides that bag showcased by Lady Gaga at the Louvre – it seems we’ll just have to wait the 20 days until his debut.

"One of the industry’s most agenda-setting make-up talents, Isamaya Ffrench has got a rep for her artistic and wildly imaginative beauty looks – she’s crafted lego masks for models at Agi & Sam, given smudged lips and sealed-off mouths to models at Junya Watanabe, and alien symbol face tattoos to Rihanna for her “Sledgehammer” music video. Now however, the beauty alchemist is turning fashion designer. Ffrench has teamed up with London-based womenswear brand Finery on a capsule collection of accessories which includes a sock boot, a mule loafer, a bucket hat, a bumbag and an earring set. “I wanted something that alluded to both sportswear and glamour,” she tell us, “hence the neoprene, crock skin buckle boot and the fur lined half trainer shoe.” The collection also draws from 90s hip hop culture, as well as Ffrench’s background in dance and sport – something that’s reflected in the aesthetic, which she describes as “sleekness with an edge of sports punk”, and the functionality of the pieces. She speaks of her love of wearing heels that feel robust enough to do hurdles in and says that she likes handbags that are equally pragmatic. “I’m not really into (them) unless they are hard-wearing so came up with the idea of an oversized crock bumbag you can almost fit your laptop in!” “It’s a real collaboration, in the sense that its 50 per cent me and 50 per cent Finery!” she goes on to say. “Our styles are quite different – I would say they are quite feminine in comparison to my masculine taste in accessories. It was great to work with and involve them in the whole process of designing a piece. I would go to them with a concept like big, chunky buckles, and they would ‘beautify’ the concept for me!” Is design something we can expect more of from Ffrench? “I’m enjoying working with accessories,” she says, “and particularly collaborations like this one – it’s nice to work with a team of people who are passionate about what they are doing. I think it’s that which gives momentum to any project.”

"Fashion is further behind than it should be when it comes to diversity, but ongoing conversations around the topic are slowly but surely paying off. When it comes black models and their increased presence on the catwalk over the years, one person to thank is Deiwght Peters – founder of Jamaican agency Saint International. In fact, his models are basically at every major runway show. During the recent AW18 womenswear shows, Saint faces walked in Chanel, Balenciaga, Burberry, Jacquemus, Gucci, Coach, and Dries Van Noten – to name a few. And it isn’t just the girls – four of the agency’s boys walked in the last Wales Bonner show, with the designer writing a special shoutout in her show notes. Founded in 2000, Peters’ agency is probably the world’s biggest go-to for black models – providing over 150 Jamaican faces to agencies all over the globe. His driving force is simple. “For me, it was always an appreciation for black skin. There is a lot of beauty in being black,” he says of what inspires him. “Coming from a small Caribbean island that is not really into fashion, it was really the idea of: ‘How do you position these faces in a way that is respected, applauded, appreciated, and they get to work with the best brands and casting directors in the world?’” More than just an agent, Peters is like a father to the young faces under his care – most of whom have never left home, let alone Jamaica. “I am very protective of my models, so they sometimes call me ‘Pops’,” he explains. Eternally optimistic, the agent doesn’t believe fashion (currently feeling the heat after revelations of mistreatment by some of its biggest stars) is a lost cause. “It all comes to an end, no matter how powerful you think these people are,” he says. “That’s what we’re witnessing now. The industry has started to evolve – it is moving away from the abusive stereotype people used to ascribe to it.” Here, we talk to Peters on founding the agency and increasing diversity within the industry. How was Saint Models first founded? Deiwght Peters: Saint started as a talent management company for musicians, but I didn’t have any background in it. Then back in 2001, one of the first televised model searches in the world was born which came about through a friend who was working for one of the top television stations in Jamaica. It was called the Faces Of Summer. During the summer months, we would go all across Jamaica and had cameras following us. It was groundbreaking because people had never seen this before, we were taking them right through the creative process of finding a new Jamaican model. It catapulted us to the forefront of the industry. People started showing respect and we started developing very close relationships with agents in all the major markets – even the more commercial ones in LA, in Miami, Chicago. I started learning and appreciating the creative dynamics of the industry; how the relationships work, the politics of it all. What do you try to bring to the industry with your agency? Deiwght Peters: Healthy, beautiful black girls and boys who definitely can represent an international brand at the highest level. It’s about really refining the eye, understanding the aesthetic of the global market, what the expectations are, and just respecting it. The market is much more democratic than it was before. You have wonderful, intelligent casting directors who are now understanding the demographics in a global space and what really will work. “As black people I believe we are confident, powerful, strong, and beautiful and once you package that within the realm of being a model you can go very far” – Deiwght Peters What is your role during the season of shows? Deiwght Peters: A lot of things! Just before the season begins, I make submissions and then you start getting feedback on who could be cast or optioned for the upcoming shows. It’s about getting everything organised and training the models before they go, how to be respectful and upbeat and positive about the experience. I work very closely with parents who trust me with their kids. I make sure everybody – the family and otherwise – are fully aware of what is expected. I’m very real so I don’t give too many false hopes or expectations. I’m not going to say to a model ‘Oh you’re booked’ from the start. It may be confirmed, it may not be confirmed. This process is new but they need to understand it, so I break it down in simple terms. So a lot of your job is being their guardian, really? Deiwght Peters: If they’re 17 or 18, to me they’re still young, especially if they are just starting out. I make sure all the appropriate paperwork is in order, making sure the correct authorisations are signed and that the visas are processed in a timely manner. Chaperoning them is definitely a key responsibility, making sure they eat on time – my Jamaican models love to eat. I don’t have a problem cooking sometimes because I just want to make sure it’s a healthy, positive experience all around. Have you found it challenging getting recognition for your models in an industry that favours Eurocentric beauty ideals? Deiwght Peters: It’s not to say that there haven’t been challenges, but what I believe is that it’s a matter of timing. Let’s take the girl who is now fronting Prada campaigns (Anok Yai), who was discovered on social media. She may have been thought as being too dark-skinned by some modelling agents, but now people can see her in a whole different space, the market is different. Over time things will evolve. Some clients I believe were just closed to what may have been a stereotype that they themselves developed about what a black model represented. I always look to Naomi Campbell and Iman from a different perspective than most people. What I like is that there’s a substantive elegance that is consistent among all these black models that make it to the top. I believe it is of paramount importance that it is not about changing who you are, or your fundamental beliefs and cultural identity. As black people I believe we are confident, we are powerful, we are strong, we are beautiful and once you package that you can go very far as a model. Do you think diversity in modelling has changed over the years? Deiwght Peters: The new age of casting directors, whether it’s Ashley Brokaw, Piergiorgio Del Moro or Anita Bitton, have played a key role in opening the doors to diversity and having more diverse runways. The designers themselves who front international brands have recognised that the global market demographic is definitely changing, so they have to make sure that their casting for the runway is consistent with what is happening now. I think one of the biggest changes has been social media and Instagram. Now, casting directors themselves are empowered, they are no longer limited by agents who might be limited in perspective, who may decide who they want to send to a casting director. Social media has democratised the casting process in that a casting director can go on Instagram and discover talent that an agent may not have fed to them because they may not represent that model in the respective market, or they may not necessarily think the model suits their ideal of the aesthetic they promote. How do you try and protect your models from dangers within the industry? Deiwght Peters: I am very open with models, I try to explain that the world is what it is, there are good people and there are bad people. It’s not about limiting it to being in modelling or fashion, it’s everywhere. I always say to them, do not sell yourself short. Do not let anyone tell you you have to do something to get something. We try to make sure the expectations are very high when it comes to integrity, I am very, very strong on that. You have to be on time, you have to be professional but I do not believe you have to do anything that makes you uncomfortable, or that you do not wish to do. I manage the models and I manage the families – it’s important that the kids can report to their mums, their dads, their uncles, their grandfathers, and not to come back with ‘I was forced to do this, I was being pressured to do that’. What have some of your highlights been over the years? Deiwght Peters: One of my fondest experiences was when I took one of my first winners of the Faces of Summer contest to Paris. One agent said to us ‘We like the girl, we’re going to send you to meet Azzedine Alaïa.’ I didn’t realise how important he was in the world of fashion. It was the most amazing experience that I still cherish to this day, and I have a picture I took in the atelier with him measuring my model. He asked us if we had problems placing her with Paris agencies and said ‘I’ll send you to meet with Karin Models,’ because that’s where Naomi Campbell was at the time. In the end, that’s where we placed her. So that was one of my first relationships in Paris. A poignant moment for me over this last season was backstage at Balenciaga. I realised that one of my models had the World Food Programme motto ‘Saving lives, Changing lives’ on her back and I was blown because the tagline for Saint is ‘Changing lives, Expanding horizons’. On that day we were celebrating a record of eight models on such a prestigious runway so it was really a moment for me to just step back and say ‘Wow, this is incredible!’ How do you plan to continue growing the agency? Deiwght Peters: People keep asking how I keep finding the models. For me, the main thing is our global brand, there are models who have been sending stuff on DM through Instagram and Facebook from Nigeria, Kenya, the US, England saying they have seen how well we have done in terms of black models. It’s about accessing more markets and giving more people an opportunity. There are several markets we’re looking at, more within the region of the Caribbean and definitely in Africa. There are some challenges, in terms of making sure things work, understanding all of the immigration processes across the world. Whether we can get a visa easily, if not. What are the barriers? It’s important for me to be informed in immigration-related matters. I want to get into more territories and create more opportunities for these young people. For me, that’s what it’s all about. @saintmodelsja

"Along with its weekly drops released today, Supreme has announced a new t-shirt created in collaboration with photographer and artist Richard Prince. The tee in question – entitled 18 & Stormy – features a composite face created out of the 18 women who have accused Trump of sexual assault, as well as Stormy Daniels. Following the release, Prince tweeted a picture of the t-shirt along with a quote from Trump reading: “I did try to fuck her. She was married. I moved on her like a bitch.” 100 per cent of the proceeds go to Downtown for Democracy, a political action committee. The tee will also be available online later today.

"When it comes to finding stars for their campaigns, fashion labels seem to be forgoing celebrities in favour of more unexpected faces. Gucci got a group of barnyard animals for its Cruise 2019 tailoring images (OK, Harry Styles was there too), and Craig Green used giant latex windmills for AW18. Now, Birkenstock has joined the club by enlisting a band of puppets for its newest campaign. That’s right. The puppet band – Birkie & the Toes – created by New York-based creative director and artist Amit Greenberg, appear in the images around NYC – wearing nothing but the footwear label’s shoes. In addition to the campaign images, the accompanying video shows the Birkie band performing their song “Get On Your Feet”. If you’re looking to become one of the band’s groupies, you can get your hands on limited edition tees and sandals created by Greenberg – featuring some of his artwork. Both pieces are available exclusively from Birkenstock’s new Soho-based NYC store.

"It’s the start of another year, and with that comes another back-to-back season of men’s, women’s, and Haute Couture shows that are set to take us all the way through to early March(!) Before LFWM starts this Saturday, and we strap in to see what the likes of Charles Jeffrey, Samuel Ross, Art School, and Mowalola Ogunlesi have in store for us, though, we’ve compiled a list of the menswear designers you won’t see on any of the established schedules. At least, for now. From the London-based graduates subverting traditional ideas of masculinity and endeavouring to make fashion a more sustainable, ethical space, to the Arca-approved creative blazing a trail for the queer community in a historically conservative former-Soviet country – these are the designers who should be on your radar in 2019. Head to Christian Stone’s Instagram and it quickly becomes apparent that the London-based designer is something of a gaming nerd. Using nylon Playstation logo disc bags and Call of Duty-inspired camo fabric to create thigh-length platform boots, and manipulating Ziploc bags into unique, see-through corsets, Stone’s boundary-pushing, imaginative designs skew traditional ideas of gender and imagine what humans might be wearing 100 years into the future – or what they might look like were they to morph into computer game-esque superhero or supervillain versions of themselves. The designer’s approach has already garnered him a sizeable (and dedicated) fanbase, with A$AP Rocky wearing one of his fishing net balaclavas in his FKA twigs-featuring “Fukk Sleep” video. Not only is Westminster MA graduate Priya Ahluwalia intent on bringing her radically creative collections to the world, she’s committed to doing so in an entirely responsible, socially conscious way – with sustainability a key focus within her work. Born and raised in London and of Indian-Nigerian descent, the designer channels the energy of her dual heritage into her unique collections, as she repurposes vintage denim jackets and nylon track tops into oversized trenches, and pieces together knitted panels to create new sweaters and vests. Last year, she travelled to Panipat, India and Lagos, Nigeria to see how clothes are recycled and reused there, and subsequently released a book, Sweet Lassi, which documented her journey and the vast amounts of second-hand clothing being shipped there. “When I saw the sheer amount of clothing that was piled high in these warehouses and in these massive lorries that have all of them hanging out of the back, it was a real eye-opener seeing how much waste we all produce and how much we overbuy,” she explained to us back in June. “Looking at the piles and bundles was when I thought of the idea of patchworking things together to create new textiles.” London-based label Maromas was founded by Thomas Harvey and Mauro Pitteri while the two were studying at London College of Fashion, and explores black masculinity, sexuality, and the designers’ Caribbean and Argentinian heritages respectively. The pair’s final collection was presented as part of guerilla grad show Burn The Man last summer and tapped into the contradictions that lie at the heart of the Jamaican dancehall scene, with models striding down the runway in cut-out cycling shorts, skin-tight mesh tops painted with flowers, Dandy-esque silk brocade suits, and vertiginous stiletto heels. “Being homosexual in Jamaica is seen as a negative thing, which is quite amusing when you look at how flamboyant heterosexual men are in their fashion and dance styles,” explains Harvey. “Their take on style is fully formed and beautiful, but to actually be gay is rejected. We want to explore that juxtaposition.” Despite having only graduated a little over six months ago, Maromas recently took over London’s ICA with an immersive catwalk experience as part of a day celebrating young QTIPOC talent – and this is just the beginning. Though the fashion industry’s initial interest in Georgia – and particularly its capital, Tbilisi – was stoked by the success of Demna Gvasalia at Vetements and Balenciaga, a new generation of rising designers are ensuring the spotlight stays focused firmly in its direction. Among them is Aka Prodiashvili, who draws inspiration from the city’s DIY underground clubbing scene and its vibrant LGBTQ+ community, challenging Georgia’s conservative values with his progressive, gender-skewing designs. For SS19, Prodiashvili channelled his frustration at the violent raids of revered techno club Bassiani, the corruption that permeates the Georgian government, and the homophobia that’s still rife on Tbilisi’s streets into a collection that celebrated the progressive, open outlook of the next generation, with clashing animal motifs, lurid colour combinations, and powerful, imposing silhouettes all key. He’s also gained a fan in Dazed favourite Arca, who has been spotted in more than a few of his pieces in recent months. Debuting her final MA collection as part of the Parsons graduate show during New York Fashion Week in September, creative Madeleine Hogan (who designs under the name Floyd Hogan) questioned contemporary masculinity with her unique, conceptual offering. Drawing inspiration from the glory days of WWE wrestling – namely the 80s and 90s – Hogan sent a series of oversized parachute pants, ruched and panelled track tops, and subtly flamboyant tailored pieces down the runway, many of which appeared blown up to inhuman proportions or delicately deflated. It was, she explained, an exploration of society’s fetishisation of the muscled male form and its bearing on sexuality. Soon after, she was approached by Nike and has since moved to the West coast of the US to hone her skills under the sportswear behemoth. A definite one to watch.

"Taken from autumn 2018 issue of Dazed. You can buy a copy of our latest issue here. “I’m from the east side of Harlem, which was the power base when I was growing up in the 50s and 60s. I was always in awe of the Rat Pack – they influenced fashion. Before that, it was James Cagney and Edward G Robinson, the guys who played gangsters in Hollywood movies. But my biggest influence came from the Italians in East Harlem. Those were the first people in the ghetto we saw with Cadillacs, diamond rings, silk suits, all that. “The experience that shaped my relationship with clothes and how transformative they could be came about as a result of how poor we were. We used to put paper in our shoes to cover the holes in the sole. Then we got more innovative and started putting in linoleum, because it didn’t wear out as fast. One day, when I was eight years old, I came home and my feet were killing me. My oldest brother took me to a Goodwill store. He asked, ‘You see any shoes you like?’ I saw some split-toe shoes with tassles. I took off my shoes and tried them on. They felt good. He said, ‘OK, take your shoes, put them on the rack. Let’s go.’ I will never forget that. I took care of those shoes like they were a living thing. They made me feel like somebody. “Those shoes were also my initiation into elements of criminality. Later on, I used to boost my own clothes. I call it the ‘Robin Hood complex’. It’s OK if you need it. That led to me being involved in street things. I grew up before the drug epidemic. When that came, I chose to retreat. I went back to school and got pretty radical. “While I was at college, I was a professional gambler. I held all my money while I was hustling. In 1981, I bought a $40,000 Mercedes Benz and said, ‘I don’t wanna gamble any more.’ I was going through a spiritual transition and had to find something else to do. I said, ‘Since all the street people in Harlem know me, I’ll open a store and sell to them.’ “When you’re a professional gambler, you have to be this guy that everybody wants to be. I was always fly. My position was to win money; their position was to win me so they could accumulate some of that magic I had going on. The store was a continuation of that. If you follow fashion in inner cities, Harlem in particular, you’ll know we accumulate things to show we are moving up in the world. On the street level, a shift was taking place. It was no longer the Rat Pack; it was exclusive brands that cost money. Then it shifted to me. “Initially I started with furs, but I needed another outlet. I got into brands when a guy came into the store with a Louis Vuitton pouch and everybody got excited. I thought, ‘Wow, if they all got excited about that pouch, imagine how they would feel if they had a coat like that?’ It went from that point on. What made my spot so hot was that all the gangsters knew me coming up. In each neighbourhood, we have those who rise to the top and, like Flannery O’Connor says, ‘Everything that rises must converge.’ In Harlem, that’s what it is. Everybody knew who I was. “125th is the boulevard – it’s where everybody goes and knows everybody. It’s like the jugular vein that feeds the brain and the heart. Everyone passes through there. So I wanted to be there but, you know what, everything I needed was here (on Lenox Avenue, the new atelier’s location), and Gucci recognised that. The partnership happened because Marco Bizzarri and Alessandro Michele have a vision about fashion: what it should be, what it should mean to people, where it should go, and how to reach this new immersion. All these elements came together to make this happen. “They looked at me as someone who thinks outside the box – without realising that I was born outside the box” – Dapper Dan “In the beginning, I didn’t accept that. I’d never seen that. They looked at me as someone who thinks outside the box – without realising that I was born outside the box. Marco and Alessandro made me realise the outside world is changing. “Every day, people stop me on the street. When I get up in the morning, I put on the flyest outfit and take the bus so I can interact with people, see what they are wearing, and see how they respond to what I’m wearing. I have to connect. Everything under God proceeds from the forces of energy and information. I’m picking up things. I’m looking for coolness. I’m looking for how to make them say, ‘Damn, I wanna be like Dapper Dan.’ “This isn’t Hollywood. This is the real thing. I’m not playing with this game, man. I’m gonna live this Harlem thing. You’re never gonna see me in the plastic world. When I can’t interact with the young kids who come out of school, with the old guys, when I can’t feel that vibration, I don’t need to be here any more. “When I walk down these streets, I see it the way it is as well as the way it was. I get multiple visions from the growth that took place, the hardships, the joys... I see all of that. I’m completely connected to the people here. I belong to them. To have somebody who has always been here, who can walk among them and jive-talk with them – that is the Harlem I grew up with. I grew up with James Baldwin, Langston Hughes, Count Basie, Tito Puente and Joe Cuba. I grew up with a multicultural Harlem. How could anything compare to that?” – Dapper Dan Grooming John McKay at Frank Reps using Koh Gen Do, talent Camille Elliot, Coco Gordon-Moore at Midland Agency, Willa Best-Doyle at IMG, Tori Alexander, Si Yuan Chen, Dasede Harris, Evan Luis, Gabriella Nunez, Aaqil Oliver, Avah Rose, Vicky Sun, Edwin Villafana, Youma Wague, photography assistant Lumia Nocito, styling assistant Jessica Aurell, production Kalena Yiaueki at North6, production coordinator Irina Chelidze, production assistant Will Thompson, casting Midland Agency at Management + Artists

"You know 1017 Alyx 9SM (formerly just Alyx) by now – if not for reaching the finals of the LVMH Prize, its recent Nike collab or its signature Rollercoaster belt, then at least for rarely being off the backs of models like Bella Hadid. Riding on the high of being commissioned to design a new ‘CD’ buckle for Kim Jones’ Dior menswear debut this week, designer Matthew Williams last night put on his first ever runway show in Paris. “It just felt like the right time,” he shared from a chaotic temporary studio space the day before, where it was all systems go as models came in an out for fittings. “I’ve always dreamt of doing it, ever since I started in fashion. Plus, we can count on some people showing up this time!” That start came around a decade ago, when he logged experience as a creative director working with some of the biggest names in music (one of whom, a Mr Kanye West, could be glimpsed behind the DJ booth at the brand’s euphoric after party last night). From there, Williams became a founding member of influential creative collective #BeenTrill#, working with fellow designers Heron Preston and Virgil Abloh. The California native isn’t just worth knowing by association, though – since its first season for AW15, Alyx has been regularly making womenswear that women actually want to wear: blending Italian-made tailoring with street-ready pieces that regularly recall punk, fetish, and skate subcultures. Thankfully for the boys, it introduced menswear in 2017. Its rise has been somewhat stratospheric – the long queue snaking down the street of hopefuls trying to get in to see the show was a testament to that. For Williams, who named the label (Alyx is pronounced ‘Ah-leeks’, FYI) after his eldest daughter with wife Jennifer, collections aren’t necessarily tied to certain broad references or generic print-outs on a moodboard. It’s more about tapping into his own memories. “We don’t really do themes, you know?” the designer says. “We’re inspired by clothing or we’re inspired by culture, music…” This season that emerged onto the runway in a co-ed collection which both presented and built upon the codes Williams has established at Alyx over the past three years – including the signature buckle, taken from a Six Flags rollercoaster ride; extremely technical fabrications mixed with industrial details; and a kind of hard-edged femininity which both recalls the spirit of heyday Helmut Lang and feels entirely essential for women right now. Thanks to backpack-covering outerwear, shoes with detachable hiking soles by Vibram, caps with drawstring hood attachments, and the hi-tech sportswear touches brought in thanks to the Nike collaboration (including the first jointly-produced shoe), there was an element of the survivalist in the collection – a kind of urban adventurer preparing for both the elements and the pulsing dance floor of an underground club. The looks were modelled by a line-up featuring some familiar faces including model muses Molly Bair, Drake Burnette and Stella Lucia; Xim, a designer who is part of G-Dragon’s crew; and Ecco2k and Bladee, musicians from Sweden. John Ross, a teenage Instagram influencer with a slightly nihilistic personal brand better known by his moniker @interlockshorts, wore a black American flag sweatshirt and loped down the runway to Suicide’s “Ghost Rider”. “John Ross is like my little brother from LA – like a duplicate of me at seventeen,” Williams said. “Regardless of all the other dynamics that happen in our country, you can’t change the fact that I’m American, and that experience has made me who I am” – Matthew Williams Williams’ own California upbringing is also a major source of inspiration – although he relocated with his family to Italy to be close to the factories making his products, he’s still designing from an American point of view. Beyond the obvious motifs (and the unobvious ones, like prints made from photos Williams has taken over the years in cities like DC, LA and New York) this showed. Pieces of the collection – white tank tops, snakeskin pants, clompy square-toed boots – were pretty much the late-90s uniform of don’t-fuck-with-me girls like Buffy’s Faith, and it also felt heavy on the mall goth stereotypes: jeans had chains hanging off them or straps connecting the legs, one blazer had a crossbones pinstripe motif. If that sounds like a load of adolescent fashion clichés, it shouldn’t – the collection took these pieces and elevated them far, far beyond anything you’d pick up on a pilgrimage to Hot Topic. And while it might seem like an interesting time to be gunning for the Stars and Stripes (when even famous aesthetic patriot Lana Del Rey recently announced she no longer feels comfortable using it in her visuals), Williams is candid about his motivations. “Regardless of all the other dynamics that happen in our country, you can’t change the fact that I’m American, and that experience has made me who I am,” he explained. “(With) the pieces, I still wanted to strongly say that I’m from California, New York, that I’m American… these are the things that are meaningful and important to me.”

"Selena Gomez has been unveiled as one of the models for Louis Vuitton's new womenswear campaign. Shot by Bruce Weber, the former Disney star-turned-singer and actress features alongside former Dazed cover stars Rianne van Rompaey and Natalie Westling in a series of shots for the label. The new images follow the Louis Vuitton Cruise 17 show in Rio earlier this month, held at the city’s Niterói Contemporary Art Museum, designed by Oscar Niemeyer. The show, inspired by the modernist architect, saw van Rompaey, Westling and Dazed 100’s Lineisy Montero walk the runway with Series.4 model Jaden Smith watching from the front row. This latest campaign may seem an unlikely pairing for some, considering the direction Ghesquière took his previous womenswear campaign, for which Smith and video game character Lightning from Final Fantasy XIII were cast. However, the decision to use Gomez may not come as much of a surprise to eagle-eyed followers of Ghesquière’s Instagram, as it would seem that she has become somewhat of a muse for the artistic director. The two have been hanging out recently, and Ghesquière teased his followers with what we now know to be backstage shots from the Series.5 campaign.

"British fashion designer Stuart Vevers has teamed up photographer Juergen Teller and Queen Bey’s creative director Todd Tourso (he directed Lemonade, people) on luxury leather brand Coach’s new Autumn 2019 campaign. No, it does not feature Selena Gomez, a longterm muse. Rather, Teller captures what Vevers describes as “21st Century Dreamers” to star in the campaign – from Yara Shahidi to Jemima Kirke, Liu Wen to Miles Heizer. Keeping the brand’s New York City DNA alive, the talents are filmed in iconic NY locations (think the Brooklyn Bridge, Central Park, and the Manhattan Ferry). In Tourso’s film, meanwhile, the ambassadors are depicted as superheroes, running through the city at intense speed; standing 50 stories high on top of New York’s sweeping skyscrapers; and even free-floating in the Manhattan sky, while they pose questions about their dreams becoming a reality, finding their voices and standing up for what they believe in. “How do we create spaces in which we do acknowledge this underlying humanity we have?” and “Who are we if not each other?” asks Dazed 100-er, actor, and activist Yara Shahidi. Check out the images in the gallery above.

"She’s already modelled for Roberto Cavalli and been shot by major industry names like Mario Testino and Inez & Vinoodh, but now the “Monster” rapper has officially become a model, signing with agency powerhouse, Wilhelmina Models. Responsible for the careers of icons including Iman and original supermodel (as well as ill-fated subject played by Angelina Jolie in the cult film named for her), Gia Carangi – the agency is a perfect fit for the star who isn’t shy with her fashion choices. Nothing if not adaptable, Minaj channelled this penchant for theatrics into something seemingly more demure for our Autumn/Winter 2014 issue, where she played a hyperreal housewife (still decked out in Chanel and Dior of course, though). Speaking to us then, she said: “When I think of the female icons I love and look up to, I don’t think they were ever predictable. I just want to be unpredictable and fearless.” Telling Vogue (who broke the announcement) about this new venture, the rapper said: “I love the synergy between my music and how it inspires my fashion. My message is always celebrating your own style. I’m thrilled and honoured to have signed with Wilhelmina – they get me.”

"Ahead of an eagerly-anticipated AW17 show in New York tomorrow, Raf Simons’ eponymous label has dropped its SS17 campaign – featuring the celebrated collaboration with the estate of late photographer Robert Mapplethorpe. Lensed by long-term collaborator Willy Vanderperre and styled by Olivier Rizzo, the campaign features models including Simons’ go-to muse Yannick Abrath. Entirely black and white and shot in a space which recalls the location of some of Mapplethorpe’s famous images of Patti Smith, the series includes the collection’s key pieces – some of which feature prints of the photographer’s work and others (like leather caps and black belt chokers) which nod towards his signature sexuality. The SS17 collection was first presented at Pitti in Florence last June, marking the third time the Belgian had teamed up with the menswear tradeshow. But rather than the designer reaching out to instigate the collaboration, it was actually The Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation who approached Simons. He eagerly accepted their request to work together, hoping a collaboration might help bring the photographer’s oeuvre to a new demographic. “I want to challenge myself also for the Foundation to hopefully make it believable to a different audience… (to) reach out to different generations, not only people who are following art,” he said backstage. Aside from the campaign and show tomorrow, Simons will be debuting his first collection as chief creative officer of Calvin Klein at New York Fashion Week on February 10th.

"It’s Saturday night at the men’s edition of Milan Fashion Week which can only mean one thing: it’s time for Donatella to present her vision for SS20 at Versace (that’s Ver-sah-chay, not Ver-sah-chee, remember?). Didn’t bag a seat on the frow? Don’t panic: we’ve got you covered. Here’s everything you need to know. ...of a v boxy, 90s-esque black sports car, from which hundreds of pink and white flowers had piled out of the doors and on to the floor. The catwalk itself was pale pink and polished to a high shine. So far, so glam. Obvs. Though officially this was a menswear show, Donatella’s gang of Versace girls was out in force, with Irina Shayk, Gigi and Bella Hadid, Adut Akech, and Stella Maxwell all making their way round the catwalk. The first looks out onto the runway drew on the New Wave era, with models wearing cinched leather trenches, severe buttoned up shirts, and classic black ties, before a series of half-and-half black and grey suits followed soon after (can we get Tyler on the phone?). Later, things got more relaxed, as a series of ravey looks appeared, featuring tie-dye t-shirts, bold baroque-print trousers, shirts featuring sports car motifs, and wrap-around sunglasses. Last onto the runway was series of tailored looks, with Bella Hadid wearing perhaps the most 90s look ever: a sparkly blazer with matching bootcut trousers, layered over a triangle bra. We didn’t necessarily have her down as a huge Prodigy fan, but Donatella seemingly drew inspiration from the band’s iconic frontman (who died earlier this year) this season, with rave classic “Firestarter” appearing on the soundtrack, and models with pink, yellow, and green horned hair all storming down the runway. Flint may be gone, but his influence is in absolutely no way forgotten.

"Last month, AnOther Magazine unveiled the covers of its 15th-anniversary issue starring a quartet of cultural icons: Björk, Grimes, Kate Moss and Kristen Stewart. Now, the magazine has added a fifth person to this line-up: Karl Lagerfeld. The brainchild of co-founder Jefferson Hack, the 3D hologram of the fashion designer was created by award-winning holographer and artist Rob Munday and will cover 1000 copies of the magazine. To create the hologram, Munday went to Lagerfeld’s private photography studio in Paris equipped with his 3D camera system. From there he proceeded to take 50 high-resolution images of the Chanel creative director, from a variety of angles. Speaking on the experience, Munday says, “Working with Karl was a joy, largely because he was so open to the whole idea of being immortalised in 3D. He was fascinated by the medium and the technology and exclaimed several times when seeing the results that it was ‘the future’.” “At the end of the shoot I presented the final 3D portrait to Karl, displayed on a large format 3D TV,” he goes on to say. “He was particularly happy to see that the picture of his beloved cat Choupette, inlaid into his stunning diamond encrusted tie pin...” The cover has been unveiled on the same day as Chanel’s AW16 ready-to-wear show – and with good reason; the issue comes complete a 30-page profile of the designer written by AnOther’s editor-in-chief Susannah Frankel, and a shoot containing looks from the six Chanel runway collections of 2015, photographed by Colin Dodgson and styled by Katie Shillingford. But of course, it’s not the first time AnOther has pushed the boundaries of traditional print publishing. Last year, for its SS15 issue, the magazine debuted the world’s first moving LED magazine cover, starring Rihanna. An enlarged portrait of the cover will be exhibited at Colette in Paris for two weeks from the 8th March 2016. The issue is available exclusively at stores including Colette in Paris, Selfridges in London, and the Tate Modern, priced at £75.

"When you think of the name Sorrenti, it’s likely photographers Mario or Gray that spring to mind. One Sorrenti you might not be so familiar with, though, is Davide – something filmmaker Charles Curran is on a mission to rectify with See Know Evil. The feature-length documentary chronicles the charismatic photographer’s brief, eventful life, as told by his family, his closest friends, and his collaborators. Born in Naples in 1976, Davide and his family – mother Francesca and brother Mario, both photographers, and sister Vanina, a stylist – moved to New York in the early 80s. By the time the 90s rolled around, the teenager had established himself as one of the most exciting photographers in the business, having spent his adolescence lensing the city’s vibrant youth and sneaking on to his family’s shoots to capture inventive, intimate portraits of some of the world’s most sought-after models. Before long, he was booking his own jobs, with fashion houses enamoured by his raw, untouched images and his aversion to the glamour and perfection that permeated the industry at that time. In Davide’s photos, the likes of girlfriend Jaime King and Milla Jovovich are captured almost candidly, with their hair unkempt and their faces bare. Alongside brother Mario, who famously shot a series of (now iconic) stripped-back photos of then-girlfriend Kate Moss, Davide pioneered the gritty, so-called ‘heroin chic’ look of the era. “I think of him as a really heroic figure, because he knew he was sick but he didn’t give up; he just thought ‘fuck it’ and decided to really go for it. He wasn’t afraid of anything” – Charles Curran Sadly, the young photographer’s career was cut short in 1997, when he died aged just 21. Despite his groundbreaking work, his reputation was tarnished by salacious reports inaccurately claimed he had died of a heroin overdose. While he had become involved with the drug, in reality, his death was caused by Cooley’s Anemia: a rare blood disorder which saw him confined to a hospital bed on a regular basis throughout his tragically short life. The press chose largely to ignore this in favour of a more sensational headline. Instead, the label plastered all over his legacy – ‘heroin chic’ – overshadowed his story to the extent that his family refused to license his unpublished work in the years following his passing. Now, over 20 years later, See Know Evil peels back the layers of inaccuracy and reframes his work through the lens of his lifelong illness, and the passion it sparked within him to maximise his time on earth. From his iconic ‘Models Suck’ tee to his haunting portraits of Jaime King, Davide’s life and work are pieced together to tell his story; the results are inspiring and occasionally hilarious, but ultimately heartbreaking. Ahead of the film’s release, here we sit down with Curran to talk Davide’s youthful creativity, the beauty of his work, and the media’s willingness to demonise him without fully exploring his story. What inspired you to make See Know Evil? Charlie Curran: I started working on this when I was 20, which was the same age Davide was when he died. I stumbled on his work by chance when I saw a book – if I remember rightly it was Fashion, Desire, and Anxiety by Rebecca Arnold – open at a page on his work, so I dug into it; I was shocked that someone of my age could make images with that gravity, that kind of teenage angst. As I started looking into it, I realised the media had done him this huge disservice by stigmatising him because he was young, there were drugs involved, and it was fashion. He became the poster boy of ‘heroin chic’, so his family cut off all license to his unpublished work. I decided I was going to try and figure it all out. Was it difficult getting access to everyone you interviewed, given the controversy? Charlie Curran: I just emailed Mario telling him I had never made a documentary before, but that I wanted to make a student film about his brother. I was stubbornly persistent. Eventually Davide’s mother Francesca told me to come sit down with her, and I told her I thought it was a really important story for kids with a similar past to see. When she saw where I was coming from she made a list of like 25 names and said: ‘If you’re able to interview these people, you’ll have the real story.’ So, not knowing any better, I did it – I was using my uncle’s air miles, because he works for an airline, to try and knock out one interview at a time. Eventually I had all the names crossed off. There’s an implication at the start of the film that the fashion industry is less willing to take a chance on young talent now. Do you think fashion’s relationship with youth has changed? Charlie Curran: I don’t mean to be bleak (by insinuating fashion can’t recapture the 90s spirit), but I think the 90s were exceptional. A young photographer could hustle an interview with a creative director; they could bring their prints and get a commission, now everything is mediated through social media and these new ways of gatekeeping. I hope (the film) presents an opportunity for people to look back at the 90s and see that was a really positive aspect of the time. I hope the industry tries to emulate that or bring those ideas back into the fold. “Davide followed the tradition of people like Bob Richardson, Richard Avedon, and Nan Goldin in the sense that people told me he considered himself a reportage photographer, not a fashion photographer. He was much more interested in that” – Charles Curran There’s a clip of Anna Wintour calling heroin chic a ‘pathetic moment’ for fashion and another of someone saying it was about cutting through glamour. Do you think the aesthetic has been misunderstood? Charlie Curran: I think there are positive and negative aspects – there are definitely shades of grey, so I try to present the different sides and let the audience draw their own conclusion. Personally, I think it was about a rejection of the ostentatious, commercial 80s. In the 60s and 70s, there was real countercultural potential and revolutionary thoughts, but then the 80s came along with their hyper-commercialisation of most aspects of life. I think the 90s was a natural recalibration of that, and it’s been going back and forth ever since. I do think we’re coming back to that 90s mentality now. There’s also a clip of Jaime explaining that the photo described as the ‘image of heroin chic’ was really just about exploring the idea of somebody dying before their time... Charlie Curran: Definitely, and viewing that in the context of Davide’s history and his illness makes it all make perfect sense – you can see why he’d be interested in people that died before their time. The press was so eager to cherry-pick an image where they could paint this narrative, and then it spread to The New York Times. But (the controversy) also speaks to how powerful fashion and image-making are, especially when they’re combined. It’s almost like dynamite. It can be good or bad – but we only hear about the bad. What do you think Davide’s influence on the fashion industry was? Charlie Curran: Davide followed the tradition of people like Bob Richardson, Richard Avedon, and Nan Goldin in the sense that people told me he considered himself a reportage photographer, not a fashion photographer. He was much more interested in that. At the same time though, he was born into this royal family of fashion, so I really hope we see the release of his work because his archive is huge! It captures this moment in time, and you can see so many forces in it that shaped that intersection of youth culture, nightlife, hip hop, and fashion. I think he was trying to document that last genuine youth movement in New York history before (former mayor) Giuliani sanitised it. New York is kind of an adult Disneyland today, so (Davide) was cognisant enough to recognise how special that moment was. The ‘Models Suck’ tee was worn by the likes of Naomi Campbell and Milla Jovovich. Why do you think it became so iconic? Charlie Curran: I think it’s to do with the era – it was kind of anti-commercial. In terms of image-making, there was a rejection of that intersection between fashion and commerce which is so amplified now, and models weren’t just models – they were personalities. I think that’s why a lot of them rocked that tee. It seemed self-aware and self-deprecating, but I don’t think it was saying ‘models suck, and you suck because you’re a model’; I think they wore it to say ‘we’re not just a name, or a board at a go-see. I’m not just a model’. Despite the pretty heavy subject matter, the film feels celebratory. Was it a conscious decision to pull through that thread of positivity? Charlie Curran: That’s what I see in his work. I think of him as a really heroic figure, because he knew he was sick but he didn’t give up; he just thought ‘fuck it’ and decided to really go for it. He really wasn’t afraid of anything. If you’re forced to face your mortality at such a young age then really what’s the worst that could happen? The way he oriented his life is positive and inspiring; I don’t know if I would have been so brave or bold as to live life the way I wanted to in his situation. That’s what I hope people see in this work – how he chose to use his short amount of time. “I hope people find that ten seconds of courage they need to do something they’re unsure of by looking at how Davide chose to live life. I think that’s the most inspiring thing” – Charles Curran How important was it to clear up the misinformation around Davide’s death with the film? Charlie Curran: I think we always overestimate how media-literate the public is. If people don’t know him they just see that he’s young, he’s in fashion and he died of a heroin overdose, so they jump to conclusions really quickly. Most media outlets aren’t incentivised to research; they’re driven by selling papers, so the more scandalous they can make a story the better. All those forces created this narrative, but then the media is so quick to move on, so his family is left with that. They were going through this while they were trying to mourn, so they just didn’t want his work out there to be appropriated in the culture wars of the time. Now, I really hope we can represent his work in an alternative way, because (that lack of archive) is a real disservice. What did you learn about Davide through making See Know Evil? What do you want audiences to take away from it? Charlie Curran: I didn’t really have any perceptions going into the project, I was just really floored by his images and wanted to figure out how someone that was just 20 years old could make them. For me it was an adventure to piece his story together, so what I’ve learned I hope I’ve left in the film – I hope that inspiration I found in his work comes through. As for the audience, I hope people find that ten seconds of courage they need to do something they’re unsure of by looking at how Davide chose to live life. I think that’s the most inspiring thing; here we are 21, 22 years later still talking about him, so I really hope people get that ten-second inspiration that Davide could really bring to people. @see_know_evil See Know Evil is currently on limited release around the world, with wider release soon to be announced.

"After only a season trialling the see-now-buy-now method of selling straight from the runway, Tom Ford has decided to cut his losses and move on. The designer confirmed that making his entire AW16 collection available immediately after his show last September ultimately lost him sales, stating that the “store shipping schedule doesn’t align with the fashion show schedule.” The fast-fashion approach came to the world’s attention last year – Burberry announced its intentions first, with Ford, Tommy Hilfiger, and Ralph Lauren following suit. While the see-now-buy-now method is aimed to speed up time between the runway and in-store availability, Ford fell victim to shipping complications. Having to put the AW16 collection on hold before it hit stores meant he lost a month of selling and, in turn, led the company to lose vital press attention – quite the opposite of what the strategy promises customers and brands alike. Of course, it works for some – at Moschino, Jeremy Scott has sold a capsule range from the new collection straight off the runway since his first show. In other news, the American designer has also suggested he is looking to return to NYFW – Ford has enjoyed a reign of shows at LFW since 2013. He was quoted saying “I like going first, when everyone is still in a good mood”, light-heartedly referring to NYFW being the first week on the calendar in the gruelling bi-annual fashion month.

"Whether you’re swapping Co-Star details with your Hinge match to work out whether it’s worth dragging yourself on a first date or not, or blaming basically every little thing that goes wrong on Mercury being Retrograde, over the course of the last few years we’ve become more obsessed with astrology than ever. Tapping into that fixation is London jeweller Stephen Webster, who this week releases a new necklace collection he’s dubbed Astro Balls: The Second Coming. Having first debuted a set of similar styles back in 2007, the necklaces depict the signs of the Zodiac – as crafted from 18ct gold. At the centre of each is the ‘Astro Ball’ itself, which takes the form of a pure pearl. Additionally, each one can also be worn as an earring with sleepers also available (ideal for all those indecisive Geminis out there, obvs). The collection is completed with something of a curveball: a 13th necklace depicting the 13th Zodiac sign. Falling between November and December, Ophiuchus is represented by a serpent with a black pearl at its centre, and designed for those who live close to the edge, by their own rules. Who knew? Head here to see the full collection.

"Last year, Moncler founded its Genius project, inviting a group of designers – Simone Rocha and Valentino’s Pierpaolo Piccioli among them – to reinterpret the label’s codes and show them through their own lens. This season saw the designers return for their sophomore collections, joined by Richard Quinn and Matthew Williams of 1017 Alyx 9SM. After making his Genius debut last year, Craig Green also returned. Known for his unique way of presenting clothing through campaigns – they’ve previously featured giant latex windmills, burning sculptures and a human liferaft – Green presented the new collaboration similarly, via some new giant sculptures. The looks – styles by Dazed’s creative and fashion director Robbie Spencer – were placed on figures he described by the designer as ‘vent men’ – material-covered wooden sculptures that were clamped to the ceiling against blowing fans, leaving it billowing as they rotated. After working on creating the sculptures with London-based set designers Isabel + Helen, the final product wasn’t tested properly until the day of the show. “We were doing all of the set up live there, it took quite a while and we didn’t manage to do a full test until the morning of the show,” Green tells us. “It was very nerve-wracking, but worked in the end.” Inspired by lightness and practicality, the AW19 looks appear to be heavy – like the oversized meme-ready looks from last time – but can be completely compacted down into small squares. Picking the lightest materials during the fabrication process, Green and his team were able to develop techniques which allow the clothes to be easily worn day-to-day by the wearer. “Each season, we try to base it around an aspect of Moncler’s DNA or how I see Moncler as a brand. This season, it was all about the idea of lightness,” he told us about his design approach. “I’m always fascinated that with Moncler it always looks so protective and solid, but the garments themselves are often very lightweight and easy to travel with.” While both his eponymous line and Moncler have some similar codes, Green’s approach to the collaboration differs. With his own label, Green notes that his inspiration can be found in many things, whereas his collaborations with Moncler are, “always based around protection, functionality, and technical outerwear” – celebrating the Italian brand’s sense of adventure. Green goes on to explain why he frequently uses sculptures as a way of presenting his work for both his own label and Moncler. “It’s about making very functional, approachable garments but also trying to make creative visuals that make people think or dream,” he says. “I think that’s always important in fashion.”

"What could be better than one incredibly talented designer joining your brand’s ranks? Ask anyone at Moncler and they’ll tell you: eight incredibly talented designers joining your brand’s ranks – especially when Craig Green, Simone Rocha, Pierpaolo Piccioli of Valentino, and Fragment’s Hiroshi Fujiwara are among them. As part of new project ‘Genius’, the Italian outerwear specialist has assembled a group of (surprise!) design geniuses who will each create a capsule collection for the label. The latest in a series of labels turning their back on the established fashion schedule, the collections will be launched on a month-by-month basis to keep up with the ever-increasing demand for newness. No stranger to the art of the collab, Moncler have previously worked alongside designers including Junya Watanabe and Thom Browne, while Craig Green already has a collaborative capsule collection under his belt (as worn by Skepta). Slightly more of a curveball is Rocha’s inclusion on the line-up: we’re excited to see how her feminine aesthetic translates into practical outerwear. Kicking off Milan Fashion Week on February 20, Genius HQ – an apartment block with a single designer showcased in each flat – will throw open its doors to unveil all eight collections under one roof. You’ll have to wait a while to get your hands on the first, though: Pierpaolo Piccioli’s will launch in the summer.

"In 1936, Salvador Dalí was in London for the International Surrealist exhibition. At the time he was dead broke and signed a deal with Edward James, poet and furniture obsessive, promising a whole year’s worth of Dalí’s output go straight to James. Doing some redecorating, James asked Dalí to design and make him some furniture – and what was born was the first ever “Mae West” lip sofa. Based on his earlier works, ‘Face of Mae West’, which saw the Hollywood actress’s facial features hung in different locations across a painting, this lip sofa was the first time the lips, detached from the face, had been used in such a standalone way. In 2017, we have lip emojis, lip kits, lip fillers, lip phone-cases: this symbol, which became somewhat synonymous with the unnerving, illogical, dreamlike output of surrealism’s super-reality, has become a reference point for many fashion designers that, despite fashion’s fickleness, has never gone out of style. Surrealism’s influence on fashion was sparked by the genius Elsa Schiaparelli, who wasn’t referencing the movement but was, instead, in it. In constant collaboration with avant-garde artists such as Dalí and Jean Cocteau, Schiaparelli was fashion’s first, and perhaps only, true surrealist designer. Over Paris Fashion Week, the surrealist lip motif seems to have appeared once again. Dancing across printed dresses and scarves at Dries Van Noten, big and bejewelled on a baby blue dress at Undercover or in gold at Clare Waight Keller’s Givenchy debut, there seems to be an underlying trend for odes to Dalí. Of course, these are not the first, and won’t be the last. Here, we look back at the times fashion’s greats paid lip-service to surrealist lips. Schiaparelli was fashion’s answer to art, and perhaps her longest-lasting legacy is her lips. These lips, much like the Mae West sofa, found their way onto brooches, embroidered into dresses, as hat pins, as earrings, a prized motif across Schiaparelli’s body of work. Much like Dalí’s Mae West sofa, these lips changed the world: the surrealists bringing the erotic, the sexual, the strange, the mysterious from the world of art into wearable, or sit-able, manifestations. Hands on bras, lobsters or shoes as hats, ribs, spines and clavicles built into dresses, and bug bodies suspended onto necklaces: Schiaparelli’s oeuvre is one which would be groundbreaking even today. A button down dress, appliquéd with beaded lips – some with, some without, the cigarette – was Yves’ way off continuing the legacy of a then-ailing Schiaparelli, who died two years later. They were great friends, and Schiaparelli would be cited as one of Yves’ greatest inspirations when he wrote the foreword for her biography. While images of the dress are just as hard to find as the actual garment, Saint Laurent revived the print for his final SS01 Haute Couture collection. In repeat patterns, on stark white fabric, lips appeared over and over again in Miuccia Prada’s SS00 collection. From pussybow shirts to pleated knee-length skirts and pedal pushers, the result was obviously painfully cool, with that perfect air of Prada awkwardness. From purple, to red and black and white, lips covered everything. And when there weren’t lips there were unsheathed red lipsticks. For the accompanying campaign, the lips were in action again with that couple appeared captured mid-argument. Known for his direct approach to sex appeal during his tenure at YSL, Tom Ford drew on the house’s archive, and Yves’ love of Schiaparelli, to bring you the lip shoe and bag. In oxblood – a Ford favourite – black and nude, they were a huge hit. Over his short tenure at the Parisian house, it ended up being one of the most recognisable motifs from his time there. One of Schiaparelli’s most famous headpieces is a bright red lip, with an unlit cigarette poking out of the corner of the mouth. For SS12, Prada took it a step further and lit the cigarette, a puff of grey smoke in patent leather drifting off the side – very much reminiscent of artist Tom Wesselmann’s work. This motif of lips smoking a cigarette was released in bright patent and added to the front of a stiletto, causing outrage among the tabloids, asking fashion to ‘stop glamourising smoking.’ Of course, the similarities between Prada and Schiaparelli didn’t go unnoticed, with The Met curating an exhibition in the same year – Schiaparelli & Prada: Impossible Conversations – dedicated to the two designers. Like Ford, Hedi Slimane revisited the YSL archives when at the helm of Saint Laurent, with lips printed in red over a black dress in what became known as ‘the dress of the Summer’ that year. Appliquéd, ruby red beaded lips were stuck all over a pouffe sleeved one shoulder top, in true Slimane 80s style. Alessandro Michele’s Gucci, while firmly grounded somewhere in the seventies, takes reference from surrealism. The famous Dalí x Schiaparelli pearl and ruby lip brooch was turned into giant earrings which dangled from a pearl for SS16. The downward facing grimace of the mouth is part of the surrealist charm: not obviously sexy but certainly magnetic.

"Closing day two of Milan Fashion Week was Jeremy Scott with his latest collection for Moschino. And, as always, it was a lot. Here’s everything you need to know. But not just any pens: these were Moschino felt tip pens, in a rainbow of colours. Was it a clue as to what the American designer had in store for us? Well, obviously, yes. The show began in darkness as a telephone conversation between Jeremy Scott and Gigi Hadid played across the soundsystem. The designer was explaining – in a pretty frantic manner – that the show was about to start and all he had was his sketches. As the lights came up, guests could see piles of reference books and papers at the end of the catwalk. The designer sent out sharply-cut jacket and pencil skirt suits, ruffled cocktail dresses, 60s-style shifts, and long, sweeping gowns, as part of what was actually a v ladylike collection. Pretty much everything was made from white fabric, on which big felt-tip pen streaks were scribbled (colouring in, but make it fashion). Other models wore garments that were still attached to the fabric roll they’d been made from, with Yasmin Wijnaldum dropping hers halfway down the runway and letting it unravel behind her as she walked. Most of the models – including Scott’s faves, Kaia Gerber and Bella and Gigi Hadid – wore wide-brimmed hats that perched on the sides of their heads, which were also (surprise!) covered in scribbles, along with structured, ladylike bags and sheer tights. Elsewhere, Kendall Jenner carried a bottle of perfume, and a whole section was dedicated to the Moschino teddy bear, which has been a signature motif since the label was first founded. ...in a puffball dress, holding a bunch of flowers. Behind her, a super long train was carried by men in black body stockings. Above that, butterflies on wire danced, giving it a whole fairytale vibe – and confirming the Moschino show as the second most iconic butterfly moment of the year so far.

"There is no fashion week with an aesthetic quite as distinctive as that of Copenhagen. Where you’re never more than a few feet away from a directional, head-to-toe look from the likes of Balenciaga, Vetements, Gucci, or Off-White in Paris, London, Seoul, or even Tbilisi, when it comes to the Danish city’s biannual fashion event, attendees’ dedication to doing things the Scandi way runs deep. At CPFW SS20, which took place last week, things were no different. On the front row, flouncy, feminine dresses were finished with understated sandals and pared-back sneakers, while the allure of relaxed tailoring in the form of louche, wide-legged trousers and oversized blazers showed no sign of loosening its grip any time soon. The runway offered up a similar story, with puff-sleeved smocks, minimalistic tunics, and luxe-looking separates all featuring heavily (call it the Cecilie Bahnsen effect). There were a series of those doing things differently, though. From Ganni’s tenth anniversary show – which saw models storm the runway in ruched satin, snakeskin boots, and 2019’s answer to Britney’s iconic denim AMA’s look – and STAND’s playful, clashing leathers, to Henrik Vibskov’s characteristically avant-garde offering and Stine Goya’s ballroom-inspired presentation, here we present some of the brands proving there’s more to Copenhagen than Scandi minimalism. Where Copenhagen has previously been called out for its lack of diversity, this season it seemed that a number of designers were intent on addressing the issue. In Stine Goya’s case, this meant assembling a cast of international Voguers, who live-work-posed down the runway in the label’s clashing floral minis, geometric-print suiting, and ruffled, Pierrot-like babydoll dresses. In addition to this, the CPH-based brand also cast a number of its stars through dating app Bumble. Naturally, given the tone of the event (which took place in a gymnasium), looks were accessorised with towering heels, paper fans, and avant-garde make-up. After taking five years off the show schedule, much-loved menswer label Soulland was back for SS20. Taking to the streets to show their new-season collection, Silas Adler and Jacob Kampp-Berliner presented an offering made up of relaxed, skate-inspired bowling shirts, oversized leather coats, and pyjama-style suits emblazoned with sketchy, haphazard botanic prints. Again, the model casting was diverse – and for the first time ever, there were a series of looks designed specifically for women. Encouraging attendees to avert their attention from their iPhones for a few minutes by providing them with knitted pouches to put them in, Holzweiler’s stripped-back approach to tech was mirrored in an equally stripped-back collection. Taking place in a 1930s-era gymnasium, the show saw a wildly diverse cast storm the echoing hall in a succession of androgynous, utilitarian looks with uber-clean lines. On the line-up were loose trenches, boxy, cotton-poplin shirts with zips in place of buttons, and crisp, pressed shorts and trousers, all of which sat in stark contrast to the more-is-more, often pretty frou-frou aesthetic of other Copenhagen labels. Oh, and those floppy-brimmed hats beloved by Blossom in the 90s? Hot for SS20, according to Holzweiler. Despite the fact that dramatic thunderstorms book-ended the Ganni show, and it was touch-and-go as to whether guests would manage to stay dry between, the label’s SS20 presentation was a party from start to finish. In celebration of ten years of the brand as we now know it, models made their way around an astroturf tennis court in slinky satin wrap-dresses, over-the-knee-boots, vinyl two-pieces, and psychedelic, wide-collared shirts paired with lightweight sweater vests, all in a wildly vibrant palette. The label also continued in its mission towards a more sustainable future, opening up the Ganni kiosk, where surplus stock from previous seasons were upcycled into bucket hats, tote bags, and other accessories. Rounding things off was a performance by singer MØ – Danish girls represent.

"If you aren’t familiar with The Vampire’s Wife, it is the label launched by Susie Cave – wife of iconic singer-songwriter Nick Cave. Taking its name from an unfinished novel by her husband, it is known for feminine fashions worn by the likes of Florence Welch. Its latest release is the third in a series of limited edition tees. Created in collaboration with artist Karen Constance, the t-shirt is titled “Girl Number 3” and features a portrait of a captivating black-haired vampire delicately holding a yellow bird. The hand-printed t-shirts will be sold in a limited run of 200 pieces from Monday, with each numbered and sold in a gift box. To coincide with the t-shirt’s release, Susie has enlisted the talents of her husband who has penned a short poem revealing the vampire’s story, premiering on Dazed. Read the poem below: She is fierce, violent, of divine power, terrifying. She came up from the marshes raging wildly. Her hair is hanging in black rivers, Her eyes are green lakes, She returns with the yellow bird-spirit Kittens and a snake go in front of her.

"“I first saw it in 2003, when I was a pre-teen living in Australia. My friend had a pirated copy of the film and we decided to secretly watch it in her parents’ basement. It was before I was familiar with Larry Clark, but I remember strongly relating to the themes – family dysfunction, teen angst, sexuality. It was the first time cinema made me feel like I wasn’t alone.” Ava Nirui is explaining the first time she saw Clark’s controversial Harmony Korine-scripted cult classic Ken Park. Without giving too much away, the film tells the story of a bunch of teens as they struggle to get to grips with themselves and those around them, their burgeoning sexualities, and the usual family issues that arise during adolescence. Despite the very real issues it touched on, though, the film caused widespread moral outrage and was banned in countries around the world, including Australia, where Nirui grew up (Rotterdam, on the other hand, loved it). “A few weeks before I saw it, it was prevented from being screened at the Sydney Film Festival, and was banned and refused classification due to its violent and graphic sexual themes, which caused massive outrage in the city and sparked protests and illegal screenings,” says Nirui. “It was the first time cinema made people question the harsh censorship laws in Australia and how they were impacting the distribution and accessibility of art.” “Each item remembers a controversial scene or moment from the movie: Shawn eating out his girlfriend’s mom, the group orgy during the close of the film, and Ken Park committing suicide during the opening credits. The film is so culturally relevant, it shouldn’t be forgotten” – Ava Nirui Now, Nirui has teamed up with Clark to create a line of merch in celebration of the movie that didn’t get the recognition it deserved back in 2003. Released today, the collection features a series of hoodies, t-shirts, and posters featuring iconic scenes from the cult classic. “I wanted to create some special pieces remembering this culturally significant art film,” she says. “Each item remembers a controversial scene or moment from the movie: Shawn eating out his girlfriend’s mom, the group orgy during the close of the film, and Ken Park (aka Krap Nek) committing suicide during the opening credits. The film is so culturally relevant, it shouldn’t be forgotten.” At a time when censorship is being enforced across all areas of our lives – from Facebook’s increasingly bizarre posting guidelines, which see classical artworks removed from the site due to their ‘explicitly sexual’ nature, to the EU’s proposed ‘meme ban’ (pls no) – the collection’s release feels all the more relevant, and, though 16 years have passed since Ken Park debuted, Nirui explains she feels like nothing has changed. “Censorship is as real now as it was back then. Social media forces us to censor our bodies, our art, and our lives, which massively impacts the way we express ourselves. I have no doubt that if this movie was released now, it would be met with the same criticism, but I think it’s beautiful. It’s so important to recognise the difference between art and photography.” The collection available to buy from IDEA, and you can watch the full trailer below.

"If you aren’t familiar with the all-women fashion collective Reconstruct, it’s a name you should be looking out for. Founded last year by five friends – Laura Aanen, Alyssa Groeneveld, Kim Kivits, Michelle Lievaart and Sanne Verkleij – who met at Willem de Kooning Academy in Rotterdam, the label was founded when the group found out the school wouldn’t be holding a graduate fashion show for their class. Choosing to throw their own guerilla style presentation, they decided to continue making clothes together – officially forming the Reconstruct collective. Imagining life on a faraway planet called RE-4, the collective design for the Reconstruct Generation – basically, anyone who wants to join. “Reconstruct is not a brand, it’s a lifestyle and we want to involve everyone,” they tell us. They wanted to carry this message through to the SS19 show, making everyone stand to avoid the usual politics around sitting on the front row. After presenting collections in Amsterdam (where Reconstruct was founded) and Copenhagen, the group showed in New York for the first time, after being invited by the CFDA. “We always wanted to go to New York, it’s so amazing. We see that there’s so much interest here, and we really fit it. The people we design for are in this city because it’s so diverse and everyone can be themselves,” Reconstruct says. “We always wanted to go to New York, it’s so amazing. The people we design for are in this city because it’s so diverse and everyone can be themselves” – Reconstruct For the collection – entitled Retrograde Orbit – Reconstruct pushed the futuristic aesthetic to the next level from the opening look – two models, in a conjoined black stretch jersey tunic, accessorised with sparkling-lens sunglasses that looked like they were reflecting stars. It continued throughout, with another model appearing in a sheer variation of a space suit, and others in puffy outerwear designed to look like food packs an astronaut might take to space. Elsewhere, the collective enlisted friend and longtime collaborator Studio Dennis Vanderbroeck, who previously worked with production powerhouse Alexandre de Betak of Bureau Betak, to choreograph the model’s movements. Now on its fourth collection, the group says they have learnt so much since they first founded the label. Originally starting out with the nine members, the collective has now shrunk to five – “At the beginning, our collection was all over the place,” they explain. With a smaller group, the work has become a lot more focused. “We’re all so different but we’ve found a way to work together. Everyone has a different approach to fashion but that’s what works so well.” Wherever Reconstruct jets off to next – “going to Mars… or Uranus,” they joke – the group want you all to come for the ride. Next, the group is setting its sights on London. “We want to go everywhere. Every city has its own energy and we want to channel that.” @reconstruct.collective

"Talk about a fast turnaround. Gucci presented its AW15 menswear collection at Milan Fashion Week today under circumstances that would send less resilient brands running for the hills. Exactly ten days ago, creative director Frida Giannini left the label, over a month earlier than expected. But rather than show what Giannini had been working on before her sudden exit, Gucci took the radical decision to overhaul every single part of Giannini's final menswear collection. Everything from the models to the set, shoes and seating had been completely redesigned. The in-house team at Gucci had ten days to produce the new collection and worked round the clock, making it a true group effort – little wonder a dozen people had to crowd onto the runway for the finale. But it was head accessories designer Alessandro Michele who took the final bow, which lends some serious weight to the rumour that Gucci will select him as Giannini's successor. The show notes pointed to a ""dreamy ambiguity"" that distinguished the collection from Giannini's work. There were sheer silk chiffon bow blouses, mink-lined men's slippers and bookish spectacles. Think androgyny for the Left Bank set; a far cry from Giannini's jet-set Italian suits. ""An attitude not a silhouette; an experience not an era – the new collection is a point of departure that blurs the masculine/feminine divide and champions the youthful energy and natural confidence of today's urbanites,"" the notes explained. According to WWD, Giannini's departure was sped up to ""facilitate decision-making about the brand's future creative direction"". It'll probably still be a while until Gucci selects a designer to take over, but here is one intriguing detail from today's show. The runway soundtrack of choice was the score from A Single Man, Tom Ford's 2009 film with Colin Firth. Now there's something to chew over. Watch a livestream of the show below: Liked this?

"Led by 22-year-old, New York-based designer Scott Watts, upcoming brand GALLERY909’s first two collections have already caught the eyes of Frank Ocean and Travis Scott. A hybrid of the high-end versus the lowbrow runs throughout the brand; Watts’s mission is to create classic clothing with a contemporary vision. His third collection, titled Distance, is all about contrast: “I wanted to show that while a lot of the looks are extremely different in mood and character, they still balance each other,” he explains – whether that manifests in the blend of fitted versus voluminous silhouettes, natural versus synthetic materials, or simple versus graphic pieces. Watts even placed himself between two extremes in the making of this collection, travelling bicoastally over the last half-year. “The past six months I was living in between two major cities, LA and NY, on opposite sides of the country,” he says. “Realising the different personalities, lifestyles, cultures of people I met who lived in these contrary places definitely informed this collection. At the same time, I was intrigued by how well these people could still mix with one another – without any culture overpowering the other.” He claims that this way of bringing together different elements to create one grand and holistic idea is influenced by his background in visual arts, primarily photography. Eventually, he went from shooting to making clothes for his subjects to wear. And as he and his design visions matured, Watts was in need of a solid company to incubate his ideas. “GALLERY 909 has always been more of community that has matured into a company,” he says of the brand’s structure – which includes friends and associates. If it sounds a little heavy for someone 22, “running a company while young has its benefits,” he says. “You automatically get more people to listen in an industry increasingly driven around youth. Different companies are now trying to get consultation from young people, in order to stay relevant themselves. But being young at the helm yourself is different.” Prior to every collection, Watts says he asks himself a series of almost existential questions: “What would I like to see in the world? What would I champion? What am I currently interested in, or experiencing, which also reflects what my group is interested in?” Naturally, he’s thinking ahead – and expansion is next for GALLERY909. Over the past season, various stores and galleries have reached out in hopes to collaborate with the brand, which has made Watts able to elaborate on his vision, the clothing and the material produced. Having previously produced short films in the past, GALLERY909 is now working on a book to accompany the new collection. As Watts puts it: “The only way to really solidify your voice is to grow.” @gallery909

"Fashion is full of designers that draw inspiration from wildly obscure cultural reference points – over the course of the last few weeks alone we’ve seen Demna Gvasalia commandeer a Paris McDonald’s and subvert the chain’s globally recognised uniform, Donatella Versace dip into the 90s rave scene to pay tribute to her friend, The Prodigy’s Keith Flint, and Craig Green send out a collection inspired by the trashy mystery videos he’d watched on late night YouTube binges. One thing we’ve never heard during a post-show backstage interview or read in a painstakingly penned set of collection notes, though, is that Megan Fox’s butterfly tattoo has proved to be a big influence on someone’s work. That is, until rising photographers Reece + Dean dropped us a line about their latest editorial, which sees them join forces with fellow CSM grad, emerging designer Jonathon Kidd, and features a model with a replica of the ink in question – as recreated by make-up artist Grace Ellington. “I’ve just always loved Megan – but then, hasn’t everyone?” explains Kidd, laughing. “The tattoo is actually a quote from Shakespeare’s King Lear saying ‘We will all laugh at gilded butterflies’ and I’ve been obsessed with it ever since I can remember. With the collection having this fantasy feeling, and being so about wings, I knew I had to get it in there somewhere.” Shot in Reece + Dean’s signature cinematic style – and with the same magic and sense of unease that underpinned their recent series Based on a True Story – the shoot, which the three named Headlights, is presented in chapter-like form in much the same way as a fairytale would be. The idea makes sense, given the Brothers Grimm-esque nature of the editorial’s atmosphere and narrative. “The concept grew over a long period of time, coming from different experiences and feelings from my adolescence when I was growing up in Fazakerley, Liverpool,” says Kidd. “The main inspiration for the collection itself was actually a drive two years ago, when this wave of different emotions came over me – I started thinking about when all my friends got their first cars and we were going on midnight drives, and what would happen if the car stopped abruptly and all the passengers just got out and ran into the woods. I started imagining what you’d see if you were driving past, and then about these ethereal hybrid teenage creatures – which is where the idea of them being like deer in the headlights came from.” Shot in a forest-like setting, in Headlights a pack of young, suburban teens are captured surrounding a car that has swerved off the quiet country road at the sight of them, staring transfixed at the beams of light coming from its bumper. Later in the series they are beckoned by their mother deer, portrayed by model Gigi Hari, to perform a ritualistic dance in front of a bonfire. The clothing itself reflects the teenagers’ transformation into animals, with Kidd’s collection made up of glittering tunics, faux fur hooded scarves, and voluminous chaps which give those wearing them a faun-like appearance. “For me it’s the wing-like trousers that are the most important, though. Wings are mythical, mysterious, and full of movement, which are three things I wanted the collection to encompass. And the two faux fur hats I love, because they have that kind of early-2000s scene kid vibe. I really wanted to subvert whta would usually be considered normal, nondescript clothing to really accentuate the idea of this normal teen becoming a woodland creature.” As our conversation draws to a close, Kidd finishes by deciding on what mythical creature he himself would become. “A peryton, which is a stag with wings – but instead of a stag I’d be a faun with wings, a bit more delicate,” he confirms. “That, or I’d be a tiny fairy or sprite. I’ve been obsessed with Ferngully since I was a kid. I’m short, and I wear skirts all the time, so I think it would be quite fitting!” @jonathonkidd_

"Sonia Rykiel has taken it back to where it all began for its SS15 campaign and hit Saint-Germain-des-Prés in Paris with Elizabeth and Georgia May Jagger. Juergen Teller, shot the new ads in quintessentially Parisian parts of the 6th arrondissement: the parks, cafes and cobblestoned streets of the Left Bank. In fact, not too unlike the streets that the Jagger sisters' mother, Jerry Hall, probably walked down back when she modelled for Rykiel a few decades ago. The brand explains that keeping it in the family was part of the appeal. ""Their mother walked for Sonia Rykiel and they would come to the boutique. It's the story of a family and of a family business. It was great to have Juergen shoot them in such spontaneous fashion,"" artistic director Julie de Libran said. ""I loved the energy that passed between them and their individual beauty so equal yet unalike."" ""We all had a lot of fun on the shoot and the girls just typify the kind of woman that Julie designs for,"" stylist Alexia Niedzelski said. ""Sexy, modern and strong-willed."" Head here to check out all of this season's fashion campaigns.

"Over the course of his two-decade-long career, Alexander McQueen’s otherworldly shows transported audiences through his imagination, as the enfant terrible of London fashion swept them up to the foreboding hills of the Scottish Highlands (Highland Rape, AW95), the depths of the ocean (Plato’s Atlantis, SS10), and into the human psyche (Voss SS01). For those of us that weren’t there to experience them first hand, though, the most we’ve seen is via clips on YouTube. While it’s a testament to McQueen’s incredible talent that even glimpsed through the diminutive screen of an iPhone his sheer creativity is still overwhelming, the designer’s shows were never meant to be seen in such a way. But now, as long-awaited documentary McQueen is finally released, a new audience will get to see his work on a much bigger scale. “All of McQueen’s work was just so visually and emotionally spectacular, and so visceral – there was intent in every stitch of his work, in every presentation, in everything that he did,” explains Peter Ettedgui, who co-directed McQueen alongside Ian Bonhôte. “When we set out to make the film, we really strongly believed that what he did throughout his career needed to be brought to the big screen. While there was a dark undercurrent to everything he created, his work was so vibrant and full of life. And so was he.” “All of McQueen’s work was just so visually and emotionally spectacular, and so visceral – there was intent in every stitch of his work, in every presentation, in everything that he did” – Peter Ettedgui Documenting his journey by way of unseen home video footage filmed by friends and family, McQueen charts his time working in Savile Row and studying at Saint Martins, the early days of his eponymous label, his stratospheric ascent to living legend (which led to his surprise appointment at Givenchy at 27) and, eventually, his demise into drug addiction and depression. Woven throughout are personal snippets of his life away from the atelier, too, as McQueen is seen teasing his mum and sister at their family home in the East End, heading out into the night with a gang including stylist Katy England and assistant designer Sebastian Pons, and intermittently cackling and arguing with close friend and co-conspirator, ex-Vogue editor Isabella Blow. In a moment that’s particularly poignant, nephew Gary McQueen confirms the late designer had contracted HIV prior to his tragic death in 2010. The subject of much speculation, the time had come for his family to set the record straight according to Bonhôte. “It wasn’t something we knew Gary was going to bring, and we weren’t sure how to handle it at first,” he explains. “It wasn’t something that we wanted to put out there and sensationalise, of course, but it was something Lee’s family felt ready to tell us. Even when Lee was still alive HIV was no longer a death sentence, but it’s something that weighed heavily on his mind and contributed to what he put out into the world creatively. So we felt it was important in that respect.” With McQueen hitting UK cinemas this Friday, we sat down with directors Bonhôte and Ettedgui to discuss McQueen’s life, work, and relationships, and the daunting task of profiling one of Britain’s brightest and most beloved fashion talents. How did the film come about, and why did you think it was the right time to embark on the project? Peter Ettedgui: Lee’s story has been told before, of course, but in this case we wanted to go into it bigger and better, and really get to grips with his creativity in a way that hasn’t been done before. There’s something so cinematic about his work, and we’ve reached a time when the fashion documentary itself has become such a beautiful art form – just look at Dries, or Dior and I for example. Both myself and Ian felt very strongly that he deserved something visually spectacular that represented his life and work. And of course, it’s been almost a decade since he passed away – we wanted to bring his story to a new audience. Ian Bonhôte: We felt like we were filling in gaps as we went, too. The more we researched the more elements and facets of who he was we uncovered. There’s so much more to him than the poor, working class East London lad whose dad was a cabbie that the media portrayed him as – he was on a mission from day one. Neither of you have worked on a film about a figure in the fashion industry before. Why did you decide to make the move to cover the story of Lee McQueen? Ian Bonhôte: McQueen’s story isn’t entirely tied to fashion, and as we discovered more and more about him throughout our research process, we realised it was way bigger and way deeper than just the fashion industry and everything it entails. We’ve had people come and see the film knowing nothing about him, who fell totally in love with him, and then had him taken away from them all in the space of a couple of hours – they’re really rooting for him and experiencing what he went through, and they don’t necessarily know anything about the industry or what he did in it. So it wasn’t like we approached the project in the sense that we just wanted to do something related to fashion. It was more that we wanted to tell this amazing, human story. Peter Ettedgui: I think, actually, our distance from the fashion industry was a benefit when we set out on the project. I think someone in the industry would have been obsessed with the nitty gritty of the fashion side of things, but that had all really been tackled before. We got to grips with his work with the likes of Savage Beauty at The Met, and through thorough explorations of his work. All that has been done. This felt bigger. McQueen features commentary from many members of the designer’s family and some of his very close friends. Was it difficult to convince any of them to take part? Peter Ettedgui: It was difficult, yes – there were a lot of people for whom the pain was still too raw and while they might have been willing, they were just totally unable to speak about him in front of us and a camera crew. We knew that when we set out though. We wanted to document this extraordinary, creative, charismatic creature, but this was a story that was always going to end with a tragic, heartbreaking loss. And for many, that loss was too profound to put into words. Ian Bonhôte: We knew we had to put across that emotion, though – of those that spoke about him and those that couldn’t. That was Lee’s life, you know, there was this rich tapestry of emotion woven throughout everything he did. His shows were full of it. Whether that emotion was shock, or awe or incredulousness at the fact he was sending seemingly-raped women down the catwalk or whatever else. As he said himself about his shows and their often shocking subjects or themes, there was no beauty in coming out of something feeling like you’ve just sat down to Sunday lunch. And so that became our mantra when making McQueen. Where did you uncover all of the home video footage that appears in the film? Ian Bonhôte: We really had nothing when we started out, so we knew it was going to be a huge challenge. It was really Sebastian (Pons) – who we finally managed to convince to tell us Lee’s story and the story of their journey together after a long, long time – who changed all that. He ended up giving us hours of video footage shot over the course of their relationship as friends and colleagues, and suddenly we had Lee on screen telling us about his life. Aside from speaking to family, close friends, and colleagues, and looking at the old video footage, how else did you research his life? Peter Ettedgui: When we were looking through footage that we’d been given, we found McQueen telling whoever was filming him “if you want to know me, then read my autobiography,” and we really took that as a direct instruction. We wanted, as much as possible, to tell his story the way he would have wanted it to be told, which was through his work and his own words. And most important to us was avoiding some of the usual tropes: the gossip, the sensation, all the things the tabloids wrote about him. Ian Bonhôte: We did a lot of research on how to present the film visually, too. Looking back at his archives and the way he presented his work. When we were editing together the home footage, some of the team were like ‘we need to shoot more’ but Peter and I stuck to our guns and trusted our instincts and – a little like Lee himself did – took inspiration from everywhere, before amalgamating it all together until we had everything we needed. Why did you choose the shows you did to punctuate the story? Peter Ettedgui: There’s a darkness to most of what Lee sent down his catwalks, but we really wanted to include the collections and shows that best demonstrated the balance between that darkness and the light, and also his total dedication to his craft. There’s a scene when he is quietly pinning a sleeve to a toile and he’s just so ‘in’ his work at that moment, and so dedicated to it. It’s in stark contrast to this boisterous, filthy-mouthed young lad that’s also within him, bounding around his studio joking about and taking the piss out of his team. We’re moving towards a time when the subject of mental health in the fashion industry is something that’s finally being discussed and addressed. Do you think McQueen’s death had a part to play in this? Ian Bonhôte: Of course, the pressure on those in the fashion industry is enormous, but I think it’s a much broader conversation that’s opening up, and it’s not just focused on fashion. So whether Lee’s death was a catalyst...I don’t know. Peter Ettedgui: There’s no denying there are issues that need to be addressed in fashion, and it’s great that these conversations are opening up. But McQueen was the toughest person of all on himself. We talked one of his former boyfriends – who isn’t in the film – who told us that it wasn’t the industry’s pressures that got to him, it was his own. The main pressure and expectation came from Lee himself, to get bigger, and better, and reach for the sky with every subsequent project or collection. And that clearly just became too much. Whether that’s one of the reasons behind the shift in the landscape that’s currently happening was anything to do with Lee? I’m not sure. What is clear though, is how important a moment it is. McQueen is released in UK cinemas on June 8.

"You’re probably used to apocalyptic conversations about whether Instagram and/or the internet is destroying print mags. Obviously, we don’t agree, but the fact that this year has seen the closure of some of your faves (RIP Teen Vogue) does make you wonder about the future of the industry. There are, of course, rare and independent gems though that distance themselves from the monthly machine, publishing content they want, whenever they want. At the forefront of this wave of publications has to be Mushpit – which today celebrates its newly-released tenth issue. Started by Charlotte Roberts and Bertie Brandes back when they were students in 2011, Mushpit originally began as an antidote to the glossy, heavily advertised mags that already exist. With no ads and complete creative control, they used the magazine to communicate their struggles and triumphs as women living in London. For its latest issue – themed around the idea of ‘courage’ – the pair enlisted the help of creative director Richard Turley, who lent his talents on the art direction. Other contributors include photographer Joyce NG, Tyrone Lebon and Dazed’s art director Jamie Andrew Reid. Model Lily McMenamy – who the pair have wanted to shoot since Mushpit started – also appears on three variations of the cover. “She really gets Mushpit and we’re super happy and proud that she’s been a fan for such a long time,” they said. Here, we catch up with the pair on how Mushpit has changed since the first issue and what else to expect from its latest edition. What has the journey been like from the first issue to now? Charlotte Roberts and Bertie Brandes: We made the first issue when we were 21-year-old students splurging £200 on a 100 zine print run and moaning about internships, so we’ve slightly progressed now! We’ve definitely kept the same subversive, stubborn, fearless ethos as before we just know how to budget and use InDesign properly now. Issue 10 really is all we've ever wanted Mushpit to be and more – it feels like the ideas almost leaked themselves onto the page into a perfect mad melody and though it’s still somewhat messy and angry it feels structured and fluid too. It’s also been a year since we did the last one so this issue is packed full of a lot of ideas and feelings we had been storing up. Be prepared. What made you want to start the magazine, and do you still feel that way today? Charlotte Roberts and Bertie Brandes: In the beginning, it was a combination of boredom and frustration at the lack of outlets we felt we had access too. Everything was cliquey and seemingly inaccessible and we had a lot to say and nowhere to say it. Today, those general frustrations have become more nuanced and focused. As we’ve grown up so have the issues we discuss and explore; where once it was about boys and flatshares now its progressed to deeper and often more difficult topics like grief, heartbreak, modern malaise and dissatisfaction. We use humour as the key to discussing these things without being too worthy or earnest, there’s a strength in being funny about something heartbreaking or unfair. There’s definitely a feeling of resilience throughout all issues of the mag and we hope the readers feel this too. Any memorable highs/lows? Charlotte Roberts and Bertie Brandes: The high is every time we send the mag to the printers and then have a week off to faff about on outfits for the launch. The low is when we check our bank balance after we’ve sent it and realise we’ll have to recycle outfits from the last one. What are you most proud of achieving with the magazine? Charlotte Roberts and Bertie Brandes: This one definitely feels like the most archetypal Mushpit and the one we’ve been gearing up to make for a long time. We worked with Richard Turley as art director and he helped us bring so many ridiculous ideas to life in ways only he could ever do. Richard also helped us to develop an entire section which recreates the feeling of a panic attack; it’s visceral and very raw and we’re really proud of it. What do you wish you had known when you first started Mushpit? Charlotte Roberts and Bertie Brandes: The beauty of it is that we didn’t know anything, it was never a glorified portfolio it was just something we felt absolutely compelled to do! And still do! Can you tell us about theme for the new issue? Charlotte Roberts and Bertie Brandes: The theme for issue 10 is courage. After the chaos of issue 9, we wanted to refocus on strength and determination. The theme was heavily inspired by a painting of Fortitude by Botticelli and the idea that withstanding something is a great strength in and of itself – one that we tend to overlook. The past year has been so relentlessly dystopian, we thought we’d cut ourselves (and our readers) some slack. “The beauty of it is that we didn’t know anything, it was just something we felt absolutely compelled to do! And still do!” – Charlotte Roberts and Bertie Brandes What are some of the highlights? Charlotte Roberts and Bertie Brandes: Darcie Wilder’s two-part essay about love, life and spills is beautifully moving and one of the best things we’ve read this year, so we’re thrilled about publishing that. Rosie Mark’s Instagram story series is really new and exciting as well, and not something we’ve seen before. Working with Richard has been a constant highlight, he has a truly amazing brain, also a really good dress sense. The Joyce story based on the seven virtues was really great and tethered the ideas around courage and strength in the mag. We photographed Vanessa and her beautiful three daughters in their house in Dorset – it was a dream. Can you tell us about the covers? Charlotte Roberts and Bertie Brandes: We’re so excited to have worked so closely with Richard for this issue and knew from the off that we wanted to do something really new with the covers. The selfies of Lily – who has been our ideal cover girl since issue 1 – feel really honest and relevant. The text that surrounds them is a mix of pastiche, cheap poetry and passive aggressive emails sent between the three of us. Overall they hit every Mushpit requirement: profound, profoundly stupid and provocative. What does the future hold for Mushpit? Charlotte Roberts and Bertie Brandes: We’ve got some jobs lined up for the new year which keep the prang at bay but mainly we just plan on churning out issues in larger and larger quantities. Maybe robots will start producing them in 2018. #MakeMushpitMainstream...? Who knows. Mushpit issue 10 launches on December 19 at Horse Hospital from 7pm. Pre-order here.

"By and large, Tyler Gregory Okonma, aka Tyler the Creator is known for his music. That’s quickly changing thanks to his burgeoning fashion brand Golf Wang, which garnered media attention last year for its gay pride t-shirts (pictured) and, earlier this month, for its “Adolf Trump” t-shirts sporting a picture of the Republican candidate with the Nazi Party leader’s moustache. Now, the 25-year-old’s brand is in the press again, following the announcement that it will be staging a fashion show. The “presentation and experience” will take place as part of MADE LA – two days of fashion and culture exhibitions – in June and will see the debut of Golf Wang’s latest collection. Golf Wang, which is short for American hip hop collective Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All, was launched in 2011 and has since become known for its skate-meets-rap aesthetic – something that translates to oversized t-shirts, lots of stripes and even more colour. Tyler’s approach to fashion design is a personal one, stemming from his own style rather than some abstract or conceptual idea. “I just make whatever clothes I want to wear for the next five months and then run that. I don’t really put deep, intricate thought into it – it’s more like a feeling,” he said in an interview with Vogue. “I just figured, Why not? Why not do something different?” he said, speaking on how he responded to MADE’s proposal. “Not everybody in the upper fashion world is wearing all-black Saint Laurent pieces and is super pretentious. I want to show them a different world.” “Not everybody in the upper fashion world is wearing all-black Saint Laurent pieces and is super pretentious. I want to show them a different world” – Tyler the Creator Tyler won’t be the only noteworthy designer showing at MADE LA however – Jeremy Scott will be presenting his men’s SS17 and women’s pre-SS17 collections for Moschino as part of the two-day event. “As I show my own show in NYC and Moschino in Milan and London for the men’s, I’ve never had the luxury of doing a show in the city I live in and getting to sleep in my own bed that night!” said Scott. Made LA will take place in Los Angeles, on June 10 and 11
